### Summary

1. The global economy is weak, with Europe stagnating or in recession and
China struggling with secular structural issues. The US is the only spot
still doing well, but Felix Zulauf expects it to be weaker than it turned
out. He believes that the Fed made a mistake by easing too much and adding
too much liquidity, which has led to inflationary problems.

2. There is an extreme consensus in today's world that we are dealing with
a soft landing, according to the global fund manager survey by Bank of
America. This consensus will be tested because when forecasts and experts
agree on something to such a degree, usually something else happens. Felix
Zulauf expects the surprise in the first half of 2024 to be that the US
economy will turn out to be stronger than expected and could create problems
for the bond market.

3. The second half of 2024 is expected to be weaker due to higher inflation,
which will lead to another spike in yields and rates. This will impact the
markets and could result in both an important new high and an important low
in the market, as seen in previous years such as 2020, 2018, and 2022.

4. The stock markets are expected to go to new highs, but then a big decline
is predicted due to the concentration of assets in so few stocks. This could
lead to a situation where the market sees the low 3000 in the S&P in the
late summer of 2024 after having seen a high before in the first quarter.

5. The next wave of inflation in '25 and '26 is expected to be way above 10%
and will create problems for the bond market, which will then trigger the
next wave down in the stock market. This roller coaster picture is expected
to continue into the future.
