### Summary

1. The U.S. housing market is currently experiencing a "tug of war" between
tight resale supply and unaffordable prices due to high mortgage rates.

2. Inventory levels are still 37-39% below pre-pandemic levels, but
affordability is at its worst in four decades.

3. The market is currently in a "stalemate" with some markets experiencing
price declines and others seeing slight increases.

4. There is regional bi-furcation occurring in the housing market, with more
affordable areas seeing higher demand and prices rising while more expensive
areas are seeing less demand and falling prices.

5. The current status of inventory is that it is chronically tight due to low
interest rates and negative equity for homeowners, but there is potential
for inventory to come onto the market quickly if certain dynamics change
such as mortgage rates decreasing or employment increasing.
