### Summary

1. The global oil market is currently experiencing a period of relative
energy abundance due to technological advancements and political changes
that have allowed for increased production and supply.

2. This abundance has led to lower prices for natural gas, coal, and oil,
which has had positive impacts on the economy and human progress. However,
it also means that investors in the energy sector may need to consider this
context when making decisions.

3. The ongoing war in the Middle East is currently putting a floor under
oil prices, but there are many potential sources of oil around the world
that could lead to an increase in supply and potentially lower prices.

4. The definition of what constitutes "oil" has changed over time and now
includes natural gas liquids (NGLs) and other hydrocarbons that can be used
as fuel or feedstock for refining processes. This has led to a significant
increase in the amount of oil available on the market.

5. The Western Hemisphere, including North America and Latin America, is
already producing more oil than the Middle East with at least one hand tied
behind its back. If political obstacles can be overcome, there is potential
for even greater production from this region.
