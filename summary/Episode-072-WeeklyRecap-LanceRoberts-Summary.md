### Summary

1. The market is currently experiencing a bullish trend, with the S&P 500
reaching new all-time highs and low volatility. However, there are warning
signs of a potential correction in the future.

2. Corporate share buybacks have been a major driver of this bullish trend,
accounting for nearly 100% of net equity purchases since 2000. This has led
to concerns about misuse of capital and potential consequences down the line.

3. The Federal Reserve's recent dovish FOMC meeting has further fueled
market optimism, but there are still risks associated with this trend. A
break below the 20-day moving average could trigger a sharp decline in prices.

4. There is currently a high level of complacency among investors, with
household equity allocations near all-time highs and professional investor
allocation creeping upwards. This could make it difficult to predict when
a correction will occur.

5. Despite the bullish trend, there are still risks associated with investing
in equities at this time. Investors should be cautious and aware of potential
warning signs before making any investment decisions.
