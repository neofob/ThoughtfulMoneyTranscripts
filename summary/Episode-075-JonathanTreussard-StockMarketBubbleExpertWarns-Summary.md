### Summary

1. The global economy is currently walking a fine line between resilience
and risk, with the US economy being particularly strong but also facing
uncertainty in areas such as geopolitics and credit standing of major players.

2. Animal spirits have been running wild in the stock market, with the S&P 500
up over 1,000 points (roughly 25%) in the past four and a half months. This
has led to questions about whether this is a new era of easy gains or if
it's just another instance of rational exuberance.

3. The US consumer appears to be experiencing reality differently than what
official data suggests, with many people feeling uncertain and risk-averse
despite low unemployment rates and real wage growth. This discrepancy may
be due to the fact that inflation uncertainty is like a wage cut in real terms.

4. Quantitative tightening (QT) was put on hold after regional banks
went bankrupt in March 2023, leading to confusion and uncertainty in the
market. However, liquidity has been rising since October 2022, which has
supported economic growth and financial asset prices.

5. The current valuations of financial assets are not well-earned, as they
have reached the 97th percentile of all CAPE data going back to 1880. This
means that there is a significant risk if anything goes wrong in the market.
