### Summary

1. The speaker believes that consumers are essentially going on strike as
they relate to paying their debts, creating a culture of moral hazard not
only on Wall Street but also on Main Street. This is evidenced by the high
non-payment rate for student loans and record federal income tax non-payment.

2. Despite market enthusiasm for risk assets, there have been significant
corporate bankruptcies, commercial real estate issues, bank failures,
and increased consumer delinquencies. The speaker questions whether we
have dodged a bullet of recession or if the crisis is being forestalled by
accommodative leners expecting things to improve.

3. The global economy and financial markets are in limbo due to fundamental
backdrop still being negative with leverage built up from government, corporate
sectors, and consumers rolling at higher rates. However, perception can become
reality as seen in 2021 when banks continued to lend despite deteriorating
credit quality based on market expectations of lower rates.

4. The Fed's dovish talk after the last FOMC meeting ratified market
expectations for rate cuts and created a self-fulfilling prophecy where
leners are willing to extend credit expecting borrowers will be made whole
as rates cut. This has led to a no man's land situation with uncertainty
about whether the crisis can be averted or if it is just being delayed.

5. The speaker expresses humility in their macro view due to the power of
expectations and sits in cash on the sidelines while waiting for clarity. They
also mention that liquidity has played a role in pushing off recession,
supporting markets, and juicing economic growth but differing views exist
among experts regarding its sustainability.
