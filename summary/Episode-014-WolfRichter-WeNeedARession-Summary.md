### Summary

1. The global economy is currently experiencing divergence, with some
regions such as the US doing well while others like Europe and Canada are
softening. China also has its own problems but Japan's economy is doing
pretty good.

2. Markets cannot thrive in an environment of central bank tightening
and quantitative easing (QE) has been replaced by quantitative tightening
(QT). This means that markets may not see the same level of growth as they
did during QE periods.

3. The US economy is currently doing well, with record numbers of people
working and making money. However, there are concerns about the lag effect
of QT on the economy in the future.

4. Inflation has come down significantly from its peak but services inflation
remains high and could pose a risk to the economy.

5. The cost of servicing US federal debt is increasing as interest rates rise,
which could limit monetary policy options in the future.
