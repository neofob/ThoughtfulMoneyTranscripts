### Summary

1. The total market cap of equities as a percentage of GDP is at an all-time
high, indicating potential overvaluation in the stock market.

2. A bear market began in late 2021 and continued through 2022, with a brief
reprieve for some stocks in 2023. Phase two of this bear market is expected
to occur in 2024.

3. The mainstream financial media is not accurately portraying the state of
the economy or the stock market, as they are trying to convince people that
there will be a soft economic landing and that we are currently in a bull
market. However, this is not true.

4. The S&P 500 is still down 4% since its peak in November 2021, even after
adjusting for inflation. This decline is much worse when considering the
seven megacap tech stocks that have boosted the index. Other indices such
as the Russell 2000 and Nasdaq have also performed poorly.

5. The massive amount of debt accumulated due to low interest rates for an
extended period of time, along with unsustainable levels of asset bubbles,
are the main issues causing economic instability. These problems have not
been resolved and will continue to cause difficulties in the future.
