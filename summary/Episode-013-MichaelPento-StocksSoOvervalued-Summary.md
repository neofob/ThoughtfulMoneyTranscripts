### Summary


1. The guest believes that the hyped-up bull market of 2023 is not real
and that a recession is still coming. He cites evidence such as the S&P 500
being down 4% since its peak in November 2021, inflation-adjusted numbers
showing even worse performance, and only seven mega cap tech stocks boosting
the index while the other 493 are up just 4%.
2. The guest also believes that mainstream financial media is wrong about
a soft economic landing in 2024 and that a crash landing is still coming
due to unresolved issues such as unsustainable levels of debt accumulated
during a period of low interest rates from 2008-2022.
3. The guest cites the Russell 2000 being down 27% since November 2021 and the
60/40 portfolio, which includes bonds, performing even worse as evidence that
a crash landing is still coming. He also mentions that the salient issues
have not been resolved and will lead to a stronger destructive force than
if the recession had arrived sooner.
4. The guest uses his IDEC model for timing and has not been net short in
his portfolio for all of 2023, as he expected the recession to start but it
hasn't officially begun yet. He mentions that when a recession officially
begins, the average decline in the S&P 500 is 32% since the end of the Great
Depression and that this will likely happen in 2024.
5. The guest believes that the real economy is teetering on collapse but hasn't
happened yet and plans to go into detail about why he thinks it will happen
and what he will look for to determine when to get net short in his portfolio.
