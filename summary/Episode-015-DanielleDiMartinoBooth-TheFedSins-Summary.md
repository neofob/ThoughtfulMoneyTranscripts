### Summary

1. The global economy is currently in a recession, with rising unemployment
rates and negative non-farm payroll prints. This has led to a celebration
of lag effects pushing the economy more deeply into recession.

2. Quantitative tightening started in June 2023 and will continue to play
out later due to its lagged effect on monetary policy. The final rate hike
of June 2023 will also have a lagged effect, making it difficult for the
Fed to ease monetary policy effectively.

3. Disinflation is currently in the driver's seat and could potentially turn
into deflation next year. This means that inflation may not be as big of an
issue as some expect, and markets should position themselves accordingly.

4. The lag effect will become extremely real in the first quarter of 2024,
with non-financial refinancings becoming a concern. Companies have had the
luxury of preemptively refinancing their debt if they get inside of a 12
month window, but this may not be possible due to high interest rates and
tightening credit conditions.

5. The Fed's efforts to engineer a soft landing may be thwarted by the lag
effect continuing to push its way into the economy from whatever the last
marginal level of tightening was. This means that even if the Fed starts
cutting rates, it will still be fighting an uphill battle against the effects
of previous monetary policy decisions.
