### Summary

1. The global economy is currently being led by the US, which posted strong
economic growth in Q4 2022. However, Europe and Asia Pacific are struggling
with their own challenges.

2. Inflation remains a concern for many economists, including Oliver Rushton,
co-founder of Trueflation. He believes that current inflation measurement
tools like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are outdated and do not accurately
reflect what households actually experience.

3. To address this issue, Trueflation uses over 10 million data points
to calculate a more accurate measurement of inflation in real-time using
blockchain technology. This allows them to track changes in prices across
various categories such as food, housing, transportation, and healthcare.

4. According to Rushton, the current true inflation rate is around 2%,
which is below the Fed's target of 2%. However, he warns that this number
could rise due to factors like wage growth and increased spending on services.

5. Looking ahead, Rushton believes that inflation will remain sticky for
some time before it starts to come down. He also notes that there are secular
wins behind higher labor costs from reshoring, which will continue to drive
up prices in the long term.
