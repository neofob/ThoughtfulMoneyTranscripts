### Summary

1. The global economy and financial markets are currently experiencing a
bull cycle due to the rise of liquidity, which is expected to last until
late 2025. This is driven by factors such as US fiscal expansion and positive
wealth effects on consumers.

2. Liquidity is a key driver of asset prices and is defined as the capacity
of capital in the financial system, rather than just the cost of capital. It
is important for debt financing, which makes up a significant portion of
global debt.

3. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet size and liquidity-generating
parts are important factors to consider when analyzing its impact on the
economy. Currently, central banks around the world are expanding their
balance sheets, leading to an increase in global liquidity.

4. The flow of money through the financial system is a critical factor
for understanding economic trends and making predictions about financial
markets. This can be measured using various indicators such as M1 or M2,
but these may not fully capture the complexity of modern financial systems.

5. Understanding the relationship between liquidity and asset prices is
important for predicting market movements. For example, a rise in global
liquidity has been associated with strong performance in technology stocks,
corporate debt, and certain commodities markets.

6. The flow of money through the financial system can also impact
economic activity more broadly. In this case, it may have contributed to
stronger-than-expected US economic growth despite predictions of a recession.
