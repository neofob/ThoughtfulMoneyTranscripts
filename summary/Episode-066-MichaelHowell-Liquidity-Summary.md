### Summary

1. Michael Howell predicts that liquidity will continue to rise until the
end of 2025, driving asset prices higher and leading to a peak in the cycle
around that time.

2. He believes that the current party is still in its early hours and has
room to run, with rising net liquidity inflows continuing to support both
the economy and financial markets.

3. Howell sees inflation as a potential risk to his outlook, but does not
believe it is likely to occur. He also identifies central bank errors or
geopolitical events as possible risks that could disrupt his predictions.

4. He notes that there are signs of rotation in the market, with technology
stocks continuing to perform well but other sectors beginning to gain
traction. This suggests that the rally may be broadening out and becoming
more sustainable.

5. Howell also discusses the potential for a significant pickup in inflation
or a central bank error as risks to his outlook. He believes that these factors
could cause liquidity to decline, leading to a correction in asset prices.
