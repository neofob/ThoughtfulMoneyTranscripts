### Summary

1. Alf Peccatiello believes the global economy is transitioning from high
inflation to low inflation and eventually deflation, which will lead central
banks to cut interest rates aggressively.

2. He predicts a potential second leg of recessionary vibes that could
surprise markets in 2024, as they are currently not pricing it in.

3. Alf sees the US economy flirting with a recession, but market participants
are not concerned yet due to low unemployment and mildly higher inflation.

4. He believes inflation will go below the Federal Reserve's target of 2%
and could even reach 1%, which would lead central banks to cut rates more
aggressively than markets expect.

5. Alf thinks there is a risk that excessive euphoria in the early stages of
this transition could trap investors with aggressive positioning, unprepared
for a potential recession in 2024.
