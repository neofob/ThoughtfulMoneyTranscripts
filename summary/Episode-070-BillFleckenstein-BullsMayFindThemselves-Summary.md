### Summary

1. Passive capital inflows have been a major driver of equity prices,
particularly in the "magnificent seven" stocks. However, some of these
companies are now struggling and there are signs that passive flows may
be stalling or even reversing. This could potentially lead to asset prices
declining just as powerfully as they rose.

2. The global economy is currently experiencing stagflation, with high
inflation and low economic growth. The bond market seems confident in the
Federal Reserve's ability to manage this situation, but there are concerns
about the consequences of Fed policy and fiscal stimulus on inflation.

3. Passive capital flows have turned the stock market from a leading
indicator into a lagging indicator, as fewer people are doing research and
analysis. These flows are largely driven by 401k contributions and target
date funds, which allocate a significant portion of their assets to equities.

4. The bond market may eventually take the printing press away from the Fed
if it loses credibility due to inflation or other factors. This could have
major implications for financial markets and the economy as a whole.

5. There are concerns about the sustainability of current levels of debt and
deficit spending, particularly in light of higher interest rates. The maturity
wall facing corporate America is also a potential source of friction and angst.
