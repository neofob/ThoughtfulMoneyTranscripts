### Summary

1. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world and investors should not
expect this cycle to look like previous ones.

2. Fiscal policy has played a significant role in shaping the economy
since 2020, with governments spending unprecedented amounts of money into
existence. This is different from previous cycles that relied on private
sector credit creation.

3. The Federal Reserve's recent move to lower interest rates and signal
future rate cuts is not as dovish as it seems because the real rate (the
rate above expected inflation) has remained constant. However, this could
change if inflation expectations continue to fall.

4. The long-term bond market may struggle from here on out due to increased
uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's commitment to its 2% inflation target
and potential for more fiscal spending in the future.

5. Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios away from large cap
stocks, particularly those that have performed well recently (the "Mag-7"),
and towards small caps, foreign assets, value stocks, and equal weight indices.
