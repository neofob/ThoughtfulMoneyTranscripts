### Summary

1. The Federal Reserve is meeting soon and their financial conditions or
market liquidity are inflationary in nature, which is a concern for the Fed.

2. November was a good month for global bond and stocks, adding over 11
trillion in market cap, making it the second biggest monthly gain in history.

3. The best month since November 2020 when stimulus checks were being
distributed and the Fed was doing quantitative easing (QE).

4. Lance Roberts has been holding on to most of his TLTs and buying more
for his personal account, which has worked out well in the short term as
global bonds had their best month since December 2008.

5. The market is currently overbought and a correction is expected before
the Santa Claus rally at the end of the year.
