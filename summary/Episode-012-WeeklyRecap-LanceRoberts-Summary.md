### Summary

1. The global bond and stock markets added over 11 trillion in market cap
this month, the second biggest monthly gain in history. This was due to a
mildly up week for the markets and a pretty good month of November.

2. Global bonds had their best month since December 2008 and US bonds soared
to their best month since May 1985. The bond market did especially well
this month, with yields falling below 4.3%. This is due to the impulse for
liquidity from the Federal Reserve's recent actions.

3. Lance Roberts has been bullish on bonds and has seen a victory lap in
his call as TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF) has performed well
recently. He advises taking profits here, but not selling all positions as
the bond trade is still oversold.

4. The Federal Reserve's recent actions have contributed to this surge in
liquidity and market cap, but it appears that the impulse for this liquidity
may be ending soon. This could lead to a correction in the markets.

5. Lance Roberts believes that the Fed will need to come out with a more
hawkish message at their upcoming meeting in order to pull some of the froth
out of the market and work off some overbought conditions. He is hoping
for this outcome as it would provide a better entry point for buying bonds
or stocks.
