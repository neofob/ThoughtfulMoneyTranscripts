### Summary

1. The global economy is in a worse state than what the consensus suggests,
with major parts of it already in recession, including China and parts of
Europe such as Germany and France. In the US, despite a 4.9% GDP growth in
the last quarter, consumer spending (which accounts for 70% of the economy)
is showing signs of weakness, with declining retail sales, job cuts, and
layoffs expected to increase.

2. The October CPI numbers suggest that inflation may be moderating faster than
expected, which could mean an end to the Federal Reserve's aggressive campaign
of interest rate hikes and a potential reversal in the three-year beating
suffered by the bond market. However, this trend shift is not yet confirmed.

3. Fred Hikey believes that the US will head into a deep recession at the
end of 2022 or early 2024, driven by the lag effect of the Fed's actions
and the erosion effects of higher rates and quantitative tightening (QT). He
also thinks that the Fed cannot act again to save the day due to inflation
expectations remaining high.

4. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey showed a 5% decline
in October, marking the fourth straight month of decline. This indicates
weakened retail sales and an increase in unemployment rates. Additionally,
there has been a significant slowdown in industrial production and housing,
with mortgage applications at a 28-year low and existing home sales down to
a 13-year low.

5. Fred Hikey is not optimistic about the US stock market next year,
especially if it enters a recession. He believes that the Magnificent Seven
tech stocks have been attracting all the money in a wild FOMO-driven frenzy,
taking valuations to beyond nosebleed levels, and will eventually flame out
as fundamentals do not support them.
