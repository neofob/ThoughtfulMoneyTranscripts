### Summary

1. The global economy is facing downside risks with a potential global
recession on the horizon. The US and Canada are cooling off, while the UK is
stagnant and Germany is heading into negative growth. China is experiencing
debt deflation similar to the US real estate morass in 2006-2007.

2. David Rosenberg sees a potential recession next year, with optimism for
bonds and caution towards equities. He believes that central banks around the
world have implemented aggressive interest rate hikes, which may now be coming
to an end. This could present opportunities in the long treasury bond market.

3. The economy is currently experiencing a "soft landing," but this is
often a prelude to a recession. Historically, there have only been three
instances where the US avoided a hard landing after a Fed tightening cycle:
the mid-1960s, mid-1980s, and mid-1990s. In these cases, the Fed stopped
tightening once the yield curve flattened, but this time around, they continued
to tighten into an inverted yield curve due to missing inflation signals.

4. The lag effect of interest rate changes means that the full impact on the
economy may not be felt for some time. This could lead to a recession arriving
later than expected, as was the case in 2007-2008. Rosenberg emphasizes the
importance of understanding these lags when making economic predictions.

5. The Federal Reserve's reaction function and deliberative nature may
cause them to be slow to react to changing economic conditions. This could
lead to overcorrections, as seen in past interest rate cycles. Rosenberg
believes that the Fed will start cutting rates by May 2023 if they follow
historical patterns.
