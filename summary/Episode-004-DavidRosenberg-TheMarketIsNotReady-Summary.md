### Summary

1. The Federal Reserve has implemented an aggressive interest rate hike
campaign, which may now be over. This could present opportunities in the
long treasury bond market.

2. David Rosenberg is a highly respected economist and award-winning
researcher who believes that the global economy is fraught with downside
risk and teetering on the brink of a global recession. He sees signs of
slowdowns in major economies such as the US, Canada, UK, Germany, and China.

3. Rosenberg retains a constructive stance on the fixed income market but
remains circumspect about the overly inflated and highly concentrated US
stock market.

4. The lag effect of interest rate changes is an important factor to consider
when assessing economic trends. Historically, recessions have occurred
after the Fed's tightening cycle has ended, not during it. This suggests
that a potential recession may still be on the horizon despite recent signs
of resilience in the US economy.

5. The yield curve is currently inveterate and has been for some time, which
is unusual given that it is only inveterate 15% of the time. This could
indicate that bond markets are expecting lower interest rates in the future
due to a projected slowdown or recession.
