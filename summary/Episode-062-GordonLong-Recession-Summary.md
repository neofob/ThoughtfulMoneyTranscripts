### Summary

1. The global economy and financial markets are currently experiencing a
period of growth and low inflation, leading many to believe that the "soft
landing" or "no landing at all" narrative is true. However, Gordon Long,
an expert in macroeconomics and world geopolitics, believes that this is
not the case and that there will be a recession coming.

2. The economy has underlying issues related to debt levels, financing
of debt, risk premiums, duration risk on bond markets, and equity risk
premiums on stock markets. Despite these concerns, Long sees an upswing
in the global economy due to liquidity being put into the market. However,
he believes that this will not last and a recession is coming, although it
may take longer than originally thought.

3. The unemployment numbers are worse than reported, with jobless claims
being almost a joke. The Bureau of Labour Statistics has even questioned
their own numbers in the FOMC meeting. Long predicts that the rececession
will start to be felt later in the fall and into next year.

4. On the market side, it is currently on a cusp where it could break at any
time due to liquidity. However, there are many things that could trigger
a correction such as commercial real estate crisis with banking crisis or
other areas of concern. Despite this, Long believes that the markets will
hold up for now but eventually fall into rececession.

5. In terms of investment strategy, Long advises taking risk off the table
in equities and moving towards bonds and credit markets. He also suggests
being cautious about investing in meme stocks or using momentum trading
strategies as they can be volatile and unpredictable.
