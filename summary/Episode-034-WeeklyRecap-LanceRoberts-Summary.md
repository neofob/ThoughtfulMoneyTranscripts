### Summary

1. The conversation begins with Adam and Lance discussing the cold weather
in Houston, Texas. They talk about how people who live there are not used
to such low temperatures.

2. Lance mentions that he will be speaking at an event on January 27th about
bonds and investing in the new year. He says that tickets are available
online and that it is a live event, so attendees must physically attend.

3. Adam asks Lance for his thoughts on the current market conditions. Lance
says that the market is predicting 160 basis points of rate cuts in 2024,
but he questions whether this is realistic given the potential for economic
crisis. He also mentions that there has been a lot of government spending
recently and that this could be contributing to decent employment numbers
and economic growth.

4. Adam asks Lance about his recent conversations with people who track
government spending and industries that benefit from it. Lance says that there
is still a lot of money available for projects, but finding shovel-ready
products has been a challenge. He also mentions that this could be a sign
of higher inflation in the future.

5. Adam asks Lance about his thoughts on the recent market rally and whether
he thinks it will continue. Lance says that the market is currently trading
sideways and working off an overbought condition, but that there may be
another leg up coming soon. He also mentions that presidential election
years tend to have choppy markets in the first three months of the year,
followed by stronger performance later on.

6. Adam asks Lance about his thoughts on the potential for a recession and
whether it is higher than most people realize. Lance says that he has been
tracking full-time employment relative to the working age population and that
there was a sharp drop in this ratio last month. He also mentions that CEO
confidence surveys are showing low levels of confidence, which could lead
to job cuts and reduced demand.

7. Adam asks Lance about his thoughts on bonds and whether he thinks they will
continue to perform well. Lance says that he sold some bond positions recently
because they were overbought, but that he is now looking for opportunities
to add more exposure. He also mentions that if the Fed starts reducing
quantitative tightening in May and moves back to quantitative easing by
October, this could be a tailwind for bonds.

8. Adam asks Lance about his thoughts on inflation and whether it will continue
to rise or stabilize. Lance says that he thinks inflation is currently
stabilizing around 3%, but that the Fed's recent talk of cutting rates with
inflation at this level is concerning. He also mentions that there may be some
systemic financial risks in the repo market, similar to what happened in 2019.

9. Adam asks Lance about his thoughts on the potential for a peaceful settlement
in Ukraine and whether it could have an impact on markets. Lance says that he
does not think this would have a major impact on markets, but that it could
be positive for companies involved in rebuilding efforts. He also mentions
that there may be some negative impacts for defense contractors if support
for Ukraine is reduced.

10. Adam asks Lance about his thoughts on the recent approval of a Bitcoin
ETF and whether he thinks this will have an impact on markets. Lance says
that he does not think this will have a major impact on markets, but that it
could lead to more volatility in the price of Bitcoin. He also mentions that
there may be some regulatory risks for Bitcoin if there are more negative
events involving fraud or investor losses.

11. Adam asks Lance about his thoughts on healthcare premiums and whether
he thinks they will continue to rise. Lance says that this is a result of
government involvement in the healthcare system and that it has created a
situation where healthy people are subsidizing sick people. He also mentions
that there may be some regulatory risks for healthcare companies if there
are more negative events involving fraud or investor losses.

12. Adam asks Lance about his thoughts on recent social media interactions
and whether he thinks people should try to control their behavior in these
situations. Lance says that it is important to always strive to be the best
person you can be, even if this means not engaging with negative comments
or actions from others. He also mentions that trust and respect are the most
valuable currency in life and that losing them can have serious consequences.
