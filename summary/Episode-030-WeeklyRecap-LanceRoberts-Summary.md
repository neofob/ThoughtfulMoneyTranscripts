### Summary

1. The conversation is between Adam Teget and Lance Roberts of Real Investment
Advice discussing the market recap for the first week of the year, as well
as an event hosted by Real Investment Advice in January 27th featuring
Greg Valliere and Michael Leibowitz talking about the presidential election
and bonds.

2. The conversation also touches on the topic of inflation and interest
rates, with Lance Roberts expressing concern that there is a risk to the
market if there is a disconnect between Wall Street's expectations of six
rate cuts and the Fed saying three. He predicts a 5-10% correction in the
market sooner than later as these two views need to be realigned.

3. The conversation also touches on the topic of earnings and profitability,
with Lance Roberts stating that they cannot outgrow the economy and if the
economy slows, companies will protect their profits by reducing costs such
as labor. He also mentions that there is a finite ability for corporations
to continue doing share buybacks long term.

4. The conversation touches on the topic of employment, with Lance Roberts
stating that there are no signs of a rececession yet and that deficit
spending is surging which will help support economic growth longer than
expected. However, he also mentions that the question now is "what's next"
as government needs a reason to do another five trielliion in spending.

5. The conversation touches on the topic of portfolio return expectations
by investors being too high, with Lance Roberts stating that there has been
an excessive rate of returns since the financial crisis and this has skewed
investor expectations for future returns. He also mentions that there is
a big mismatch between what a portfolio can actually generate versus what
investors expect.

6. The conversation touches on the topic of bonds, with Lance Roberts stating
that their thesis hasn't changed at all and they still expect interest rates
to go back up near term. He also mentions that bond technicals are getting
oversold and this will make it a great buying opportunity in the next two
to three weeks.

7. The conversation touches on the topic of trade, with Lance Roberts stating
that they added Diamondback drilliing (FA & G) and started positions in Eli
Lilley and UnitedHealthcare. He also mentions that they sold CVS last year
for tax loss selling reasons but will be buying it back soon as fundamentals
are great.

8. The conversation touches on the topic of mental health, with Adam Teget
stating that he feels like we have an epidemic of depression and anxiety in
this country that has become accepted as a reason to not lean into life or do
things. He also mentions that instead of expecting the market to make you rich,
it should be used to keep the value of your wealth on pace with inflation.

9. The conversation touches on the topic of parenting, with Adam Teget stating
that one of the kindest things a parent can do for their kids is allow them
to deal with adversity and not shield or coddle them. He also mentions that
this will help develoop self-confidence and skills that make them successful
in life.

10. The conversation touches on the topic of shame, with Adam Teget stating
that there may be such a thing as a healthy degree of shame and it can serve
as a powerful motivator for individuals to take corrective action. He also
mentions that society has removed this emotion from our lives which serves
against us as individuals and certainly serves against society.
