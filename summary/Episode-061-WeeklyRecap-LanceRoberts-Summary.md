### Summary

1. The conversation is between Adam Taggart and Lance Roberts discussing
the current state of the stock market and economy.

2. Ray Dalio recently stated that "the stock market doesn't look very bubblish"
while Bank of America put out a report saying the S&P 500 is "egregiously
expensive." The two are talking about different aspects of the market,
sentiment vs fundamentals.

3. Lance Roberts explains that sentiment in the market is not yet at bubble
levels but there is still room for it to grow. He uses the example of the
dot-com bubble and how investors were paying up massive amounts for companies
with no earnings or revenue.

4. The fundamental valuations of the S&P 500 are trading between 80 and
95 percent of their historical deciles, indicating that the market is
expensive. Earnings and revenue growth are not keeping pace with what
investors are paying for stocks.

5. Lance Roberts believes that there may be a correction in the summer but
the market will finish positive by the end of the year due to it being a
presidential election year. He warns against using this as an excuse to buy
into the market now, as the market could still be negative at certain points
during the year.

6. The conversation also touches on the topic of retail investors and their
tendency to buy high and sell low, leading to large drawdowns in their
portfolios. Lance Roberts advises against following the sentiment of Wall
Street experts who are trying to sell products rather than looking out for
the best interest of investors.
