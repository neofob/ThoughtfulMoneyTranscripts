### Summary

1. The Federal Reserve is rumored to be ending its campaign of quantitative
tightening (QT) and has guided the market to expect three rate cuts in
2024. However, inflation remains a concern as it has not yet reached the
"last mile" to two percent.

2. Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, is guardedly bullish on the
economy but concerned about inflation and potential exogenous problems such
as Red Sea shipping and a turn in the housing market. He believes that the
global economy is growing at trend or slightly above trend, which could put
upward pressure on inflation.

3. The current inflation rate is 3.4% using the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
year-over-year basis, down from 9%. However, Bianco suggests that this may
not be the "last mile" and that inflation rates have already bottomed out
at 3.0%, seven months ago.

4. The economy is currently in a state of spending mentality, with
people more willing to spend their savings than before. This could keep
inflation sticky and frustrate the idea that interest rates will come down
significantly. Additionally, there are concerns about labor hoarding and
potential strikes as workers feel more comfortable quitting their jobs.

5. Bianco believes that the economy has changed post-pandemic, with trends
such as remote work and spending mentalities shifting. He suggests that
this could lead to a higher inflation rate than previously seen in similar
instances. However, he acknowledges that his opinion is an outlier compared
to other analysts who are more pessimistic about the economy.

6. The global fund manager survey by Bank of America found that 59% of their
fund managers expect a recession in the next 12 months. Bianco participated
in the Roundtable Prime at Double Line's offices and noted that many people
were worried about the economy, but he was more concerned about inflation.

7. In terms of markets, Bianco is guardedly bullish on equities but
cautious due to concerns about inflation. He believes that there are still
opportunities for growth in certain sectors, such as technology and healthcare,
but investors should be aware of potential risks.
