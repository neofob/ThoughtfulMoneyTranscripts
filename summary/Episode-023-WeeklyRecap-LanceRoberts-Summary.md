### Summary

1. The market has been on a strong rally since October, retracing all losses
from the summer and reaching new highs for the year. This is due to extreme
negative sentiment and oversold conditions in the market at that time, as
well as a need for mutual fund managers, pension funds, and hedge funds to
balance their portfolio weights.

2. The rally has been broadening out, with small caps performing better
and speculative investments such as ARK's disruptive technology ETF seeing
significant gains. However, the market is now extremely overbought on multiple
metrics, including the relative strength index being above 70.

3. There may be a pullback in the market after the Santa Claus rally (the
last five days of the year and the first two days of January), as the market
works off some of its extreme overbought condition. However, there is no
real evidence of a risk bias to the downside that should keep investors out
of equities at this time.

4. The Federal Reserve's decision to potentially reduce interest rates
without a recession could provide support for the economy and keep it out of
rececession for longer than expected. This, along with continued liquidity
in the market, could lead to positive performance for both the economy and
markets over the next couple of years.

5. It is important for investors to maintain some level of risk control
and bias towards understanding that there are risks present in the market,
while also participating in the current rally. This can be done by using tools
such as daily money flow indicators to identify short-term signals and weekly
analysis to smooth out short-term volatility and look at longer-term trends.
