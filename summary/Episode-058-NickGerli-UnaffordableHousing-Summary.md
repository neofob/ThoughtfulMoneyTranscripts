### Summary

1. The US housing market is still in a bubble with home prices adjusted for
income and inflation remaining even higher than the 2006 bubble and about
30 to 40% overvalued from their long-term norms.

2. There has been a collapse in buyer demand due to lack of affordability,
with mortgage applications to buy a house at their lowest level since 1995
and multiple leading indicators suggesting that the spring 2024 housing
market is setting up to be a ghost town with very little buyer activity.

3. Despite this crash in buyer demand, sellers on the US housing market are
still refusing to acknowledge reality and are listing their prices high,
creating a standoff between buyers and sellers.

4. The Federal Reserve has signaled three rate cuts in 2024, but it may not
be enough to solve the unaffordability issue as mortgage rates would need to
come down significantly from current levels for homebuyers to afford homes
at their inflated prices.

5. There are regional differences in the housing market with some states
like Florida and Texas experiencing a downturn while others like New York
or Illinois seeing price increases and low inventory.
