### Summary

1. Alf Peccatello believes that the global economy is slowing down and that
it will take time for the tightening in financial conditions and interest
rates to feed into the real economy. He notes that there are signals of this
happening, such as a recent job report from the Federal Reserve showing that
private sector jobs have been added at an average rate of 200,000 per month
over the past three months, but with a concentration in certain sectors and
a slowdown in hiring by cyclical industries.

2. Peccatello explains that the lag effect of interest rate hikes is starting
to arrive, as it takes time for higher rates to impact economic growth. He
predicts that the next six to nine months will be interesting, as historical
trends suggest that if interest rates are kept above 5% for a long period
of time without real GDP growth keeping pace, people may start to question
whether a recession is imminent.

3. Peccatello notes that the US economy is better equipped than people think
to handle higher interest rates for a longer period of time due to Americans
being smart about locking in low interest rates and extending the maturity
of their debt. However, he warns that this process takes time and that it
is starting to happen now.

4. Peccatello discusses the potential impact of higher interest rates on
highly leveraged companies, particularly those with junk ratings below
investment grade. He notes that these companies were able to issue bonds at
low interest rates between 2015 and 2021, but are now facing much higher
borrowing costs due to a combination of high Treasury yields and credit
spreads. This could lead to a slowdown in hiring and economic activity as
these companies struggle to refinance their debt.

5. Peccatello also touches on the potential for layoffs and job market
weakness, particularly in cyclical industries that are more sensitive to
changes in interest rates and economic conditions. He notes that there
is already evidence of this happening, with initial claims data remaining
flat but WARN Act notices (which require companies to give advance notice
of layoffs) surging over the past six months.
