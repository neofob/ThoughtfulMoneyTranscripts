### Summary

1. The conversation is between Adam Taggart and Lance Roberts discussing
the current state of the stock market and their expectations for a near-term
cooling off period before resuming again into the end of the year.

2. Lancce Roberts mentions that he will be writing an article on this
topic, which will include historical facts and seasonal data to support his
argument. He also explains that mutual funds have to distribute all capital
gains, dividends, and interest for the year in December, which can cause
a bit of selling pressure and lead to a correction before the Santa Claus
rally into the end of the year.

3. Adam Taggart mentions that Lancce Roberts was previously criticized for
his view on the market during October when many people were expecting a crash
due to bad data, but instead the market continued to rise. Now those same
people are saying that a correction will never happen and it's just going
to continue upward.

4. Lance Roberts explains that he has been talking about this potential
correction for about two weeks on Twitter and advising people to use the
rally as an opportunity to rebalance risk, take profits, and do tax loss
selling. He also mentions that his Twitter feed is filled with comments
saying that he doesn't understand momentum in the markets and it will just
continue to carry on.

5. Lance Roberts explains that this is always the case when markets are
trending, as investors historically buy low and sell high because they do the
opposite of what they should be doing at any given time. He also mentions that
technical indicators such as overbought conditions and extended risk-reward
ranges support his view on a correction in the near term.
