### Summary

1. The Federal Reserve did not cut rates at its meeting on Wednesday and is
expected to have three rate cuts this year, which may be overly priced in
by the market.

2. The job report for Friday showed a strong employment situation with wage
growth doing well, pushing out a potential rate cut even further.

3. The market sold off on Wednesday but quickly pivoted back and is expected
to have a correction this year, likely around summer due to uncertainty
surrounding the presidential election.

4. Earnings season has been positive for a handful of stocks, with most
companies beating lowered estimates, but overall earnings growth is not at
a robust level to justify high stock prices.

5. The market is currently in a state of multiple expansion and setting new
highs on Friday, with the only correction being needed due to overbought
conditions.
