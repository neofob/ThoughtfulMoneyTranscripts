### Summary

1. The global economy is experiencing a different macroeconomic cycle than
most people have experienced over their lifetime, driven by nomal wage
growth which supports nominl spending growth and continued expansion in the
economy. This can be very persistent as there are no unsustainable flows
related to it like in big credit or asset price booms.

2. The US economy has been stronger and longer than many people expected due to
this income-oriented cycle, with the Federal Reserve continuously disappointing
expectations of swift shifts to easing and economic weakness. This is true
for other developed economies as well, where significant deceleration was
expected but not seen.

3. Globalization may have peaked, pushing the world order into a more
fragmented state due to supply chain vulnerabilities revealed by the COVID
pandemic and geopolitical fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This
could lead to trade globalization decreasing, which would create a radically
different dynamic than most people are used to as it has been increasing
for decades.

4. The shift from optimized production across the world to parallel production
within each economic block will be inflationary but also growth positive in the
short term due to investment required to build infrastructure and services
capacity that did not previously exist. This could create a significant
stimulus for economies like the US, particularly if they have demo graphical
challenges and need to reshore or rebuild para lel infra structure.

5. The US may be well positioned for this potential post-peak globalization
world due to its resilience in reinventing and recreating over time despite
challenges from various powers that have threatened it. However, there are
still points of view out there that say the US has had a great ride but its
best days are behind it due to issues like debt burden or erosion of the
middle class.
