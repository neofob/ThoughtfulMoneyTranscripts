### Summary

1. Inflation is expected to rise again due to growing global economic
imbalances and the reckless amount of fiscal spending. This could have
implications for investors who need to prepare proactively.

2. The commodities industry has been in a consolidation period, with certain
commodities being hot while others are not. However, hard assets are expected
to improve in terms of appreciation.

3. The global economy is currently experiencing a slowdown, but the reckless
amount of fiscal spending has prevented it from becoming a full-blown
recession. The lack of companies leading the market and the deterioration
of labor markets are also concerns.

4. Gold prices have been rising, which could be an indication that
further debasement of currencies is expected. This could lead to inflation
reaccelerating at a faster pace than currently anticipated.

5. The five pillars of inflation include chronic under-investments in
natural resource industries, labor cost increases, reckless fiscal spending,
deglobalization, and immigration. Illegal immigration is increasing in the
US, which could drive up shelter costs and ultimately lead to higher consumer
goods and services prices.
