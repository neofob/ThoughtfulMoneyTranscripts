### Summary

1. The market has been grinding down and there were predictions of a big
break, but the stocks have rallied into the end of the year as predicted by
Lancé Roberts due to technical and historical data.

2. There is a lot of negative sentiment and oversold positioning by
professional managers which led to this rally. Stock buybacks also played
a role in this rally.

3. The narrative has shifted from debt and deficit concerns, higher interest
rates, energy prices going up to $150 per barrel, and economic slowdown to
now yields dropping to around 4.5% on the 10-year Treasury and stock prices
railling sharply due to better than expected earnings.

4. The Fed has pretty much come out saying they are done hiking rates and
Tim Rose recently said that in the December meeting, the challenge for the
Fed is going to be how to recraft their message into this "we're done for
now" scenario.

5. Lancé Roberts warns against jumping on these narratives as markets don't
work that way and it often leads to poor investment decisions. He advises
investors to focus on possibilities, not probabilities.

6. The bond market has also seen a rally with yields dropping from 5% to
around 4.4%. This is due to the latest CPIs coming in lower than expected and
economic growth slowing down. Lancé Roberts expects this trend to continue
into next year.
