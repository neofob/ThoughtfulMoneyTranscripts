### Summary

1. The US economy is growing faster than expected with inflation under control,
jobs plentiful, and consumer households resilient. However, consumers report a
different story with the cost of living at crippling levels, forcing them to
stop saving and put an increasing amount of their living costs on revolving
credit with record high APRs.

2. The job market is not as hungry for workers as government numbers suggest,
with hiring freezes and layoffs prevalent. Consumers looking for new jobs
report that the market is tougher than it appears.

3. Danielle Park, president and portfolio manager for Venable Park Investment
Council, Inc., believes that a downturn in the global economy is overdue. She
notes that the expansion was driven largely by low interest rates and high
consumption, but now the stimulus has been consumed, and we are heading into
the contraction part of the cycle.

4. The worst job losses and bear market losses typically happen once the
Fed starts cutting rates in response to a slowing economic picture. This is
because it takes just as long for rate cuts to filter through the economy
as it does for rate hikes.

5. Park advises investors to be forward-looking, assess probabilities, and
protect themselves from losses over time rather than chasing trends. She
notes that we cannot afford to be backward-looking in our analysis because
the only certain data is what has already happened.
