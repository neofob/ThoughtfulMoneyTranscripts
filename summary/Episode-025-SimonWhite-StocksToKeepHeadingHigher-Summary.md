### Summary

1. The global economy and financial markets are currently experiencing a
confusing period due to the pandemic's effects on different parts of the
economy operating out of sync. This has led to predictions of an imminent
recession not coming true.

2. Despite the Fed raising interest rates, debt service ratios have not risen
as much as expected because many people are on longer duration fixed-rate
mortgages and government spending is at a record high. However, this will
change over time as corporate net interest income starts to rise and effective
mortgage rates creep up.

3. Excess liquidity, which is the difference between real money growth and
economic growth, has been very favorable for risk assets. This year, there
was also a unique dynamic where central bank liquidity was supported by the
Treasury's actions, leading to a fiscal deficit on speed.

4. The Fed's recent decision to lower long-end yields could double down
on inflation risks as it has significantly increased them. Inflation will
return and last longer than many people think, causing alarm when it starts
to pick up again.

5. Liquidity conditions are currently very friendly for risk assets, but
there are concerns about something happening in credit markets that could
quickly take us into recessionary territory. The biggest accelerant of this
is credit spreads, which can feed back into the economy and cause a negative
feedback loop if they widen too much.
