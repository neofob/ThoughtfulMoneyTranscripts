### Summary

1. The January inflation rate rose higher than expected, causing concern
that the remaining inflation in the system is sticky and will prove harder
for the Federal Reserve to get under control. Some analysts have warned of
a repeat of the 1970s when the Fed had to raise interest rates up to 20%
to get prices under control.

2. Michael Leibowitz, portfolio manager at Real Investment Advice, believes
that the global economy is still coming in for a landing and it remains to
be seen whether this Goldilocks notion will come to fruition or if there
will be a hard or soft landing. He also notes that major economic powers
such as Japan, UK, Germany, and India are already in receession.

3. Leibowitz believes that the Fed's reaction function and consumer behavior
and psychology will play a role in determining whether there is a hard or
soft landing for the economy. He also mentions the lag effect of interest
rates on borrowing costs and the potential for layoffs as companies try to
preserve their profit margins.

4. Leibowitz discusses the market's reaction to Goldilocks, with high liquidity
driving animal spirits despite concerns about the lag effect. He notes that
there are still potential risks such as the expiration of stimulus programs
and the reverse repo program running dry.

5. The discussion also touches on the potential for a no landing or butterfly
soft landing scenario, where Wall Street expects everything to be fine until
the November presidential elections. However, Leibowitz notes that there are
still concerns about the lag effect and the possibility of black swans such
as interest rates rising unexpectedly.
