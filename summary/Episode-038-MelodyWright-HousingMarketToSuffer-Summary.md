### Summary

1. The US real estate market remains frozen with transactions at multi-decade
lows and mortgage rates remaining high. Home prices are near record levels
of unaffordability.

2. Melody Wright, a mortgage lending expert and housing analyst, has
been visiting popular housing markets to gain a true understanding of the
trends. She believes that there is still demand for homes but that it may
be impacted by factors such as inventory not listed on MLS and price drops
in oversaturated markets like Lakewood Ranch in Florida.

3. There have been recent rate drops, which could bring out more sellers
who think it's a good time to list their properties due to demand. However,
mortgage applications for both purchases and refinances are still down year
over year. Some analysts predict that bidding wars may be around the corner
and home price appreciation projections have been increased for 2024.

4. Melody believes that there is a lot of speculation in Florida's housing
market, with many second homes owned by international buyers and a large
number of new builds. She also notes that builder revenue and margins are
down despite high demand.

5. The narrative surrounding the housing market may be changing as some data
suggests that borrowers are saying no to prices rather than rates. This
could lead to true price discovery in certain markets, but it is unlikely
to result in a banner year for the overall housing market. Melody predicts
an aggregate decline in home prices by the end of 2024.

6. The most important thing about 2024 will be narrative and how it evolves
from the previous year's optimism. There may be challenges to this narrative
as inventory increases and demand decreases, particularly in Florida where
there has been a lot of speculation.
