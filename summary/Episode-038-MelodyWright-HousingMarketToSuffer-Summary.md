### Summary

The US real estate market remains frozen with transactions at
multi-decade lows and mortgage rates remaining high. Home prices are near
record levels of unaffordability. In 2024, the housing market is expected
to see some thawing due to a decrease in inventory and an increase in demand
from buyers who have been waiting for lower interest rates. However, overall,
it is not expected to be a banner year for the housing market with prices
ending the year down. The narrative of a housing recovery may prove false as
many homeowners are finding that they cannot afford current prices despite
lower mortgage rates. Additionally, there is concern about the impact of
institutional investors on the housing market and the potential for fraud
in non-owner occupied properties.
