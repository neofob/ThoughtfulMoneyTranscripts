### Summary

1. The definition of money is not as clear-cut as it may seem, with different
definitions and perspectives on what constitutes money.

2. The U.S. dollar has held up relatively well in recent years despite rapid
growth in debt and inflation, but its future performance is uncertain. Some
experts predict a more multipolar world with reserve diversification and the
use of alternative payment channels, while others see the dollar as the most
attractive horse in the glue factory.

3. The Federal Reserve's actions will play a role in the short-term performance
of the U.S. dollar, but market forces such as demand for dollars and liquidity
preferences may also be important factors.

4. Inflation is driven by both supply side shocks (such as disruptions to
the global supply chain) and demand side factors (such as expectations of
inflation). The Fed's actions are not necessarily the primary driver of
inflation, but they can contribute to it through their impact on liquidity
preferences and balance sheet capacity.

5. There is a risk of rececession in 2024 due to the ending of stealth stimulus
measures such as the employee retention credit and forbearance measures for
mortgage payments. Some experts believe that we are already in rececession,
while others see it as a possibility in the near future.

6. The future of money may involve a battle between top-down monies (such
as central bank digital currencies) and bottom-up monies (such as open
source protocols like Fediment). Some experts believe that the best money
has emerged naturally over time, rather than being imposed by authorities.
