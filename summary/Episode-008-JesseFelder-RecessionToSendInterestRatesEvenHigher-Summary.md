### Summary

1. The global economy and financial markets are currently priced for a
"soft landing" scenario, where the Fed has raised interest rates without
causing a recession or financial turmoil. However, there is potential for
disappointment as inflation may not come down sustainably to the Fed's target,
and the risk of a recession remains high due to lagging monetary tightening
effects and weak demand indicators from companies.

2. The post-COVID era has seen a sea change in the economy and financial
markets, with successful investors warning that what worked over the
past 15 years may not work for the next decade. This is due to shifts in
globalization, demographics, and debt dynamics, which have reversed course
from disinflationary forces to secular inflation trends.

3. Globalization has slowed down and even started to shrink as countries are
becoming more self-reliant and less dependent on supply chains that proved to
be efficient but unreliable. This trend towards deglobalization is a major
sea change that will have significant impacts on the cost of production,
inflation, and economic growth.

4. Demographics are also shifting as baby boomers retire and the workforce
shrinks relative to the overall population. This, combined with the risks
of offshoring labor and production, has created an inflationary dynamic that
is likely to persist for the long term.

5. Debt dynamics have also contributed to inflationary pressures, as the
wideening fiscal deficit creates a growing imbalance in the supply and
demand for treasuries. This, along with globalization and demographics,
suggests that the fight against inflation will be far from over.

6. The sea change has significant implications for investors, who need to
find investments that work in a different environment than what they have
been used to. This means looking beyond traditional asset classes such as
stocks and bonds and considering alternative assets such as commodities and
precious metals.
