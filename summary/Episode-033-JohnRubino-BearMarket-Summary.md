### Summary

1. The global economy and financial markets are facing stress fractures,
including recessionary leading indicators, struggling consumer households,
a frozen real estate market, breakdown of trade through the Red Sea, loss
of faith in once premier establishment brands like Harvard, and polarization
and cynicism in the US presidential election.

2. The most likely scenario for the future is either a cent or a breakdown,
with John Rubino predicting a dramaic slowdown in consumer spending next
year due to excess savings being spent and credit card debt rising at record
levels with high interest rates. This will lead to lower corporate profits
and an equities bear market.

3. The US labor market is not as robust as it appears, with the unemployment
rate low but many people holding two full-time jobs or working part-time due
to lack of full-time opportunities. Four out of 10 companies are planning
layoffs in the year ahead.

4. The global economy is facing a debt crisis, with debt going parabolic and
central banks unable to raise interest rates without causing a deflationary
collapse. This will lead to negative interest rates and another round of
quantitative easing, which will cause inflation and potentially a currency
crisis.

5. Investors should consider buying real assets such as gold and silver miner
stocks, royalty companies in the gold and silver space, uranium mining stocks,
and short candidates in overvalued equities markets. They should also focus
on building resilience through acquiring new skills such as growing their
own food, doing home repairs, learning to use firearms safely, and physically
defending themselves.
