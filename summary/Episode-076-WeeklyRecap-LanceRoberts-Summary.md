### Summary

1. The first quarter of 2023 was a strong period for the markets, with
everything from dollar milkshakes to stocks and bonds going up. This rally
was predicted by several experts in Q4 2022.
2. Lancé Roberts attributes this rally to buybacks, extremely negative
sentiment, and a reversal of negativity that occurred over the summer. He
also notes that there is no surprise in this as it was expected due to strong
quarterly performance.
3. The market has been experiencing extreme bullish sentiment, with everything
moving into the more overbought and momentum-driven quadrants. This is a
result of so much money flowing into the market that it needs to go somewhere.
4. Lancé Roberts notes that this is not surprising as markets work based
on supply and demand. He compares it to a crowded theater where everyone is
trying to transact business, but at some point, someone will want to sell,
causing others to follow suit and leading to a correction.
5. The market has been experiencing five months or more of gains in a row,
which historically occurs only 25% of the time. This indicates that the market
is getting long in the tooth and may be due for a correction soon. However,
this does not necessarily mean a big crash but rather a month where the
market cools off.
6. Lancé Roberts notes that there are no real resistance levels until TLT
gets above 100, indicating that bonds have been doing well since October
lows and could see a decent rally if the Fed cuts rates in June or July.
7. Gold has finally broken out to new highs, leading some to wonder if this is
the moment for gold to rocket to new heights after years of trying. However,
Lancé Roberts notes that gold's price is driven by whatever people want to
make it a bet on and does not have fundamental value.
8. The market loves momentum, so if gold starts moving, investors will chase
it. However, this could also lead to a late-stage move as historical data
shows that five months or more of gains in the markets typically leads to a 5%
to 10% correction.
9. Lancé Roberts advises taking profits and putting in a hedge if gold is
part of one's portfolio, as correlation between asset classes has become
so high that they all move together. This increases risk in portfolios and
requires more focus on managing volatility risk.
10. The market is currently experiencing a late-stage move, with everything
going to the moon and no real resistance until TLT gets above 100. However,
this could also indicate that a correction is due soon as markets cannot go
straight up forever.
