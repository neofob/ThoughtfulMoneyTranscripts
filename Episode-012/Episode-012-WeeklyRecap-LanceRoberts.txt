 the federal reserve's got a
 meeting coming up very shortly. The one
 thing when we talk about liquidity, their
 financial conditions or market liquidity,
 that is inflationary in nature and this
 is going to be a concern for the Fed.
 Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm the
 founder and your host, Adam Taggart,
 welcoming you here at the end of another
 week, a week that caps a pretty good
 month of November. I'm joined as usual
 by my emotionally sensitive friend,
 Lance Roberts, who apparently just
 discovered that people can be mean on
 Twitter. How you doing, Lance?
 I'm good and I'm never going to use to
 call it an X, so it's just going to
 remain Twitter.
 X just does not come off the tongue
 easily.
 It seems like it would, considering it's
 just one letter.
 I know, you would think so, but yeah, for
 some reason it's just, I don't know,
 war there and I don't know why he's
 trying to remove a brand that we can't
 stop saying, but anyway,
 his prerogative but our prerogative to
 still say Twitter. As I mentioned,
 Lance,
 a mildly up week
 for the markets this week but closing
 out November, pretty amazing month for
 the markets. If I've got my data
 correct here,
 global bond and stocks added over 11
 trillion in market cap this month, the
 second biggest monthly gain in history.
 Yep.
 And let's see, global bonds. The only
 time it was a bigger gain in November
 was in November 2020.
 We were getting the stimulus
 checks and all that was starting to hit
 the markets and the Fed was doing 1.2
 trillion a month or 120 billion a
 month in QE and then of course we
 launched off into 2021 which was just a
 non-stop up gear
 for the markets. Yes, so the best
 month since
 back then when the Fed was just doing a
 gargantuan,
 completely historically unprecedented
 amount of liquidity.
 I am going to get to some data in a
 little bit about liquidity
 which may be contributing somewhat to
 this surge although it looks like the
 impulse for that liquidity is now ending
 and we can talk about that in a bit
 but let me just mention too that not
 only did the entire market do really
 well but the bond market did especially
 well.
 It had its best month since December
 globally since December 2008
 and for the US, US bonds soared to their
 best month since May 1985, so
 I want to give you a chance here, Lance,
 to take a bit of a victory lap. I was
 kind of holding you back the last time
 we talked but
 you were out there telling
 folks, "Look, I'm still in
 the bond trade here. I'm still holding on
 to most of my TLTs." In fact, you were
 buying a bunch more for your personal
 account over the past couple of months.
 Obviously, that has worked out pretty
 well in the short term here at least.
 Yeah, and again,
 just to backtrack a bit,
 we actually sold TLT,
 previously bought EDV because we wanted
 to extend our duration,
 so we did a tax law sell back in October,
 swapped our duration out longer in EDV
 and as I noted, I had overweighted that
 position a bit and so
 probably about mid-November-ish, I guess.
 I have to go back and look at the exact
 date. I took a little piece of that
 trading position off but still hold the
 long position because
 the upside is, I mean, you take a look at
 a long-term chart of interest rates, you
 can't even see this recent move down,
 which we got below 4.3% on yields
 this week. We're kind of flipping
 back and forth here a little bit but
 yields are very overbought
 here, so if you're long the bond trade,
 take some profits here, you're going to
 get a tick up in rates.
 We're going to go from overbought
 on bonds to over, you know, back to
 oversold on bonds, just like the market
 does,
 and if you haven't put
 on a trade yet, you're looking for an
 opportunity, don't do so. You're going to
 get a better opportunity and I suspect, I
 guess we'll talk about this some more
 when you talk about liquidity but, you
 know, the Federal Reserve's got a meeting
 coming up very shortly.
 The one thing when, you know, we talk
 about liquidity, their financial
 conditions or market liquidity,
 that is inflationary in nature and this
 is going to be a concern for the Fed.
 The one thing that Journal-Powell noted
 at the last FOMC meeting
 was that the bond market and the stock
 market because of October,
 yields were rising sharply, we were at 5%,
 stock market was down sharply,
 people were convinced the, you know, the
 bear market was back and,
 you know, we're getting the most
 bearish narratives out of people and,
 you know, bears were running around
 claiming victory laps in October and we
 warned you then that,
 you know, that extreme bearishness was
 going to reverse and
 but the problem with that reversal is
 that it loosens monetary conditions
 which gives people, and we saw this
 recently, we saw an uptick in consumer
 confidence.
 If consumers become more confident, they
 go out and they spend money and this is
 exactly what Ben Bernanke said back in
 2010,
 when he did in September, when he did the
 second round of quantitative easing, he
 said the reason we're doing QE
 is to lift asset prices in order to
 boost consumer confidence which will
 then feed into economic growth. So if
 anybody ever tells you that QE does not
 boost asset markets, just quote Ben
 Bernanke to them because that's exactly
 what they're doing. And that's the whole
 wealth effect, I mean, in practice, right?
 Yeah, exactly. And so my concern now
 short term is, and I'm actually kind of
 rooting for this, is I want the Fed to
 come out and be a bit more hawkish.
 You know, everybody's expecting the Fed
 to not only pause at this next meeting
 on, I think it's December 13th, don't quote
 me on the date, I think
 it's mid-month, but I think it's the
 13th. And to be clear, to remain paused,
 but yes. Yeah, and they're going to, and
 yeah, everybody's wanting to make a
 statement like, "Oh, everything's fine
 and we don't need to do any more,"
 kind of in that language, and I don't
 think the Fed -- A, I don't think the Fed's
 going to do that, and I'm kind of hoping
 they don't. I hope they come out and say,
 "We're still concerned about inflation,
 we still have one rate hike left on the
 table, kind of in our back pocket if we
 need to use it,
 to pull some of this froth back out of
 the market a bit,
 because the markets are getting too far
 ahead of themselves relative to what the
 Fed's actually going to do. So we need a
 little bit of a breather here to work
 off some of these overbought conditions.
 That'll give you a better entry point to
 either buy bonds or buy stocks as well.
 Okay, so the Fed -- I just want to
 go back to something you said a couple
 of weeks ago.
 I want to make sure that you still
 believe the Fed isn't actually going to
 hike again,
 start to rally on expectations the Fed
 was going to turn around and start
 cutting rates or do something, and then
 the Fed would -- and then so the market
 would rally up sharply,
 and then the Fed would come out of
 meetings like, "Nope, we're still fighting
 inflation." Then the market would sell
 off again,
 and then it would rally back up and it
 would get to a point the Fed would come
 out saying,
 "No, we're not going to cut rates anytime soon,"
 and it would sell off again. And that was
 that repeated process
 all through 2022. And, you know,
 and what the markets keep doing is
 working against what the Fed's trying to
 achieve. The Fed wants
 lower market values. They want higher
 interest rates near term to
 slow consumer spending so they can bring
 down inflation, get inflation back under
 control. They want it below two percent
 or less.
 And the markets keep doing exactly the
 opposite
 of what the Fed wants, which is
 unfortunately going to have to, you know,
 look, just my opinion,
 I could be entirely wrong about this, but
 I have to assume if I'm Jerome Powell
 that
 the rather sharp drop in
 interest rates -- which we've already seen
 mortgage rates coming down, we've already
 seen an uptick in consumer confidence,
 we're seeing an uptick in economic data,
 leading in the year, the
 six-month rate of change in leading
 economic indicators have turned up.
 You're starting to see this flow
 back into the markets in just a very
 short period and that's got to be
 concerning to the Fed
 who is worried about a resurgence of
 inflation going into next year.
 What's so interesting because
 that has been the
 dynamic for the entire
 year where
 the Fed has said, "I'm going to be higher
 but it hasn't mattered for the price of
 the indices," and of course that's
 basically the mag seven, you know,
 pulling everything up,
 but if you're just looking at the
 indices it's been so interesting that the
 market has been
 wrong every time
 about the Fed's timing for a pivot and
 yet it hasn't mattered to stocks.
 Obviously the big question is will it at
 some point? We'll get there.
 I do though, and that's why I'm talking
 here, maybe if you can pull up
 your weekly chart of the S&P here
 because I want to get into some of that
 data in a sec,
 but again in addition to giving you a
 bit of a victory lap on TLT, I want to
 continue to give one to you on
 your call
 a month ago that, "Hey, I think
 that stocks are going to more than
 likely than not end the year higher, maybe
 even at an all-time high for the year,"
 and
 the rally has continued. This
 week it's somewhat plateaued even
 though we are a bit higher than we were
 when we started the week.
 First question for you is
 is your call still for a short-term
 pullback in the market because of its
 current overbought conditions
 and then about
 sometime in mid-December into the
 end of the year?
 Well, so
 as you can see on this chart that
 I'm sharing with you now, there's three
 blue arrows that point down, not up.
 Kind of answers my question
 right there visually. Thank you.
 Yeah, but the important thing here
 is, and again,
 this isn't saying that a bear
 market -- and this is always interesting
 because I do a weekly thing with
 Fox Business News with Charles Payne,
 and it's always very -- because he's
 always very bullish --
 and if I say anything about a short-term
 correction or a consolidation, he's like,
 "Well, you're bearish on stocks?
 You know, I thought you like stocks. Why
 are you bearish?" And I'm like, "No, I'm not
 bearish. It's just that things can't move
 up indefinitely. You've got to have these
 pullbacks along the way."
 And we've used the rubber band
 analogy before, and it's just a great
 analogy of this. If I stretch a rubber
 band,
 there's a point I can't stretch it
 any further.
 Either the rubber band is going to break
 or I'm just not strong enough to stretch
 it any further.
 So in order to stretch it again, I've got
 to relax it and then stretch it, right? So
 the markets work exactly the same way.
 When markets rally,
 we exhaust the buyers. Everybody that was
 wanting to buy at the bottom of October
 has now bought.
 Sellers who were all willing to sell in
 October
 no longer want to sell. They're like, "Hey,
 the market's going up. I don't want to
 sell here. The market's going to keep
 going up. So why would I want to sell?" So
 you simply just run out of buyers and
 sellers at a point.
 And then what happens is that markets
 start to kind of work themselves around
 a bit and sellers go, "Well, maybe we're
 not going to go up any further
 or there's a piece of news or whatever
 it is." And somebody says, "Okay, I'll sell
 here." And then that starts the whole
 process to the downside. So you get this
 kind of correctional process.
 But if we look at that, if we look at a
 chart of the market, first of all, this
 bottom,
 this bottom graph is just a basic
 relative strength index. All it just
 kind of just tells you
 what the market's doing. And we're back
 to levels that historically have
 coincided with at least
 a short-term market peak, if not a bigger
 peak. You know, last time we were kind
 of this overbought was, you know, June,
 July.
 And this is what we were talking about
 in June, July. We said, "Hey,
 be ready. We're probably going to get a
 five to ten percent correction this
 summer because we've had such a big
 run-up in the markets and we're so
 overbought here,
 you're going to get a five to ten percent
 correction." Well, that declined from the
 peak of the market to the October lows
 was ten point three percent. So, it was
 right in that ten percent
 range of that normal annual decline.
 And of course, and as I told you back
 then, I said, "Adam, when this decline
 occurs, everybody's gonna be super
 bearish. Everybody's gonna be convinced
 the bear market's back
 and we're gonna have super negative
 sentiment and the economy's falling
 apart and recession's right around the
 corner.
 That's not going to be the case. It's
 just correcting
 this major run that we had going from
 February to July. So,
 you know, that was all very part of a
 normal correctional process. Well, here we
 are again,
 very overbought. So, if we just use a
 Fibonacci retracement sequence of the
 rally,
 you know, pull back to, you know, the
 23.6 percent retracement,
 it'll put you right back at the bottom
 of that gap up
 that we had, you know, in mid-November.
 They kind of really, where this rally
 really just kind of got a life of its
 own.
 But gap ups, and if you talk to
 Sven Heinrich about this, he'll tell you
 this as well, gaps
 are like gravity and they want to be
 filled.
 And so gaps tend to act, I shouldn't
 say gravity, more like a magnet. And
 so they want to pull prices through
 that gap up
 that normally occurs. And so that'd be a
 38 percent retracement of that rally.
 That put us right back around 4400. Still
 that, and that would be great,
 right? We'd get back to a level that
 would have the markets back to oversold
 conditions.
 You'd be sitting at, you know, that
 previous gap breakout, right? So we filled
 that gap and now we're
 in a good position. And about
 the time that we get to 4400,
 the 50-day moving average is going to be
 sitting right at that level.
 So you'll have the 50-day
 moving average support right around
 4400 when we
 get there. Now, you know, a 50 percent
 retracement of a rally is completely
 normal.
 And so you should expect that as well. If
 we get some really hawkish news from the
 Fed, a 50 percent retracement of the
 rally would certainly not be,
 you know, out of the realm of ordinary.
 That would give you a really good
 opportunity. Markets are going to be
 pretty deeply oversold at that point.
 And you're going to have a good
 opportunity to basically put some money
 to work for that
 traditional kind of year-end Santa
 Claus rally, first five days of January
 as pension funds, mutual funds, et cetera,
 all put their money back
 into the markets. So again, that kind of
 gives you some ranges to work with. I
 have no idea,
 you know, what will actually turn out to
 be the case. We'll just have to navigate
 that
 because a lot of it will depend on what
 kind of news flow do we get, what kind of
 economic data do we get, what is the,
 mostly what the Fed says.
 The employment report will have a lot to
 do with that. If we have a really strong
 employment report, that's going to pull
 the market down.
 If we have a strong inflationary report
 for some reason, don't really see it
 right now, the data doesn't support it.
 But if we
 happen to have a pop-up in CPI, that can
 pull the data down. Again,
 a strong, you know, more hawkish message
 from the Fed could certainly do the trick.
 So the risk there is a correction. There
 is another
 solution to this, which is that the
 market just does nothing for the next
 three weeks. That's what I was going to ask.
 And just goes sideways for three weeks
 and works off some. And again, what
 you're looking for is just a reversal of
 this RSI index. You're just looking for
 that some of that overbought condition
 to get reversed and the market just
 going sideways can do exactly that same
 thing. So a correction, sideways action,
 you know, likely, you know,
 the most likely outcome here. I doubt we
 see
 this kind of rally just continue higher.
 We haven't gone anywhere, basically, in
 the market for the last three, four, five,
 six, seven, eight, nine trading days. We've
 just kind of been going sideways for
 over a week now. So again, that's just
 kind of what the market does when it
 does this. Volume has been declining on
 this rally. If I'm long equities right
 now, in the last month of December, this
 is a great time to do tax loss harvesting.
 Sell your losers, take them off the table
 in 31 days, you can buy them back.
 Take profits and stuff that has had that's
 really overbought, that's had a big run
 up, a great time to take some of those
 capital gains, offset them against your
 losses, kind of, you know, manage some of
 your tax risk that way as well. That's
 what we've been doing over the last
 couple of weeks. We just finished up the
 last of our tax loss harvesting today in
 our ETF model. So, you know, this is a
 great time to take advantage of this
 rally to rebalance risk in your
 portfolio and get yourself prepared
 for next year.
 Okay, a couple of questions related to
 43-25 and then in the mid-4200s.
 What's the risk of those
 pulling, you know, the magnet down to fill
 those?
 It's certainly possible. Look, you know,
 markets, you know, back in July, nobody
 thought the market was going to correct
 10%, right? You know, so there's
 certainly a possibility but you're going
 to need some type of,
 you know, catalyst to make that occur
 because what you've got to do is now
 you've got to break this bullish
 sentiment that we've got going on in the
 market. So, the markets are not -- we are
 getting more of the greed factor back
 into the market. If you take a look at
 professional sentiment, take a look at
 retail investor sentiment,
 it's getting very bullish but it's not
 extremely bullish yet. So, there's still
 some room left to get everybody
 into the pool, so to speak.
 So, that's why there's a bit more
 support to the markets. Also, you just
 have the seasonal, you know, biases of the
 markets right now that the portfolio
 window dressing for year-end, the first
 five days of January, which is where
 everybody's got to put their money to
 work for the year. So, there's some biases
 that are going to support the markets
 near term. However, if you get some type
 of really, really bad economic --
 we're through earnings right now, too, so
 we don't have any earnings to deal with
 until we get into January. So, there's
 really nothing here to drag the market
 substantially down unless the Fed comes
 out and shocked the market and actually
 hiked rates on the 13th. That would
 probably do the trick. So, there probably,
 yeah, some unexpected catalysts like
 that. I guess, too, technically,
 as the market begins to go
 down and try to close those gaps, it hits
 the moving averages and those
 begin to act as resistance, too, right?
 Support, yeah, they do. Yeah, I'm sorry,
 resistance to going down further or
 IE support, yeah. Okay, so two things.
 Let's stop the sharing here, but
 I want to give you -- I'm not going to
 share with you anymore. Yeah, no,
 because I want you to.
 So, as you said,
 if the market just kind of grinds
 sideways, that's actually net bullish
 because it takes the pressure
 off the overbought readings as more time
 goes on there, right? But I
 still believe, and correct me if I'm
 wrong, I still believe your base case is
 that we are going to see the market go
 down because of the still overbought
 nature of things before it probably
 powers into the end of the year.
 You recently wrote
 an article called "Stock Market Correction
 Coming Before the Santa Claus Rally" and
 you have a couple of charts in there and
 I'm just curious, do you want to go
 through any of those here while we're
 talking about this topic?
 Sure. I mean, we can. I mean, let me
 pull that article up here real quick.
 It's pretty much the same thing that we
 just kind of discussed,
 but just the reality is that
 markets -- it is possible for the
 market to just consolidate sideways and
 that is something that can
 happen. It's not usually the case.
 Normally markets go through a
 correctional pullback of some sort.
 Let me -- okay, I've got this up here. Let me
 do one thing and then I'll share my
 screen.
 And there's a couple of reasons for kind
 of talking about this kind of
 pullback scenario. Where'd you go?
 So this is just a chart from
 equityclock.com. It's just a seasonality
 chart of the markets and kind of what
 happens from month to month. It's just an
 average of all years.
 And what you'll notice is that in
 early December you typically have a
 little spike up in the market
 and then what we were talking about
 specifically in that article
 is you have all your mutual fund
 distributions. Those tend to occur in the
 first two to three weeks
 of December, particularly the second
 week and third week of December you
 typically get these distributions. So you
 normally have this bit of a pullback in
 the market, not uncommon at all.
 That's what we're talking about here is
 just when that selling hits the market
 because these mutual funds have to
 distribute capital gains, dividends, and
 interest for the year,
 that's going to be some selling pressure
 for the market and that's what
 gives you that bit of a pullback. Once
 that's over then they have to turn
 around and start buying again to get
 their portfolios dressed for the end of
 your reporting. They can't be holding
 too much cash. They've got to have all
 the right positions and that's why you
 get that traditional Santa
 Claus rally. It's because of that window
 dressing that tends to occur.
 As you're moving from that chart I just
 want to give Sven Henrik a quick shout
 out because when I had him on several
 months ago he pulled up that chart and
 just said, "Hey, look, I'm not saying this
 now that we're here in the last inning or
 so, it still seems to be playing out this
 way." So for whatever reason this year
 has been very, very typical from a
 seasonality standpoint. Yeah, I know if
 you take a full year look at the S&P 500
 it looks very much like this chart and
 you see here is the peak in June.
 We peaked in July. This one peaks in
 June. Then you have your sell-off into
 October. Market bottoms in October. We
 bought them late October. And then you
 had this rally that started in November.
 And so again, this is your
 rally at the beginning of the year.
 February, March, April, May, June, the market
 was up 17%. So the arc, as you
 said, of the market this year varies.
 Here it is again. You can see it right
 here. Here's that same arc of performance
 that you've had all year long. So you get
 a bit of a pullback here. And again, this
 is where I was noting, volume's
 been drying up while markets have been
 advancing. That's a negative divergence.
 And that's just that buyers are running
 out of buying power and sellers are
 going and if buyers are running out of
 buying power and they bought all they
 want to buy and the mutual funds have to
 distribute, as an example, that's that
 additional selling pressure that the
 market can't absorb. And that's why you
 get that bit of a correction in the
 short term. So, you know, again, it's just
 and this is where we looked at, you know,
 areas where volume exists and where
 buyers are most likely going to show up.
 And this is what I was talking about,
 that gap where that we have in the
 market and why that will probably act
 like a magnet if we get some type of
 correction, because there's not a lot of
 buyers that were in that gap. They all
 existed right around the 50-day moving
 average. So that was where the big bulk
 of your buyers was. There's a bit of
 buying here at this previous, this chart's
 a little bit dated. This was Friday of
 last week. We've had a little bit more
 action since then. But there's some
 buying volume that exists right here
 around $449-ish on SPY, as an example.
 But below that, it's mostly around that
 50-day moving average. So that's why I'm
 saying that 50-day moving average around
 $4,400 seems to be a pretty likely target
 if we get into a more substantial-ish
 type correction. And again, just kind of
 going through the technicals, whenever
 the market has been this overbought,
 you've got your MACD overbought, you've
 got Citastix overbought, you've got your
 RSI is very overbought, you've almost
 always had some type of corrective action
 that followed. It's just kind of, but it
 can take time. It doesn't mean, and just
 because it doesn't happen today or
 tomorrow, next week, doesn't mean it
 won't. And back in, remember, back in June
 July, we were saying, hey, expect a 5-10%
 correction. It took about a month before
 the correction started and everybody's
 like, oh, Lance is wrong. There's not
 going to be a correction. Then you had
 10% correction, you know, August,
 September, October. It's just, this,
 it's not predicting. It's just saying,
 look, this is what happens when you
 stretch the rubber band. It's got to
 contract in some manner. Stock prices
 just don't go up in that indefinitely.
 And they don't. And remember in October,
 everybody was convinced that stock
 prices were only going to go down. They
 don't do that. That's not the way
 markets work. So the best thing you can
 do as an investor is learn the rhythm of
 the market so that you can navigate
 these ads and flows and you'll wind up
 buying high and selling low.
 Alright, so let's assume for a second
 that you're going to be correct and that
 there is going to be an end of year
 buying surge as all the big funds
 rebalance and window dress and all that
 stuff, right? Does that imply then the
 longer it takes for this correction, the
 short-term correction to show up? Does
 that mean the longer it takes to show up
 it's going to be more short and violent
 when it happens? Because if it's going to
 happen before that surge,
 you're running out of time to get the
 froth out of the market.
 Well, that's where this gets a little
 bit interesting because, first of all, let
 me just back up. There is absolutely no
 guarantee that we'll get a Santa Claus
 rally this year. There are years that
 it doesn't happen. 2018 is a really good
 example. We did not get a Santa Claus
 rally in 2018. In fact, the markets were
 down 20% between September and December.
 Now, there was stuff going on there with
 the Federal Reserve and the Fed was, you
 know, back then the Fed was saying, "Hey,
 we're nowhere near the mutual rate.
 Markets are going down because the
 markets are freaking out that the Fed's
 going to keep hiking rates." And, you know,
 this is all coming to a very quick end.
 So, first of all, there's no
 guarantee that it'll go up. All we're
 saying is that the historical odds are
 that you're going to have this year-end
 buying occur, but not before you have
 some type of correction because that's
 what markets normally do. Again, normally
 being the key word doesn't mean it has
 to happen. So, don't take this to the
 bank saying, "Oh, well, Lance said this
 and, you know, he's either going to be
 right or wrong." I'm just saying, look,
 statistically speaking, we have to play
 possibilities and probabilities. The
 probabilities are correction first of
 some sort, consolidation correction, and
 then a rally into year-end. We may wind
 up exactly where we are right now, you
 know, after a correction, the market
 rallies, we have the Santa Claus rally,
 and we're right back to where we are
 right now. And that's because we had such
 a big rally in November. If you go back
 through history, whenever you've had
 these big eight, nine, ten percent
 November months, which have occurred
 previously, December isn't that strong
 of a rally. Why? Because you've already
 pulled in all that buying into the
 market. So, you may be, and I'm not saying
 do this, but you could theoretically
 probably sell here everything and then
 buy January the 1st and you're going to
 be right where it'll be the same outcome,
 potentially.
 Okay, so may be a good time to do your
 tax law selling because if there's not
 going to be that much of a lift this
 year, sell now, avoid whatever potential
 short-term correction might be coming,
 and by the time the new year gets here
 you're able to buy back and everything
 without the wash rule.
 Correct, absolutely right.
 Okay, well look,
 I asked folks on Twitter for
 questions that they might want to toss
 into the discussion today and I've
 been trying to slip them in as I can,
 but you touched on two of them that I
 want to just talk about for a moment.
 So, we've talked a lot today about
 seasonality and what usually happens at
 that everybody knows about.
 Why do they still persist? Shouldn't
 they basically be already priced in?
 Well, normally, but again there's
 certain things that occur every year
 that the markets do know about, so they
 invest based on those issues. So
 everybody knows about seasonality, so
 everybody kind of buys November and
 December. It's just we know that,
 seasonally strong period of the year,
 worse performances. Does that mean it
 almost becomes a self-fulfilling
 prophecy where I know markets go up so
 I'm going to buy into the beginning to
 ride it and because so many people are
 buying into the beginning to ride it, it
 actually causes the takeoff?
 Yeah, absolutely, and the other
 side of it is is that you also have some
 effects that are going on that we talked
 about in October, which said,
 "Look, when you get to --" we wrote an
 article in, I think it was late September,
 I have to go pull it up now, but
 we said weakness in October before the
 year-end rally, and the reason for the
 year-end rally was you get through
 earnings season, then the blackout window
 opens up for stock buybacks. We've had a
 near record amount of stock buybacks in
 the last month, just a gorge of
 corporations buying back their own
 shares. Insider buying, corporate
 executives have been buying shares hand
 over fist because that blackout window
 opened back up. So that starts the market
 rally and then when the market starts to
 rally, everybody that was convinced it
 was a bear market and they're super
 bearish, they go, "Oh my gosh, I'm missing
 it." Then they jump in, that then drives
 the market higher and you get this
 effect. Then every year we get mutual
 fund distributions, then you have the
 portfolio window dressing for hedge
 funds, mutual funds, pension funds, those
 are your big money. Those are not your
 big money, right? It's not retail
 investors. They're the ones that are
 driving the year-end performance because
 they're balancing their positions for
 the end of the year reporting.
 Yeah, it's interesting. I totally get
 what you're saying there. I'm also
 thinking smart institutional
 investors with
 supercomputer AI quant algorithms
 could price in what should happen when
 the rebalancing happens and therefore
 drive prices up beforehand where
 you wouldn't notice but obviously it
 happens.
 There's certainly some
 arbitrage that goes on and don't
 mistake that at all because that
 certainly does occur.
 But it's certainly not smoothing out the
 seasonal patterns. They still
 happen for the most part.
 The other question which you touched on
 and maybe you've already fully answered
 it but was, "Hey, it is now December
 and so are there year-end
 strategies tasks that
 the prudent conscientious
 investor should be considering here at
 the end of the year?" Obviously you
 already talked about tax loss
 harvesting. Is there anything else beyond
 that that you would recommend?
 If you don't have an IRA open you have
 to open it before year-end for next
 filing season. So it has to be
 opened before December 31st. So if
 you've never opened an IRA before
 you need to open one before
 year-end and that way you'll have it for
 next year.
 Sorry to interrupt but when's the
 deadline to
 fund it? Tax filing.
 Okay, so you have to open it before the
 end of this year but if you want to
 contribute for 2023 you have up until
 right before you file your taxes next
 year.
 But it has to be opened.
 So one thing that drives me crazy
 every year we tell our our clients as
 well in advance who's like, "Look,
 we get the last week of the year off to
 all of our employees so if you need to
 do something for the year tax year
 get it done now because there's not
 anybody around."
 Everybody waits until the last minute to
 try to do this stuff and what's going to
 happen is is that whether you're trying
 to do it through yourself or through a
 brokerage firm whatever
 you know you're just going to make
 you're just going to make things really
 difficult for yourself. So do all
 your year-end
 stuff, you know, do your tax law selling,
 you know, take your capital
 gains that you need to take,
 take your RMD payments, calculate
 those, get those out of your account.
 Do it early. Do a favor to your advisor
 and don't wait till the last minute but
 also
 getting it done in advance is going
 to help you
 because everybody else is
 going to wait till the last minute and
 you're going to have a lot of time,
 you know, a lot of difficulty trying to
 reach help, get somebody to return a
 phone call, etc., because everybody's going
 to be swamped trying to take care of this
 stuff everybody.
 So act now.
 I guess on this question too, so we talk
 a lot about the importance of
 having a financial plan and
 we talked a lot last week about
 measuring your progress
 versus the plan not by some arbitrary
 January 1st date.
 I think I know what your answer is going
 to be here but is it better
 to start the new year fresh by
 making your plan at the start of the
 year or
 blowing the dust off last year's
 plan on January 1st and setting up for
 the year or is it better to do it in
 December so that you can hit January 1st
 running? Yeah, if you don't have a plan,
 first of all, if you don't have a
 financial plan,
 build one, right? And, you know, very
 important to those things is
 don't you, if you use some type of
 calculator that uses a stagnant rate of
 return like,
 okay, you want to retire in 30 years, you
 know, put in your rate of return,
 eight percent a year, whatever it is, if
 that's the first question to ask you,
 throw it out the window because it's
 completely useless.
 Any financial plan built on a stagnant
 rate of returns,
 throw it out the window, it's completely
 useless. And how do you know that?
 Because November 30th the market
 ended at exactly the same price it was
 November 30th
 two years ago. In other words, the market
 has done, had zero rate of returns for
 two years
 and the markets are still not back to
 even. So you're still trying to make up
 losses, you're not making gains. So now if
 your plan is based on eight percent a
 year,
 you've not only got to make up the eight
 percent from the first year
 and the eight percent from the second
 year, you've also got to make up the
 eight percent in the coming year.
 So you've got to have just massive gains
 to try to make up
 those previous losses. And this is so
 that completely blows plans,
 you know, market declines completely
 blow these plans out of water.
 And that's why like all these things
 like the fire movement die, the
 smoldering death because,
 you know, as soon as you have a market
 downturn, all these plans based on eight
 percent returns go right out the window.
 So your plan needs to be adjusted for
 variable rates of return. Those variable
 rates of return need to be based on
 valuation levels.
 They also need to include inflation,
 a variable rate of inflation over
 time. You need to assume for both
 periods of higher inflation, lower
 inflation. You need to
 adjust your withdrawal rate during
 market decline. So if
 the market does decline, have a plan
 built in there for taking out less money
 from your assets
 during those periods. That's what a
 really good financial plan will do for
 you. That's, you know, that's what Richard
 and Danny do. They've spent years
 developing, you know, these type of
 structures, but it's just common
 sense that you've got to build in
 for these periods of time where you
 don't have a market return or heaven
 forbid, you have a 50% decline in the
 market at some point.
 So let me ask you about that. First off,
 the plans that I've used,
 what I like about them is they do
 Monte Carlo simulation,
 right? So you basically have your
 goals and whatnot and then they do, you
 know, Monte Carlo basically is, it just
 runs a
 tremendous amount of
 probabilities or calculations
 making all sorts of different assumptions
 for market returns, for inflation,
 whatever and they basically tell you,
 "Okay, after running thousands of
 sensitivities on your plan, you have a 98%
 chance of hitting your goal or you have
 a 21% chance of hitting your right," and it
 gives you a good sense as to how
 vulnerable you are to a lot of these
 changes because nobody knows what's
 going to happen in the future with
 these variables. So what you want to
 do is you want to test a whole bunch of
 them and see how you come out on each
 one of those
 war game trials.
 You've got to be careful with those
 because a lot of plans, what they'll do
 is you'll see this graph. It'll have
 all these lines on it, right, then like
 light gray, whatever. So those are all the
 tests and then there's this one dark
 line
 that is the average of all those
 simulations and that's what they're
 basing your rate of return on
 saying, "Oh, your success rate's based on
 this average of all these potential
 outcomes."
 That's not the way it works, right? That's
 the same thing as using an eight percent
 rate of return over time because you're
 trying to average
 how markets react. The problem with that
 is that you're looking over a period of
 time of 50 or 100 years over the last
 100 years.
 Let's back this up for a quick second.
 Where does the idea come from that
 markets return eight percent on average
 every year?
 Easy. I go back to 1900, I average every
 rate of return year going forward,
 add in dividends, subtract out inflation,
 I get eight percent.
 Now, that's all fine and dandy. Markets
 don't do that every single year. You don't
 get eight percent a year. Some years you get
 20, some years you get negative 10.
 It's the down years. It's not the average,
 it's the down years that have the biggest
 impact to your financial plan. So
 any plan that uses Monte Carlo
 simulations, average rate of returns,
 throw it out the window. You've got to
 build a structure that says, hey,
 over the next 20 years, I'm going to
 build in a bear market over the next two
 years. I'm going to assume the market's
 going to be down
 30 percent in 2024, 2025.
 I'm going to have three up years after
 that and I'm going to have another down
 year in 2029
 and my retirement date's 2030, whatever
 it is. Then see how your plan turns out.
 See how your risk tolerances turn out.
 See how the survivability of your plan
 turns out.
 Then you've got to adjust your withdrawal
 rates for those periods where markets
 are declining because I can't take out
 market, I can't take out assets.
 If the market's down 10 and I'm taking
 out four,
 I'm down 14. I've dramatically
 increased that downside risk in my
 portfolio. So you've got to extract
 periods of time saying, hey, I've got to
 have a cash buffer. This is what Richard
 and Danny talk about,
 having this emergency fund set
 aside for those years
 because you can't touch your assets in a
 down year. You've got to draw from this
 emergency fund
 during that down year. That's how you
 survive and win the long-term game.
 All these other plans that are based on
 Monte Carlo's, they're not worth the
 paper they're written on in most cases.
 I want to defend Monte Carlo a
 little bit in a second but I want to
 underscore your main point here which is
 about the importance of risk management
 and risk mitigation and that hopefully
 I've beaten that drum
 to death over the past couple of years
 of folks who've watched me on this
 channel but this is where
 cash
 buffers and hedges and all that
 stuff really come into play because to
 your point I totally agree with which is
 limiting your downside
 is the best way to maximize your ability
 to hit your goals going forward.
 What I do with the Monte Carlo's is
 they show you the lines.
 Each
 sensitivity that they run is
 its own line. I look to see
 how many of those lines fall
 below my goal?
 That's the right way to use it.
 That's the right way to use it, yes.
 Because there's no guarantees.
 There are going to be some scenarios
 where I don't hit my goals because the
 market crashes every year for the next 50 years.
 Of course I'm not going to make my goals
 then but as long as I'm like 98%
 certain, that's where I begin to be
 like, "Okay, I feel like I'm in good
 territory." But that's a huge difference.
 to what we were talking about.
 So if I run Monte Carlo's, which we do
 that too,
 but what we're looking for is we say,
 "Okay, here's my Monte Carlo rate of
 return
 that I need." And this is about setting
 expectations
 and saying, "Look, if I have an
 expectation, if I run all these Monte
 Carlo simulations
 and the vast majority of them are above,
 I'm just throwing out a number 4%
 rate of return."
 That's the rate of return I need to be
 looking for for my portfolio saying,
 "Look, as long as I can make 4%,
 I've got a 98-99% chance of meeting my
 goals."
 Exactly. That's the right way to use it,
 right? Again,
 that's not the way most plans run
 because these off-the-box plans, these
 off-the-shelf calculators, etc.,
 they're very, very basic and they don't
 take into account all the
 variabilities that happen with markets
 over long-term time frames. So it's very
 important to get really behind those
 numbers
 and understand that what the financial
 plan is for
 is to say, "This is how much risk you
 need to take to reach your goal with
 certainty."
 And then you build a portfolio, most
 importantly,
 to meet that goal, not exceed that
 goal.
 Because there's a huge difference. If my
 plan says 4%,
 I go, "Yeah, but Adam, give me 5%."
 That's a 20% increase
 in the amount of return I need, but
 that's almost 100%
 increase in the amount of risk I've got
 to add to the portfolio just to create a
 1% rate of return additional rate
 in the portfolio. That's where the
 mistakes happen and that's where you
 wind up losing too much money and
 missing your goal.
 Alright, so totally agree and I think we
 now look at Monte Carlo the same way.
 So here's the other question I want to
 throw into the mix here which is,
 it's one thing to say, "Okay, yeah, I need
 to get that 4% rate of return and we
 think we can get it and
 if I follow that path I'll hit this
 milestone in five years and this
 milestone in 10 years."
 That's one way to do the planning.
 Another way to do the planning is to
 start and say, "Where do you want to be in
 five years? Where do you want to be in 10
 years?" and say, "Okay, great. Here's the
 number that you're shooting for.
 We think
 through our planning and analysis with
 your investments we can get you x percent
 rate of return. Maybe that gets you there.
 Maybe it doesn't."
 But as you're then proceeding
 towards that goal and you're having
 check-ins with your team over
 time,
 if you're off target at all
 it brings in the ability to have to say,
 and therefore we're taking on potentially
 a lot more risk going from four to
 five. That's 25%
 gain and risk here now. Maybe it's what
 can you do to put away an extra
 x percent every month or quarter going
 forward which will then help you get to
 your goal but the risk is down and then
 if the market
 starts performing better for us well
 then maybe it actually starts out
 performing for you.
 No, I mean look that should be the basis
 of your plan period. You should not rely
 on the market to do anything.
 You know if in my perfect world your
 return would be zero in your plan every
 year
 and you'd say, "Look if I want to reach a
 million dollars in retirement
 how much money do I have to save every
 month between now and then
 to get there?" Because if I do that,
 if my whole plan
 mentally is based on what I'm saving,
 right?
 Look Charlie Munger just
 passed away, rest in peace.
 Brilliant man. One thing he says is, "Hey
 if you want to be rich
 spend less than you make." I mean it's
 you know it's not rocket science. So if
 you build a plan
 based solely on your savings,
 all the look this is where everybody
 goes wrong with the markets, right? And
 this is this is a function of
 of the media, it's a function of wall
 street, it's a function of
 everybody else. Because
 what everybody's figured out wall
 street, the media, etc.
 is that if I can get you to throw money
 into the market they make money, right?
 In fact I'm writing an article, it's this
 weekend's newsletter talking about
 why wall street analysts are always
 optimistic.
 In the chart that I have in there, I've
 got two charts in there showing where
 the retail investor
 lands relative to wall street analysts.
 You're at the bottom of the list.
 Nobody cares about you. They don't care
 if you make money, they don't care if you
 lose money.
 You are so far at the bottom of the list.
 Why? Because
 their their clients are institutions.
 They're the guys that are doing
 secondary offering for,
 IPO's for, doing investment banking for,
 you know,
 you know doing bond offerings for. That's
 where all the money's made,
 right? What wall street needs
 you for is they need you to sell the
 product to, right? If I do an IPO I got
 to sell it to somebody.
 They need the patsy at the poker
 table. Exactly.
 So if you build your
 financial plan saying look,
 I'm going to save my way to retirement,
 which is the way you should do it, right?
 How much money do I need to save to have
 enough when I retire?
 What the market is for, and this is all
 the market is for,
 is to ensure that those savings are
 adjusting for the rate of inflation
 over time so that the purchasing power
 of the dollars that you saved 30 years
 ago
 have the same purchasing power today 30
 years later when you go into retirement.
 A million dollars in 1980 you could
 retire on.
 You could make 12 percent from the bond
 market. You had a million dollars. Your
 cost of living was about $30,000.
 Easy. A million dollars today 30, 40, 50
 years later because of inflation
 and everything else that's gone on. It
 ain't going to cut it. You're not going
 to survive in retirement on a million
 bucks if you have a
 $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 standard of
 living.
 Well, and especially if yields go
 back down to where they were just a
 couple years ago,
 you're certainly not going to be able to.
 Right, but look, even if you take
 five percent yields on the treasury,
 right? I have a million dollars. I put it
 in treasury at five percent.
 Only 50 grand, yeah.
 50 grand. What's the average cost of
 living today? 65.
 You're still short, right? So you have to
 so if you look at if you change your
 focus from how much I can gamble and
 speculate in the markets
 to try to, you know, try to get rich from
 investing
 and change it to how do I protect my
 savings and make sure my savings adjust
 for inflation over time.
 A, you're going to do a lot better. You'll
 lower your risk tolerance in the markets
 and you will reach your goal because the
 primary driver for your goal is how much
 money you're saving,
 not how much money you're hoping to make
 out of the markets. But see,
 when we changed the whole market to a
 casino,
 we devastated retirement savers. This is
 why 80 percent of Americans can't retire
 because they have no money in the bank.
 Even though they're invested, this whole
 idea that markets just make everybody
 wealthy,
 it hasn't worked in 40 years, right?
 So if it did, because as you said many
 times, you know,
 if it did, we wouldn't have these
 stats that, you know,
 two-thirds of American households can't
 come up with 400 bucks in an emergency
 or whatever it is. Exactly right.
 Yeah, and there's, I think, a
 direct analog we can
 try or tie as well to the housing market,
 which used to
 appreciate it about the rate of
 inflation right up until the end
 of the 90s and all the financialization
 and everything and now it's become this
 massive Ponzi scheme that everybody is
 totally afraid of bursting because
 that's where most Americans have
 "the majority of their wealth"
 right now. By the way,
 sorry to interrupt you, but
 that's an awesome point you just made.
 It's not that houses used to appreciate
 at the rate of inflation,
 that's what they should appreciate at.
 Right. Your real estate
 should appreciate at the rate of
 inflation over time and that's what they
 did
 all the way through the 90s and then
 when we got into adjustable rate
 mortgages,
 you know, dual mortgages to avoid, you
 know, PMI insurance,
 ninja loans, all this other stuff, we turn,
 you know, the housing market into a
 speculative asset
 and the consequences are now that
 people can't afford to buy a house.
 So I'm probably going to get, you know,
 just skewered for saying this, but
 there's this concept of
 insufficient but necessary.
 They're like steps you have to take
 which in and of themselves aren't going
 to solve your problem but they're an
 essential part of solving the problem so
 you got to take them.
 And I think to retire
 wealthy, retire securely,
 you have to invest
 smartly, wisely, prudently,
 but I think it might be insufficient,
 but it's necessary. You got
 to do it but what you also have to do is
 you've got to focus on the earning part
 and you got to be saving and squirreling
 away a lot of the excess of
 what you're earning and spending less
 than what you're producing
 and it's the combination of everything
 people have been told, "We all want the
 investing is what makes you rich."
 As long as you put money away it's going
 to go bananas over time and every
 stock is going to be a meme stock
 and you're going to make a ton of money
 on a tropical island somewhere.
 Hopefully, and I know you and your team
 are trying to get people the best
 risk adjusted return that you can get,
 but I think maybe we really have to
 to doing the hard work over time and if
 we do we'll get there and if
 fantastic but yeah look and look there
 are very few people in the world that
 have ever gotten rich investing. You
 could probably count them on one hand
 and Warren Buffett got rich. No, no, no.
 Warren Buffett didn't get rich
 investing. He got rich investing other
 people's money.
 Right and into businesses that he could
 control not just speculative papers.
 Absolutely. Ray Dalio. How did Ray Dalio
 get so rich
 investing other people's money? So you
 take a look at any of these really rich
 investors that,
 you know, Steve Cohen, Ray
 Dalio, all of them.
 How did they get rich? Did they get rich
 just investing their own money?
 No, they all got rich running hedge funds,
 you know, patient or whatever.
 Right, but they were investing other
 people's money in the market. That's
 where they made their money
 and so, you know, this is why it's, you
 know,
 you know, I get emails from, you know,
 your viewers and they say, "Hey, I'm
 22,
 23. You know, I've been
 watching Adams and, you know, I
 want to protect my wealth from the next
 major downturn in the market." I'm like,
 that's the worst thing you can do.
 Best thing you can do is follow these
 steps.
 Maximum funds, so out of every paycheck,
 first thing you do is
 break your maximum funding for your 401k
 plan down by 12 months.
 Hit that number every single month right
 out of your paycheck. You're going to
 reduce your taxes to the federal
 government
 by fully funding your 401k plan. If your
 wife doesn't work and doesn't have an
 401k plan, do a spousal IRA for her.
 Take that money right out of your
 paycheck. Fund that spousal IRA.
 Then save up an additional amount of
 money. When you get that to 10 or 20
 thousand dollars,
 buy an S&P 500 index fund and then every
 month just keep cramming money into that.
 Why? Because you've got 30, 40 years ahead
 of you.
 You've got plenty of time and so if
 you're saving 30 to 40 percent of your
 income
 and investing it, you're going to do
 great. You're not going to have
 any financial trouble ever and it
 doesn't matter. All these other
 narratives about the world coming to an
 end, whatever.
 It doesn't matter. You're going to win
 over time simply because of inflation
 and time and that's the
 hard truth that just plays out over
 time.
 You're not going to be a massive
 multi-trillionaire at all.
 You're going to get an average rate
 of return over time.
 You're going to have years where you're
 losing a lot of money
 when the markets do go through
 downturns but you keep saving and you
 keep putting that money away because you
 have time.
 Where you really need risk management
 is when you're in your 40s your 50s
 you're heading into retirement and you
 can't suffer
 a major loss to your portfolio but that
 time mostly you know look when you're
 young you don't have any money anyway so
 if you lose money
 it's not that much but when you're in
 your 40s 50s you've now got your nest
 egg theoretically saved up.
 That's where you've got to really do the
 risk management. You've got to be
 worried about these
 these downturns in the markets the
 things that will cause those
 cataclysmic events etc and you've got to
 prepare and manage for that stuff
 but if you're young you have time man
 just
 you know the it's the 50-20-30 rule
 you see 50 percent of your money that
 you make that goes to your essentials
 that's your
 so your your mortgage should be no more
 than 15 percent
 of your total net after-tax income your
 mortgage shouldn't be more than 15
 percent of that
 um that includes rent so
 um you know then that's the rest of your
 utility that's your utilities that's
 your cell phone
 you know well i can't afford an iphone
 15 on that well no you may have to use a
 flip phone right because that's all you
 can afford
 20 is your discretionary budget that's
 what you're
 you know going out look i don't want
 you to not have any fun in your life
 20 that's your dating money that's
 you're spending money on your wife
 whatever it is
 30 is the savings you've got to set that
 goal and you've got to get yourself
 working that goal and then as your
 income increases that goal's never you
 don't adjust that it's
 always the same percentages of every
 after-tax dollar you bring in
 because that's how you're going to build
 wealth over time and people will
 and when i tell this stuff to people i
 immediately get lash bags like oh that's
 impossible nobody can do that
 i've been doing it for 40 years right
 and it doesn't matter you can do it you
 just got to be willing to sacrifice
 to do it you can't have everything you've
 got to have delayed gratification
 just because you think you want it
 doesn't mean you really need it and look
 a really good rule of thumb is is that
 if you say look i really want something
 i want an iphone
 whatever it is wait you know put it put
 it on you know put it on the side wait
 three months
 and in three months if you still really
 need it then you probably really need it
 maybe you should make plans to go buy it
 for cash
 um not on credit not on payment plans if
 you can't pay cash you can't afford it
 so if you follow those rules though
 you'll be great you'll never have to
 worry about
 financial troubles markets economies
 nothing you're going to be fine
 but you got to do it like you said brown
 you got to have the discipline to do it
 to do it yeah and and in in my my rant
 earlier i i don't want to discount
 the um the benefits and advantages
 that you know the the miracle
 compounding
 puts at your back over enough time on
 this
 um so you know i i when i say necessary
 but insufficient or insufficient but
 necessary
 um i don't want to underplay uh the the
 the long-term benefits that this does
 give you over time and lance i agree
 with with just about everything you said
 and i think the percentages that you
 gave
 super duper useful for folks i
 appreciate you doing i agree with all of
 that
 um i think maybe the one thing i'll push
 back on
 is um adopting risk management early in
 your life is not the worst thing that
 these guys could do
 no it's not let me tell you why
 i'll tell you why it is because this is
 why what happens to every investor over
 time
 they adopt these ideas of risk management
 right i'm going to be
 oh adam said that there's a crash coming
 next year
 so i'm going to get all out of the
 market and then
 maybe the crash comes right we saw this
 in 2008 great example of this and again
 i'm only talking about if you're in your
 20s i'm not talking about your 30s not
 talking about your 40s not talking about
 your 50s
 you're in your 20s you don't have any
 money invested
 right you may have a few hundred bucks
 so if you lose half of 400 bucks it's not
 the end of the world in terms of your
 retirement
 get another 200 bucks go work an extra
 job go do a side gig whatever put the
 200 bucks back in there
 get back to saving and investing but
 risk management for
 most for the vast majority of people is
 the worst thing they can do because
 they'll get themselves out of the market
 at the bottom
 they won't get into the market when the
 market rallies then they buy the top of
 the next market
 we see this over and over this is why
 the average investor buy lows and sells
 highs constantly october
 great reasoning i mean exactly the same
 comments in october
 all the people that were on my twitter
 feed that were listening to you were
 going oh this
 adam said this market is going to go down
 from here
 and i was like really clear i didn't say
 that either i was getting i know i'm
 i'm picking on you but i'm exaggerating
 a bit yes but the point is is that
 people take this risk management and
 there's a there's an important task about
 risk management
 it's understanding the range of
 possibilities when you're managing risk
 i've got to manage for the risk of being
 wrong as well as the risk of being right
 what most people do is they get out
 entirely
 under the fear that they're going to be
 wrong so we're in agreement
 i'm not i'm not i get what you're saying
 and i'm actually in agreement with you
 which is
 risk management is a practice right and
 what you don't want to do is be driven
 by fear which is
 totally what you're very accurately
 saying a lot of people do is they make
 terrible decisions out of fear
 but risk management is a practice so two
 things one
 you can do way stupider things in your
 20s and i
 you and i both have right right right
 there with you
 that you can you can go and you know buy
 the ridiculously overpriced sports car
 that you have no business buying right
 you could be throwing it all into
 shiba ino and dogecoin or whatever right
 i mean there are way stupider things
 that people could be doing with their
 money than being a little bit too
 conservative
 and the reason why i mentioned this is
 it's a practice
 you have to get comfortable with risk
 both with
 okay how do i protect against certain
 risks that i'm concerned about but also
 how do i not take
 how do i not be too conservative right
 and you're going to err on both sides
 and so all i'm saying is is i agree with
 what you're saying which is you want to
 lean much more into
 risk taking if you will when you can
 afford it when you're younger
 but you also want to be
 beginning to exercise the muscles and the
 awareness of when do i need to pay
 attention to what right and and through
 all this work with a good financial
 advisor who can be giving you advice and
 you can be learning and reacting to it
 absolutely look if you want to do that
 let's say let's go back to our 20s
 example right so first thing you do is
 fully fund your 401k plan second thing
 fully fund your spousal ira or have her
 fund her 401k plan
 then have your emergency fund set aside
 for bad times right because that's you
 happen to your assets when something goes
 wrong
 then you save up an additional ten or
 twenty thousand dollars right and you
 set that aside into a speculation account
 go learn how to do the market right
 first thing you do is is is to learn how
 markets work is buy an index fund
 right and don't touch it just watch it
 put ten thousand dollars in spy
 watch it learn how the markets work okay
 market was down today
 why was the market down today market was
 down last month why was the market down
 last month
 right or it was up why understand
 how the market works then break that
 break the index down into its sub
 components which are the sectors okay
 what's driving this sector what's
 driving this sector is the interest rates
 is inflation
 is it economic activity what is it
 what's driving these individuals so
 learn then learn how the sectors work
 once you understand how the sectors work
 then you break it down again into its
 smaller parts which are the individual
 stocks okay within the financial sector
 why is jp morgan rallying and berkshire
 hathaway falling
 right you know whatever so then you
 learn this over this takes years right
 it's not right
 this is the three months just be clear
 this is your drive the car
 before you figure out how to rebuild the
 engine right right yeah i mean you know
 if i if i took my son into the garage
 right now and there was
 you know all the parts to build a car he
 wouldn't have a clue right
 but you know i can work with him and i
 can take all those parts and we can
 build a car together that we can do
 but it's better to learn how the car
 operates first
 before you start breaking it down into
 its components right and and that's so
 if you want to take 10 000 and say look
 if i lose this 10 000 entirely it's my
 i'm
 this is my investment education right
 this is just like spending money in
 college
 and if i would it doesn't have to be 10
 i'm just through a number i could be a
 thousand it could be five
 five hundred it doesn't matter just a
 number that if it goes to zero
 it doesn't affect anything else because
 why i'm fully funding my 401k that's a
 very conservative investment
 i've got my my ira very conservative i'm
 not speculating i'm not buying bitcoin
 in my ira i'm not buying bitcoin in my
 401k point
 over uber conservative be uber
 conservative
 in those retirement accounts because
 those have 30 years to grow
 and they're going to be there for you in
 retirement that's what that money's for
 so i mean if you put it all in money
 market that's fine all right you know
 it's it's completely okay to do that
 because over time it's about the the the
 savings that you're doing for your
 retirement
 speculate with the money in your after
 tax account at least if you lose it you
 can write it off on your taxes
 but learn how the market works and then
 they flow over time
 how they how they respond to certain
 then you can take that information and
 then start going to manage your 401k and
 ira a bit better
 okay all right look um i think we've
 done a good job of being financial dads
 here um i've got another dad rant i want
 to try to get to this week because we
 didn't get it to it last week but we got
 a lot of other wood to chop beforehand
 so it might need to be punted again
 um i want to get your trades before i do
 there are two other topics maybe even
 quick three
 um we i mentioned we were going to talk
 about um
 liquidity yep and this is interesting
 because you mentioned earlier that the
 six-month average for the leading
 indicators
 leading economic indicators is
 beginning to tick up which you know
 folks would say oh hey maybe we're
 getting out of the woods here right
 the data i'm about to mention may
 contradict that a little bit um this
 comes from simon white uh bloomberg by
 the way a guy i've been trying to get on
 this program having a hard time track
 down his contact info but i really like
 the work that he does
 here's what he had to say he said
 liquidity has been buoyant over the last
 month principally due to the
 approximately 200 billion dollar rise in
 central bank reserves
 money market funds de facto funding the
 fiscal deficit via the purchase of t
 bills
 and the government withdrawing funds
 from the treasury's account at the
 federal reserve
 combined to boost high power liquidity
 driving a rally in stocks and bonds so
 this may be
 partly why november was such a great
 start to reflect a fed cutting rates to
 try to stem a recession
 which stocks are very much not
 discounting
 at the moment um so we've got this this
 basically change an impulse of federal
 reserves
 that is generally a leading indicator
 for the markets and i'm going to try to
 pull up a chart of this that we can
 react to here lance but i'm curious
 i've got the chart right here because i
 have published a regular basis yeah and
 this is this is also a function of our
 newsletter last weekend
 in particular so here let me uh share a
 screen with you
 i love how you're anticipating uh the
 data i'm going to bring up here lance
 i've been building that financial
 liquidity chart for about two years now
 um and it's kind of it's kind of been
 catching on more and more and more people
 are producing it now
 um
 but so if we look if we take a look at
 yeah so this is a monetary conditions
 index
 and this is basically taking into
 account liquidity and what we're seeing
 is an uptick in this liquidity this is a
 long-term chart of this
 but we saw an uptick in november in that
 liquidity
 now also too monetary conditions as a
 function are also declining so again
 that financial tightness that we talked
 about is also starting to come off
 a bit because of this rally in liquidity
 that we've seen so we're going to see
 more and more
 of you know you know that that rally is
 as long as
 we're seeing that monetary liquidity
 flow coming in and again simon's right
 that if we got a really bad economic
 report etc the fed may step in but ism
 was was basically
 zero uh from last month it's 46.7 last
 month 46.7 this month
 so there was no change in the
 manufacturing index at all so again when
 we start to
 put in the year-over-year rates of
 change in these indexes we're seeing that
 economic
 data starting to improve on a
 year-over-year basis doesn't mean that
 it's it's good economic data don't get
 me wrong about that
 but it does mean that we're starting to
 see an improvement in the year-over-year
 rate of change and that's just simply a
 function
 of how the data works over time right we
 talked about that with inflation the
 year-over-year rate of change would bring
 inflation down
 which is what we've seen for the last
 year so you know we're going to see
 more of this
 you know type of confusing data shall i
 say
 because we're just simply to the point
 that
 we've been in this recessionary downturn
 cycle for so long now it's going on 18
 months
 the inverted yield curves as an example
 very long stretch of inverted yield
 curves no recession
 those are going to start to
 theoretically those are going to finally
 start to improve
 just simply because of the amount of
 time that we've been in recessionary
 territory
 doesn't mean we won't have a recession
 at some point
 but the longer that it goes without us
 having a recession
 the likelihood of having one
 is starting to get contracted a bit
 right so i'm just going to pull up this
 chart because i think it
 i just want to show the discrepancy he's
 talking about because i
 i think this is on a
 one one month change one month change
 it's on a shorter time frame
 but it shows this right
 here at the end you can see the
 divergence
 right where you see the the yellow is
 where the impulse is actually now
 starting to recede
 but
 the stock market which is there in the
 dark line
 you know its percent change has been
 shooting the moon
 of recent and so at some point these are
 likely going to have to
 come back together again and it's either
 going to be
 the reserves are going to have to
 shoot back up again or that the market's
 going to have to
 potentially you know stop at least stop
 growing
 well that's and that's and that's
 another part where you know that could
 contribute to a sell-off in the market
 because
 you know again we are starting we you
 know we we did see this big kind of
 uptick
 in liquidity and again it's interesting
 because liquidity you know despite the
 fact the fed's doing qt
 and you know we've had high interest
 rates liquidity has basically been flat
 uh for 18 months it's just gone
 sideways and it upticked here just
 recently so
 this whole idea and this is
 why last year everybody was like oh we're
 gonna have this big bear market we're
 gonna be down you know 40 50 whatever it
 is and it never happened because we
 didn't have that big drain of liquidity
 out of the market that everybody was
 expecting
 right and I think that that's
 if anything I think that has been the
 surprise factor this year is how much
 liquidity has has remained in the system
 been put in the system even though we've
 been told
 oh you know
 bed tightening
 you know unprecedented
 aggressiveness and hiking interest rates
 there's been enough going on behind the
 scenes
 both in terms of reserves
 and in terms of fiscal spending
 fiscal deficit spending that's been
 kind of keeping the party going
 along a lot longer than folks could have
 imagined and of course the big question
 for
 2024 is is you know is it going to be
 able to continue or not of course
 there's a lot of folks who are saying
 they're going to be able to participate
 during an election year
 and then there are others who obviously
 have differences of opinion
 and that gets me to one of the
 questions that folks asked
 Lance which I just want to ask you
 since we're now officially in December
 which is you know knowing that you're
 going to be on this program
 every week during the year to give us
 updates on a weekly basis
 what's your general outlook right now
 for 2024 for the markets?
 Sum that up for you in three words
 yeah I know you're going to go there I
 know well and the reason is
 here oh by the way this was
 before we jumped there real quick hold on
 but this was the chart I was looking for
 and again it's the
 same chart you were just looking at but
 a little bit smoother data flow but this
 is the S index
 this is the
 which is yeah that's it right so this is
 the
 it's the the liquidity index so think
 about this for a second it's the fed
 balance sheet
 minus the treasury generally account
 minus
 reverse repo so in order for the index
 to go up that means the balance sheet
 actually has to be expanding because
 you're subtracting everything else
 from the balance sheet so the balance
 sheet for the fed has been expanding
 despite the fact that they're
 theoretically doing qt right so
 but that's you see that uptick and again
 this was saying is like you know since
 october 2022 when
 this bull market started so so
 go back to the you know early 2022
 liquidity index was falling with the
 market and remember in october of 2022
 you and I were talking about hey
 we're you know we're so negative in the
 markets we're going to get a rally
 um coming out of this because you know
 you have everybody was super bearish in
 october of 2022
 and so it has to be you know ultimately
 the bottom of the of the kind of the
 bear market cycle we were in
 and that's exactly when liquidity went
 flat line so
 liquidity goes flat line the market
 starts to get to go higher because
 liquidity is now stabilized
 and then you have the fed you know fed
 takes action with the svb
 you know uh you know banking crisis they
 start the
 the uh bank bailout program they the
 bank term funding program
 uh that provided a big bump to liquidity
 the markets so that got
 filtered into the markets and then
 recently here you've had this
 this recent uptick after the sell-off in
 the market in october it's interesting
 because as the market was selling off
 and as
 interest rates were going up that
 consumer confidence was getting
 ratcheted down consumers were getting
 very negative
 in september october so i'm really not
 surprised
 that the fed made that change that they
 did and you've seen liquidity coming
 back into the market
 because the fed doesn't want a recession
 they want a soft landing
 and they don't want deflation they want
 inflation they just want two percent
 inflation
 so you know they're working behind the
 scenes to try to land this plane we'll
 see how successful they're going to be
 but
 you know this is this is going to be the
 question going into 2024
 and this is why i don't know is the
 answer and
 in fact tuesday's post on our website is
 talking about wall street predictions for
 2024 everybody's
 super bullish for next year 5100 5500
 5300
 all the wall street firms are expecting
 this bull market to continue i think
 that's a risky bet
 because there's a there's a whole lot of
 data out there that suggests that next
 year could be another very sloppy year
 um you know like we saw in 2022 maybe
 you know part of 2023 where you know we
 have this rally then another decline and
 another rally as we continue to kind of
 work through
 you know this slower economic
 environment because
 you know earnings expectations are for
 220 a share next year
 if you have slower economic growth
 you're not going to get to 220 valuations
 are going to be a very important factor
 that here i'll tell you what i'll sneak
 i'll sneak you a peek
 at some charts from tuesday's article
 real quick
 and because i did some analysis on this
 showing you know valuation structures
 and
 what this um theoretically is going to
 look like
 let me uh back up so okay so
 that's not what i'm looking for but
 here's that was 2023 estimates
 um oh going the wrong way
 bear with me sorry so this is
 estimating the smp so this is based
 solely on valuations
 no recession next year is and this is
 what the market's betting on
 and assuming we can maintain 22 times
 earnings that puts a target at 48 45
 for the smp 500 if you assume a
 recession a soft landing recession
 valuations fall to 17 which is kind of
 historical average
 then you're talking about 37 44
 so from 4 500 where we are now to 37 44
 that's about a 17 decline
 um if we look at the historical length
 of recessions of market declines
 that would be completely normal right
 you have a research
 sorry just to make sure that that's
 soft landing equals 17 decline right
 a hard landing you know a normal
 recession
 is on average about a 33 decline very
 very similar to what we saw
 in march of 2020 right so we 33 down
 three months three month recession so
 now if we take a look at a multiple
 expansion which was this year
 right so 2022 uh sorry 2023
 you had multiple expansion and
 so if we assume that we actually expand
 multiples from say
 22 23 times earnings to 24 24 and a half
 now you've got a target of 53 95 that's
 about in line with where wall street's
 expecting right now so what they're
 expecting is
 and this is all assuming 220 a share in
 december of 2024 for the s&p
 again the big risk is is that if you
 have solar economic growth
 earnings are gonna have to come down and
 in fact
 um you know lance that's that's
 millennial earnings season game
 yeah that's absolutely correct so we can
 price this out though and this is your
 range of outcomes for 2024
 take your pick right and so if you're
 super bullish and you're gonna tune
 20 a share then you know you're looking
 at 5400
 be long stocks if you think you're going
 to have a reduction
 in earnings for growth valuations are
 going to matter
 and markets have to reprice for lower
 valuations that doesn't mean
 the markets will be down 20 next year
 that's just one
 theoretical possibility but you're
 certainly going to have a year of much
 lower rates of return
 than you know a market that's up you
 know six eight nine ten percent next
 year
 this is super useful and there are times
 where I really do
 charts this is a great chart
 the ranges of what could happen under
 that whole article is going to be out on
 And the chart that you just
 kicked all this off with, the
 liquidity chart,
 I look at charts like
 that and Simon Weitz and I go back to a
 people about liquidity but had a really
 deep dive
 interview on liquidity with Michael Howell
 and I was like, "Lance,
 are we just overthinking all this?
 Is it just all about liquidity flows,
 net liquidity flows into the market?
 Could we just only look at that
 and just ignore everything else and
 pretty much be 85% on all the time?"
 And certainly that's what that sort of
 that's just always tells the tale
 and also because liquidity hasn't
 been rising as fast as the S&P right now,
 maybe that gives us a bit more confidence
 that the S&P is going to be due for some
 sort of correction at some point in time
 just because if liquidity is all that
 matters it's getting a little bit ahead
 of it.
 Since 2009,
 I'll produce a chart on a regular
 basis that shows the Fed balance sheet
 versus the market and all the different
 events that have gone on
 and it's clear. I mean if the Fed's
 putting capital.
 Let me back up one second because
 this is really important.
 I get a lot of emails talking about
 Fed liquidity and
 how that's going to create inflation and
 they're just printing money.
 The Fed does not print money, right?
 The Treasury prints money, right? So
 they're the ones that produce the money.
 What the Fed does is they do an asset
 swap.
 All they're doing is digital ones and
 zeros. They say, "Okay, Bank of America,
 you've got
 a billion dollars worth of this 10-year
 Treasury coupon.
 I'm going to credit your reserve
 account with the Federal Reserve
 for a billion dollars. You're going to
 give me that bond." And they do an asset
 swap.
 That is not inflationary. It doesn't
 create more money in the system.
 It boosts asset prices because that
 money in that reserve account then goes
 through the Bank of America's prop
 trading desk. It gets invested into
 stocks,
 so forth and so on, and that's how it
 affects the markets. But this is why
 during the entirety of 2009, 10, 11,
 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
 we never had inflation. Inflation was
 limping along at two percent.
 The Fed was keeping rates at
 zero trying to keep inflation at two.
 The Fed was actually fighting to keep
 inflation at two percent
 because if they had hiked rates or done
 anything at that point, inflation would
 have dropped and we've been in a
 recession.
 Keeping CPI propped up near two percent.
 Correct.
 Yeah, exactly. But importantly,
 when the Fed does QE, that is
 non-inflationary. It's just an asset swap.
 So that's the big
 differential that we've got to be
 aware of is that this is why the Fed
 feels very confident
 that they've talked about
 the rate hikes and they're not worried
 about an economic slowdown. They're not
 worried about a recession because they
 have the tools to offset that. That means
 that their tools are QE and zero
 interest rates and they'll do
 that in a heartbeat. Make money cheap and
 create a bunch of it. Exactly.
 But all they're doing is
 assets. That's all
 they're doing. They're making money
 available to the banks,
 not the individual. And so, Lance,
 we just had inflation running at nine
 percent.
 It wasn't because of the Fed. It was
 because we sent checks to households
 from the Treasury.
 The Treasury printed money, sent
 checks to households. Those income from
 the Fed that came from the Treasury.
 All of a sudden, people had money to
 spend and they went out and bought stuff
 in a time where the economy was shut
 down. So you had
 lots of demand, no supply,
 that's inflation. That's how
 you get inflation. That had nothing to do
 with the Fed.
 Totally agree.
 Where to take this? I got to lay on
 the plane because we're running out of
 time here. I'm going to
 push off the rent. I'm going to push off
 the rent again,
 which is too bad because it's an
 interesting one.
 Just give me the topic.
 The topic is kind of the epidemic of
 anxiety and depression in this country
 and really what might be
 the root cause of it.
 I know that answer.
 You probably do, but we're going to --
 No, that's a symptom.
 I will promise you Facebook,
 Twitter, I can tell you from
 today, that is the root cause of
 depression in this country.
 Well, look, I would say it's
 definitely a massive contributor but I
 don't think it's the main cause.
 I think you'll agree with me and we'll
 have a great discussion on it but it's
 going to not have to be this week.
 TLT,
 tons of people asking about it.
 Two questions about bonds.
 One, has your outlook that you've shared
 with us in the past changed at all?
 You're revising any parts of it given
 what's happened recently and then
 secondly, no. Okay, but I'll let you
 expand on that if you want to.
 Let's say what 10-year
 treasury yield would be your exit target
 on this trade?
 First of all, the outlook, so again,
 let me be clear, my outlook on
 bonds has not changed because,
 as I told you before, it's an 18 to 36
 month outlook.
 We've had a very nice rally in bonds
 since the last month.
 So if you're trading bonds,
 so if you bought bonds a month ago
 and it's a trade,
 so because bonds are very overbought
 right now, you're going to get a
 correction and you can buy them back for
 your next trade. I'm not trading bonds.
 We don't trade for
 our clients like that. We make long-term
 investments.
 So our thesis is still 18 to 36 months.
 That's still an economic slowdown,
 potentially slash recession.
 Feds have to cut rates to zero at some
 point. When that occurs yields are going
 to fall
 and our target is probably somewhere
 between one, one and a half percent, which
 should correspond with where inflation
 winds up
 by the time we get there. Remember, yields
 are just a function of inflation and
 economic growth, so
 as inflation and economic growth
 approach two percent,
 so will yields. Okay, and is that sort of
 what you're looking at?
 That's where we think this
 bet we're making or this investment
 thesis we're making, it's going to
 probably go in that direction when we
 head near there?
 No, you can't sustain economic
 growth above two percent
 because of the debt. So the debt's going
 to drag you to two percent. So as the
 debt drags you to two percent, that's
 going to drag inflation to two percent.
 As you continue to weigh on economic
 sustainability,
 yields will fall to align with economic
 growth and inflation because those all
 have to work together.
 You can't have one out of whack. So, you
 know, if you take a look at,
 you know, GDP right now, we're running at
 about, you know, four, you know, we've
 just clipped off 5.2 percent. GDP for the
 third quarter,
 we're going to be somewhere around three,
 three and a half probably in fourth
 quarter.
 Inflation's running around three, three
 and a half percent. So, you know,
 interest rates are starting to come back
 down towards that level. We
 talked about
 a couple weeks ago how bonds have got
 deeply
 undervalued relative to the economic
 data. So that's now starting to finally
 align itself and that's going to kind of
 start to hover around here somewhere, but
 as the economy continues to grind lower
 that's going to pull rates down with it.
 Okay, all right. Trades. What trades, if
 any, did you make? None this week. Okay, and
 you had sort of prepped us for that
 because you're still, I believe, kind
 of hunkered down
 for the short-term correction that you
 see in the markets, after which it
 happens you will then take action. Right,
 yeah. We did our tax loss selling, we
 raised cash,
 we've been rebounding, we were
 buying stuff in October,
 we rebounded, we did our tax loss
 selling really kind of in November on
 the rally,
 and so now we're holding a little bit of
 extra cash looking for a pullback here
 to round out the rest of our positions.
 Okay, and if we had had more time here I
 look at this chart, right, and look, just a
 function is that
 high interest rates impaired the
 collateral of these banks. These banks
 all own treasuries, right, for the most
 part.
 So yeah, they're swapping out
 these loans to keep their collateral
 values in line so they're not shut down
 like
 regional banks were. So, you know,
 that's the use of this is just the
 change in rates and collateral values
 and those type of things, but
 it's not an impending economic doom
 scenario. There is some certainly some
 stress in the financials. I'm not saying
 that at all.
 We're very light on financial
 exposure right now because of commercial
 real estate,
 but we're going to be working
 through that
 process over the next 12 months.
 Right, so we can't have the full
 discussion now but I'm happy to have it
 when we come on next time, but
 there are a few other things was getting
 to add on to it including the
 commercial real estate risk, but
 the BTFP is a one-year loan
 to these banks and so we are now getting
 close to the one year anniversary where
 these guys are going to have to take
 these things
 back on their books. So that's going
 to be interesting to talk about and then
 there's another article
 about what's going on in China right now
 where apparently their banks
 are kind of being forced into this
 national service
 of
 kind of rescuing
 the
 developers and other big companies in
 the property sector
 there and so they're continually
 under pressure as well. So the question
 I was just going to ask is
 do you see any rumblings, any warning
 signs about kind of the global banking
 system or
 not something that's really on your
 radar right now?
 There's really not much there at the
 moment. Look, China's bailed out their
 stuff. We were talking about China
 building all these ghost towns and
 everything else
 10 years ago and said, "Hey, this is
 eventually going to be a huge problem."
 Surprise, here it is.
 I'm communist economy. They'll just bail
 it all out. If they've
 got to buy it all, they'll just buy it
 all and burn it down
 and then rebuild it again to create
 economic activity.
 It's a communist country.
 They can do that.
 There's
 certainly an impact
 of economic activity in China
 relative to the US because we buy a lot
 of goods and services from them and we
 export a lot of goods and services to
 them and so if their economy is under a
 lot of pressure
 then that's certainly going to affect
 our economy from import-export trade
 basis
 but you don't really know what their
 economic data is because they just make
 it up as they go. They don't actually
 report economic data like we report
 economic data. They just, "Oh, here's the
 number." Whatever it is, there it is
 and you just have to take it with a
 grain of salt but it has some sequence
 to reality
 but it can be any number they want.
 They can report any number
 they want. My question, which again we
 can get into more detail next time, but
 sort of about contagion risk and it
 sounds like
 you're not lying awake right now
 worrying about the banking system.
 We don't have
 the structure in the banks
 right now that we had back in 2008 so if
 you're trying to come up with a 2008
 corollary that doesn't exist at the
 moment.
 Is there risk to banks? Absolutely. Could
 we have
 a financially driven credit
 downturn? Absolutely. There's certainly
 risk out there for that. There's a lot of
 debt and so
 defaults on debt, those type of things
 certainly are an economic risk
 but as soon as that happens central banks
 are going to overdrive to bail that out.
 They are not going to let another
 2008 type crisis happen.
 Okay, well look in wrapping up
 here I just want to provide a little bit
 of
 sort of inside clarity into what's
 happening here at the new thoughtful
 money venture that we've got going on
 here and again thanks everybody so much
 for being a part of it. It has just been
 amazing
 how quickly people have found this
 support, your viewership, and continue to
 listen to all your questions as well as
 all your kind comments that you send me
 about how we can continue to improve
 this for you. So just so you know a few
 things that are going on.
 One,
 I'm suffering through and I'm not looking
 for sympathy here but just suffering
 through the
 the solopreneur process of
 everything you got to do to set up a
 business in the background and I just
 sent out a tweet the other day
 showing a skeleton on a customer
 care line.
 The guy basically being told, "Oh,
 your issue is important to us. Our
 experts will be with you shortly." That's
 like been my life behind the scene
 for the past
 month but a big win is we had a problem
 with our adsense which is sort of how we
 monetize this YouTube channel
 which has just taken me forever to get
 fixed. We got that fixed so hooray. We got
 a win on the scoreboard there.
 For those that are still worried about
 my new system here,
 I do have a lighting and sound
 specialist coming in to help me upgrade
 things even further and I actually just
 got notice while Lance and I were
 recording this
 that my upgrade to a higher degree of
 high definition on Zoom apparently has
 just been implemented so hopefully in
 the videos you see coming out from after
 this one will be even clearer which
 will be great.
 I've got the new Thoughtful Money website
 launch coming soon. That would be the
 website where you can go to and request
 a free consultation
 with Lance and his team at RIA or the
 good folks at
 New Harbor Financial who are going to be
 coming on this channel the day after
 this interview airs with Lance.
 Our friends from Rocklink over in Canada
 are going to be available through that
 as well. So all of that is coming soon
 and I'll let you know in this program
 when that new website's out.
 I will be getting a new background here.
 I've gotten lots of comments about the
 green leather.
 Some fans but most people saying they'd
 like Lance. Yes, I'm trying to run that
 business because that's the part of the
 business that we all like and that's
 where all the value is but I'm spending
 a ton of time with all those folks on
 customer care and then when there's
 fictitious free minutes left over I'm
 cramming for that darn securities exam.
 So anyways, that's all the stuff that's
 happening behind the scenes here.

 Just to share some of the folks we've

 continue to have just an amazing lineup.
 Michael Pento, he'll be appearing the
 day after this video airs. We'll have
 Danielle DiMartino Booth as well next
 week but very excited to say I finally
 got a yes from Felix Zulauf and his
 team and so we'll be having Felix Zulauf
 on this program in about a week and I
 know many, many, many of you have been
 asking for him to come back on the
 program. Very happy to say that we
 finally got him to come back on. With
 that being said, Lance, as always I'm
 going to give you the last word here as
 we wrap up.
 Yeah, well I'm thinking it's your new website
 set up if you want access to our
 newsletter, our daily market commentary,
 our blog on Tuesday on prospecting
 future returns, just go to
 realinvestmentadvice.com. You can ask
 questions. I always happy to help you.
 Great. Realinvestmentadvice.com and
 folks, Lance, I was really happy to
 hear that during our hiatus as I was
 getting this whole new thing set up, I
 had a lot of people say how much they
 missed these weekly recaps but also said
 so I've gone over to Lance's YouTube
 channel and I've started watching his
 daily commentary and I've been just
 getting lots of great feedback from
 folks how much they like that. So folks,
 in addition to going to
 realinvestmentadvice.com and watching
 this video every weekend, if you
 haven't gotten your fill of Lance, make
 sure that you go and sign up for his
 YouTube channel and you can enjoy Lance
 on the daily. With that being said, folks,
 if you didn't watch the
 panel replay video from the panel I
 moderated the New Orleans investment
 conference which had Lynn Alden,
 Daniel DiMartino Booth, Jim Rickards, and
 Russ Gray, it's a great discussion. That
 would be a great video to watch after
 this one. I'll put up a link to it right
 here. Lance, my friend, thanks so much for
 another great week. Everybody else, thank
 you so much for watching.
