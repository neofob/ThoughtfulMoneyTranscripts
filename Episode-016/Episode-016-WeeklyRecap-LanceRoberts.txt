 if I'm a betting man and I'm managing money, which I am,
 you know, we raised we use this rally to raise a little bit of cash,
 got rid of our losers.
 We did some tax law selling, reposition our portfolio a bit.
 And so we're kind of expecting here a little bit of a pullback,
 100 points, 150 points, something like that on the S&P,
 then we'll put the cash back to work for year end.
 And look, if we don't get it between now and the end of the year,
 we're going to get a correction at some point.
 The only question is, from what point is that correction
 and where does that correction go to?
 That's just a function of time.
 Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
 I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart, welcoming you back here
 at the end of another week for a weekly market recap
 with my charismatic good friend, portfolio manager, Lance Roberts.
 Lance, how you doing?
 Doing good. It's a Friday.
 Get ready to wrap up for Christmas here soon.
 So can't be too upset about that.
 Yeah, and folks, that's a subtle reminder Lance is giving me here
 that he's got a constraint here on the back end of this recording
 because he's got the holiday party for RA advisors.
 It's a very diplomatic way of you reminding me
 to get to the point quickly in today's video, Lance.
 I will, but in one quick second, I picked charismatic is the word for you, Lance,
 because it is true for sure in spades.
 But apparently, the word for the year,
 I can't remember what organization picks like the new word for the year.
 It's one of these sort of dictionary, you know, nonprofits.
 But the word was Rizz, R-I-Z-Z, which is short for charisma.
 So it's like, you know, that guy really has risen me up or whatever.
 You know, he's got the Rizz.
 So anyways, Lance, you got the Rizz.
 Let's see your Rizz on display today.
 So what you're telling me is, is we've now gotten to the point
 in the English language that we no longer use whole words.
 We're now using slang as words of the year.
 Great. I love this.
 You know, I had the same initial thought, but then I thought, you know what?
 That's what the last generation said about the one coming after it.
 And then their parents said about them.
 It's just been we're just going to end with,
 you know, snarls and grunts, basically, at the end of the day.
 I'm just going to start using all the slang my kids use, you know, like bet.
 So I don't even know what that means.
 And I got kids. Exactly.
 All right. Well, look, OK, so here at the end of the year,
 the week kind of bounced around a little bit this week, the markets.
 But S&P basically looking like it's going to end the week more or less
 where it started.
 Blanche, you have talked about expecting some softness
 in the market before it races off to.
 Maybe even new highs by the end of the year.
 You have also said that that could happen or the other thing
 is that we could do is just just grind sideways for a long time
 to burn off these overbought conditions.
 Seems like we're kind of in the grinding sideways right now.
 Are we indeed burning off the overbought conditions here?
 Barely. You know, so, you know, here, I'll just share our weekly chart
 that we always kind of look at.
 This would all be on the same page.
 So two things are important right now is that, yeah.
 So first of all, the markets has really gone nowhere.
 We've just kind of been trading sideways now for a couple of weeks.
 We go up, we go down, we go up, go down, really not going anywhere.
 The overbought condition is coming down very slightly here.
 We did trigger a MACD sell signal, which does suggest that when you get
 these sell signals, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a big correction right away.
 It means you either get these consolidated moves or you do get a correction of some sort.
 But really what it means more than anything else is when you're triggering it
 from a fairly high level, is it just upside is likely contained a bit.
 You know, we may go up a little bit, but, you know, just not a lot.
 One interesting thing and, you know, on Wednesday was what we call our outside reversal day.
 And that's where the market opens higher than it did the day before,
 but then closes below where it opened the day before.
 And the last time that we had a outside reversal day, we've had these before,
 but the last time we had it where we were both on a MACD sell signal and overbought,
 had that outside reversal day, the next two days were actually positive.
 We went almost all the way back to where the outside reversal day occurred.
 And then you had the correction.
 And it's interesting because we had this outside reversal day,
 the markets rallied back to where it was at, you know, on that day.
 And, you know, so the question now becomes next week,
 do we start getting a little bit of a sell-off heading into Christmas as, you know,
 everything kind of, you know, just kind of gets repositioned for the end of the year kind of closeout?
 Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
 One important thing to note that today is the buyback window
 for corporate share buybacks closes today.
 We had one of the largest, and the month of November was one of the largest months
 for corporate share buybacks on record.
 And, you know, with that window closing, that's just, that doesn't mean
 that the world's going to end tomorrow and have a big correction.
 But you are taking away one of the buyers that has been supporting this rally
 over the course of the last month.
 More importantly, if you just take a look at equity fund inflows as a function,
 those have been declining rather rapidly.
 So we had a big surge in the month of November with money flowing into equity funds, not surprising.
 And now you're starting to see that pace of new money coming into equity funds
 beginning to slow rather rapidly.
 And that just basically, as we've said before, just suggests that, you know,
 buyers and sellers have kind of met a point of equilibrium.
 And so what you need now is some event catalyst, whatever it is,
 that brings sellers kind of out in force and then that allows the market to correct.
 You know, what could that be? Next week is the Fed meeting on Wednesday.
 We've got the inflation report on Tuesday.
 If the inflation report comes in hotter than expected, we saw the employment report on Friday.
 Wage growth came in at 0.4% versus the 0.2 expectation.
 So again, hotter than expected.
 The unemployment rate fell to 3.7.
 That was better than expected.
 So it still suggests that the economy is doing fine, wages are going okay,
 discretionary incomes are fine, which gives us the economy the ability to continue
 to kind of run along here, which does provide pressure for inflation.
 So if we start seeing the idea that maybe Fed, you know, one of the big catalyst
 finest rallies since November was that the Fed was going to move rate cuts
 up until the first quarter in March of next year.
 We may, if we start to see that get kicked out a bit from a little bit hotter than expected data,
 that might weigh on the market short term, give you a little bit of a correction
 to buy into as we head into next year.
 Alright, so a lot to talk about in there.
 Let me just talk about the end of the year here for a second.
 So you have said what's in the past, what you thought was the more likely path
 would be that we'd get some sort of pullback weakness here in the first half of December,
 and then because of all the year-end shenanigans that go on where all the funds
 basically have to first sell their losers and then window dress by all the stocks
 that have done well this year, that there's going to be that surge in buying power.
 And yes, the buyback window is shutting, but we already knew that.
 That's not necessarily news to the market, right?
 So do you think that's still more likely or given sort of all the special conditions
 that resulted in one of the best November's ever on record for both stocks and bonds,
 did we pull the center cause rally in? Did we already have the rally?
 It's actually that's funny. That's the subject of my newsletter this weekend.
 You can find it on the website for free at realinvestmentadvice.com along with all of our videos and more.
 We need to start having a weekly market recap bingo on which topic I'm going to mention
 that you're going to say, "Oh, you know what? Funny. I'm writing an article on that.
 The problem is I think everybody would win. Every single combination would win."
 But yeah, this weekend, we're actually just exploring that idea that we pull it forward,
 and the answer is probably yes to some degree.
 Again, and a lot of this will depend on what the market does over the next couple of weeks.
 So, if the market actually corrects next week and going into Christmas,
 and we do see a pullback and say we get a pullback say 4,500 ish or even like 4,450 on the index.
 It's not that far away, by the way. That's just a hundred points or so.
 Then yeah, that gives the market a better ability to rally into year end
 as portfolio managers, window dress, et cetera.
 If markets just hang around here and do nothing, which is possible,
 they could even maybe grind their way higher a little bit.
 That still doesn't necessarily preclude a year in advance.
 It's just going to limit it somewhat because, again,
 you never had that kind of reset to kind of work off this kind of equilibrium
 that we're talking about between buyers and sellers.
 The Santa Claus rally is the last five days of December and the first two days of January.
 So, that's that seven-day period that we're talking about for trading,
 and that starts the day after Christmas.
 So, we still have two weeks.
 So, next Friday is the 15th.
 I'm looking at a calendar, so that's why I'm not looking at the camera.
 The following Friday is the 22nd, and then we have Christmas,
 and then basically we're going to New Year's Eve on the 29th.
 So, the next two weeks leading up to the 22nd,
 that's going to be the window where if there's going to be a correction,
 it's going to happen in that window.
 If not, then this market is going to try to do whatever it wants to do.
 I mean, there's a lot of things that suggest that we don't need a big correction at this point.
 We had a big correction, obviously, in August, September, October.
 The market was down 10%.
 So, we had this outsized rally in November that was up 10%,
 basically up 9% in November.
 So, we've kind of just set ourselves back to where we were back in July.
 This is now as if the summer sell-off never even happened.
 And so, now the question is, how much further can we push the markets without some sort of reset?
 It's possible. Markets can stay overbought longer than you think.
 But if I'm a betting man and I'm managing money, which I am,
 we used this rally to raise a little bit of cash, got rid of our losers,
 we did some tax loss selling, reposition our portfolio a bit.
 And so, we're kind of expecting here a little bit of a pullback,
 100 points, 150 points, something like that on the S&P.
 And then we'll put the cash back to work for year end.
 And look, if we don't get it between now and the end of the year,
 we're going to get a correction at some point.
 The only question is, from what point is that correction and where does that correction go to?
 That's just a function of time.
 Okay. And part of the spirit of the question is just to say,
 I think folks have a general confidence every year that the Santa Claus rally is going to happen.
 I think you were generally confident about that.
 I'm going to guess maybe you're less confident now that it's going to happen.
 Not that it's not going to happen, but you're now opening yourself up to the potential
 that, "Hey, maybe we actually already got this year-end surge early
 and you're remaining defensive because you think at some point
 there is this correction that's going to happen at some point."
 Probably a mild one, but --
 Yeah. Whether or not we get the Santa Claus rally quote unquote,
 again, you have to put your expectations in line.
 I still think we're going to get a Santa Claus rally, right?
 The difference is that if we had a pullback that gave you a decent entry point,
 then your Santa Claus rally could be 2%, 3%.
 If you don't get a pullback, maybe your Santa Claus rally is a 1% rally, something like that.
 So, it's just basically degrees of what you expect the rally to be.
 Ultimately, at the end of the day, these wine markets rally or they don't rally.
 We have the January indicators, you have the NFL indicator, the football indicator,
 whoever wins the football game, all those, "So goes this, so goes the year."
 Those are all just kind of things that occur within the markets.
 And ultimately, markets are going to trend higher.
 85% of the time, markets are going higher.
 15% of the time, they're going lower.
 So, the odds are just in your favor that if you're invested, you're going to make money,
 regardless of everything else that's going on.
 Odds are you're going to make money.
 So, all we're trying to do is say, "Look, markets can't go straight up and they don't go straight down."
 Just like we saw in August, September, October.
 And remember, we go back to July.
 Actually, early June, we started writing about this very same thing.
 Markets are very overbought.
 We're going to have a correction, 3% to 5%.
 You and I were talking about this.
 It could be as much as 10%.
 And then in July, we got the correction that started in August, September, October, 10.3%.
 It was the total sell-off.
 So, I mean, right there at that limit.
 And so, here we are again.
 We're back to where we were in July and saying, "Hey, we might get a correction here."
 And that's just a function of the nature of the markets.
 They're going to correct.
 It's just a question from where do they correct and where do they correct to.
 Markets could go higher, then correct right back to where we are right now.
 And your risk reward point for putting money to work will be better than it is today, even
 though you're at the same point.
 Right.
 But because steam would have come out and you've mentioned that in videos past.
 Okay, great.
 And just to put the last nail in the coffin on this, and the point I was trying to make
 is unless the markets pull back in the relatively near future, you don't expect the Santa Claus
 rally is looking to be more and more of a non-event the longer that we just hang out
 here.
 Yeah, it could just be a mild rally.
 And look, this market can do anything.
 We're talking probabilities, yeah.
 Yeah, don't go hang your hat or whatever.
 It's like, "Well, Anthony said it's going to be a 1% rally, so it's not even worth chasing
 it."
 This market can surprise the heck out of you because there's still a lot of money sitting
 around on the sidelines.
 There's a lot of cash.
 Portfolio managers are under allocated to equities.
 They've got to catch up.
 They've got to have money in the right stocks, but they better have Google and Apple and
 Microsoft, Nvidia, AMD.
 Those stocks better be on the books at the end of the year.
 They suffer career risk.
 So, yeah, don't discount a stronger rally than what you think could happen.
 Okay.
 All right.
 Well, I'm following this path because I've got a bunch of elements on what you just talked
 about lined up here.
 One of which is this chart right here, which is basically the financial conditions index,
 which is the blue line here.
 And as it decreases, that means that it is loosening.
 And then you have the federal funds rate, which is in red there, which they're at odds
 with each other and they have been for much of the year and they're continuing to become
 more at odds as time goes on.
 And this is really interesting because we've got the federal reserve that's been hiking
 the federal funds rate and trying to tighten conditions, but the markets aren't necessarily
 going according to script here.
 And so you talked earlier about the surprise today in the unemployment rate, where it came
 in two points lower than expected at 3.7%.
 Wage growth was higher than folks expected.
 That may add some upward pressure to inflation.
 We still have sticky inflation in a couple other areas.
 So all of that potentially gives Powell more air cover to continue the higher for longer
 campaign that he has been saying he's doing.
 And of course, that could maybe disappoint the market as the market may be depending
 upon especially what the Fed says next week.
 The market may need to readjust its expectations for when the first rate cuts going to happen
 and if it pushes that out, that's another factor that could bring stocks down here.
 So I guess I'll take a pause here and let you comment here on how important is this
 continued growing disconnect between monetary policy and financial conditions?
 Look, I've been writing about this for the last, the fact that was the subject of last
 weekend's newsletter on the website as well is these looser financial conditions.
 It's a problem for the Fed.
 The whole reason the Fed hikes rates is to tighten financial conditions to bring down
 economic activity.
 And so we go back to 2010 and we talked, I can't remember how many times that you and
 I have talked about this, but Bernanke said, "Hey, we're doing QE to boost asset prices,
 to boost consumer confidence, which will help the economy grow."
 And so when financial conditions loosen, consumer sentiment improves, they go out and spend
 money that maybe they have or don't have, but they feel okay because their 401(k) has
 more money in it or their IRA has gone up in value.
 And so they feel better about taking on more credit or more debt or whatever it is because,
 "Hey, everything's fine.
 The markets are doing good.
 Economy is good.
 My job's okay."
 That's not what the Fed wants.
 And if the Fed is actually going to stop hiking rates, they need to see, and again, go back
 to what Jerome Powell said at the last minutes they came out.
 He said back in October, when they had that meeting, they said, "Look, the yields on bonds
 and the stock market are doing our job for us."
 So stocks were down, yields were up, bond prices were down, everybody was bearish.
 The whole world's going to hell in a hand basket at that point.
 And it was all about members, nobody wants our debt and it's a deficit and it's all this
 stuff.
 And so that was the doom and gloom scenario.
 And so Jerome Powell says, "Hey, great.
 This is awesome.
 Everybody's so bearish.
 They're not going to go spend money.
 That's going to help bring down inflation.
 We don't need to hike rates anymore."
 Except now when they came out and made those minutes, since they made those minutes, everybody
 was like, "Oh, wait, inflation's coming down.
 The Fed's going to cut rates in the first quarter of next year.
 This is awesome.
 Let's go run up stock prices and go run up bond prices, bring yields down."
 We were at 4.1-ish percent yesterday on the 10-year treasury.
 Let's do all that.
 What's happened since then?
 Mortgage rates have come down, mortgage applications have gone up, consumer spending is going to
 probably show an increase in improvement.
 We're seeing LEI indicators bottom and start to turn up.
 I mean, it's everything you don't want to see for slowing down economic growth, which
 is really going to put the, and this is what I've been saying for the last couple of newsletters,
 is this puts the Fed in a really tough position of coming out at this next meeting next week
 and saying, "Yeah, we're done hiking rates."
 I mean, I seriously think Jerome Powell is going to stick to his gun next week and say,
 "We can still hike if needed.
 We're watching the economic data.
 We're still concerned about inflationary pressures.
 We're not seeing what we need to see to call the coast clear."
 That's not what the market wants to hear.
 All right, so Powell is going to come out and basically say, "Don't you think I won't
 stop this car?
 Don't you think I won't turn around if you guys don't stop partying in the back?"
 Look, and he may not.
 He may just stick to his same speech that he had last Thursday, which basically said
 that.
 I mean, basically he said, "We're not done yet."
 I won't turn this car around, young man.
 Yeah, but again, we go all the way back to 2022.
 Markets would rally in 2022, then the Fed would come out and say, "Hey, we're hiking
 rates some more," and then the market would sell off.
 And then markets would just kind of arbitrarily think, "Oh, I think the Fed's done hiking
 rates here," start rallying again, and the Fed would come out and say, "Nope, beatings
 are going to continue until morale improves.
 You're not listening," and then we'd sell off again, right?
 And this has been the case for the last two years, really, in this market, and it's a
 function of what the Fed trained the markets to do over the last decade.
 You know, what we should be seeing is we should be seeing investors afraid of owning long-duration
 assets because earnings, inflation, economic growth, those type of things are at risk.
 But we don't see that.
 What we see, remember back in 2022, when the markets were selling off, I kept talking to
 you about we've got a ton of FOMO in the markets.
 Every time the market sells off, I start getting phone calls like, "Is this the bottom?
 Is this where I need to start buying equities and I need to jump in now?"
 And we've now trained investors that every dip, they've got to be buying equities.
 And as soon as the Fed cuts rates, that's going to be awesome for equities because that's
 going to loosen monetary accommodation, that stock prices are going to run up because we
 train them to do that.
 It's like Pavlov's dogs for the last 13 years.
 We've been training them that when the Fed rings the bell, buy stocks.
 And so this is why every time the market gyrates a bit, you get this FOMO rush of investors
 running back into the markets trying to hopefully catch the bottom.
 And that has some good consequences, it has some bad consequences, but this is just a
 function of the new dynamic of the market that we're in and markets are trying to fight
 the Fed tooth and nail all the way to the end game.
 Yeah.
 And what's so interesting, we've talked about this a lot, is at every point in time this
 year, the market has had to be the one to blink in this game of chicken, and yet it
 hasn't mattered.
 That's right.
 Stocks continue going higher.
 Now, I want to bring one thing up here.
 Okay, so you can see here the last time these two lines touched, the Fed funds rate and
 the financial conditions index, meaning that they were still somewhat positively correlated,
 was in April.
 That was the last Fed rate hike.
 Well, and also what that was, is that was the banking system scare.
 Actually, go back to that, that's quarter two you're clicking on, I think, which would
 be June.
 Let's see here.
 Quarter one would be January, February, March, April, May, June would be quarter two.
 Yeah, that's quarter two.
 Okay, but yeah, quarter two.
 But basically, right after that, we start sinking.
 And here's the point I want to make, which is what happened in late March, April, and
 onwards.
 We had the BTFP.
 We had the liquidity coming in to help rescue the banking system.
 Basically, what I want to say is you're right.
 The Fed totally conditioned the market that it was always going to backstop things, always
 going to be there.
 It was always going to play savior.
 But the other thing that I think this could be indicative of, Lance, which you and I talk
 an awful lot about is liquidity.
 There are times where we've sort of thrown up our hands and just said, "Hey, does all
 the pontificating really not matter and all we have to do is just watch net liquidity
 flows?
 Will that just basically tell the tale?"
 And that is a pretty compelling argument.
 And so we had this year, we had the BTFP launch right around then, the last time when they
 started to deviate.
 We've had the reverse repo market getting drained, which I want to talk with you a little
 bit about in a bit.
 And so I literally just got a DM this morning from Sven Henrich, a very exasperated one
 just saying, "Hey, remember back in March where we just said it's really all about liquidity?"
 He's like, "I think it's the same thing here that's just driving everything around here."
 So I do want to note that I've got Michael Howell, who I interviewed at the very beginning
 of this year about liquidity.
 He tracks that very closely.
 He's got his own sort of special way of measuring it.
 I know you do too as well, Lance, but he's going to be on this program in two weeks,
 I think, folks.
 So we'll get an update from him on what's going on there.
 But my question to you, Lance, is despite the monetary tightening with these different
 vehicles, the BTFP draining the reverse repo, all the deficit spending that's been happening
 this year on the fiscal side, could that be just sort of explaining to this discrepancy
 here where the conditions are just getting looser because there's a lot more sort of
 shadow liquidity out there than most folks realize?
 No, absolutely, and federal expenditures continue to increase.
 I think we did this chart right here.
 I think we talked about this last week to some degree that federal expenditures, regardless
 of everything else that you think is going on, has just continued to increase.
 So this is -- Yeah, that's right.
 Yeah, pull this back up.
 And as you're talking to it, just see if you can address the question of will Powell stop
 his tightening campaign while the conditions are this loose or will these conditions need
 to tighten to be able to give Powell the ability to finally win the inflation battle?
 No, that's the million dollar question.
 I've been talking to a lot of people lately.
 I just had a conversation with a very notable economist this morning and who's coming down
 to speak at the event in January that you're going to come down for.
 He'll be there to talk about next year and what to expect.
 But he's like, look, he says, when you take a look at the economy, the economy is doing
 just fine and there's plenty of liquidity still in the system.
 People still have money to spend.
 Yes, it's tightening up, but there's still excess savings.
 There's still lots of monetary liquidity coming in from different angles.
 There's a lot of money sitting in money market accounts right now.
 So there's dry powder, so to speak, to help support spending and economic growth.
 But also to just federal expenditures, we're running a two trillion dollar deficit and
 we're not really in a war.
 I mean, now we've got some wars going on that we're helping fund like Ukraine and Israel,
 but we're not directly involved.
 We're not directly involved in a war effort at the moment and we're running a two trillion
 dollar deficit.
 So, you know, that's just all this other spending that we've got going on inside of the government
 that continues to feed into economic growth.
 And that's what this chart is.
 You see real, you know, you see kind of see the real gross domestic product.
 We just clipped five point two percent growth in the third quarter.
 Now, fourth quarter is going to slow down and that's kind of what we expected.
 But it's still it's still running probably one point two to one point five somewhere
 around there.
 So still a positive growth.
 And that's just because of this, you know, continued increase of federal spending that
 we've got going on.
 It's just moving into the system.
 So you take a look at M2 as a percentage of GDP, it's still extremely elevated.
 You know, we talk about that pig in the python.
 There's still a lot of pig left in that python that hasn't come through yet.
 And so, you know, will it eventually come out?
 Absolutely.
 Is it going to be in 2024?
 Maybe not.
 Maybe, you know, the real slowdown occurs in twenty twenty five.
 Maybe it's twenty twenty six.
 We really don't know where the end of that runway is because we keep coming up with new
 ways to spend money or find money or whatever it is.
 Right.
 Interesting to see that.
 And we talked about consumers.
 Right.
 Good example is an article out this past week took a survey of all these buy now pay later
 firms that have sprung up since twenty twenty two ish right after the financial after the
 pandemic.
 Those have record borrowings right now.
 People are flooding to these buy now pay later firms because, you know, you can buy something,
 you know, you make you got payments over four or eight or twelve months, whatever it is.
 And, you know, that's just a function of people, again, talked about before consumers are very
 adept at finding new ways to get access to money.
 And so they're fleeing, they're kind of flat.
 I can't get any more of my credit card, so I'll go take it out on these buy now pay later
 programs.
 Yeah.
 And I'm not even sure we could we should make that assumption because that's my initial
 assumption, too, is, oh, my God, people are so desperate.
 All they can do now is the buy now pay later stuff.
 But buy now pay later.
 I think people might be choosing that over putting it on a credit card, even if they
 have a credit card option.
 And the reason for that is buy now pay later.
 It doesn't charge it charges you, I think, lower financing fees than most credit cards
 do.
 Now, the problem is, is if you miss a payment, then the penalty fees that come into that
 are can be pretty rapacious.
 Right.
 But I think it's consumers just following the incentives, right, where it's like, oh,
 it's cheaper borrowing that I don't have to actually pay today.
 Great.
 I'm going to do it.
 I think it's a massive ticking time bomb.
 I think that, you know, we're going to see in a year or two, you know, a lot of these
 buy now pay later companies be in real trouble if not go out of business and folks will say,
 my gosh, that was a terrible idea.
 How do we ever go along with it?
 But right now, people are just being people, right?
 But that's my whole point.
 It doesn't matter why they're doing it.
 It's a function.
 They are doing it.
 Right.
 You get credit card, you know, credit, you know, the ability to take out credit cards.
 Those are reaching limits where, you know, we've seen just a massive surge of that.
 So, you know, but again, this has been my whole point for a while is got to be don't
 count the consumer out, right.
 Is it, you know, yeah, inflation's high, housing prices are high, gas price or whatever.
 But man, consumers, they're built to spend and they're trained to spend money and that's
 all society is built around is go spend more money.
 Okay.
 This is a great point.
 And it's not just consumers, it's the whole system that is trying to preserve the status
 quo.
 So that's what you're going up against if you are taking the contrary position, which
 I generally am inclined to take, but I agree, we got to be very, very cautious right now
 about the assumptions we're making.
 And what's so interesting about this, Lance, is there are probably two things that the
 people I bring on this channel now I'm seeing, they agree about a lot of things, but here
 are the things I think they disagree on the most.
 One is what's going to happen with bond yields next year.
 That's number one.
 But the second one is this, are we headed into a recession?
 Maybe we're already in one versus, hey, things are actually chugging along better than a
 lot of people are giving credit for and this economy and the consumer could be stronger
 for a lot longer than many people expect.
 So I just interviewed in two great points, my past two interviews on this channel, Danielle
 DiMartino Booth, she's much more worried about deflation next year and recession, all that
 federal expenditure that you were just talking about, Lance.
 She thinks the two things, one, she says, "Look, the money that really matters is the
 money that's been going directly to consumers and getting directly out in the economy."
 She's like, "That spigot is fully shut off and going forward, the fiscal spending is
 going to get harder because Congress is becoming even more divided and new speaker of the house
 and the Republican side, they're going to do everything they can to try to thwart the
 administration going into next year's elections."
 Then right before her, I interviewed Wolf Richter, who publishes a ton of data, a lot
 of charts on his website and he said two things, he said, "First off, I think we need a recession."
 He's like, "Hands down, I agree we need one.
 They're healthy.
 We've been putting it at bay for way too long.
 We need a recession."
 He's like, "I just don't see it in the data."
 And he said, "The consumer is actually doing really pretty well when you look at recent
 increases in wages and how consumer spending is holding up and I was pushing back on certain
 things like the explosion and revolving credit."
 And he's like, "Yeah, but you know what?
 The majority of that gets paid off every month.
 Not that many people are carrying balances," which by the way, folks led to an explosion
 of emails to me and I went back and forth with Wolf on it.
 He's got a couple of really interesting articles on his wolfstreet.com.
 If you want to dig more deeply into the data behind that claim that he made, there is a
 logic behind it, so you can go to his website and check it out.
 But basically, Wolf is just saying, "I'd be the first one to say, I think there's a recession
 coming if I saw it in the data because I think we should have a recession."
 But he's like, "I just don't see the worrying signs yet.
 I don't see the default yet."
 The subprime has a little bit of problems, but it always does.
 That's why it's called subprime.
 There's no major toppling dominoes right now that makes him think a recession should happen
 in the first half of next year or longer.
 So to your point, we just need to be cautious about whatever --
 Yeah, look, there's a ton of data out there that -- Actually, let me back that up.
 There's a ton of indicators out there, inverted yield curve, leading economic indicators,
 etc., that all say a recession is going to occur, and we've written about this before
 and the problem is always the timing and there's so much, again, I agree with Wolf, there's
 so much money in the system, no matter how you break it down, you look at M2, you look
 at GDP, you look at household savings rates, those type of things, there's so much money
 sitting out there that it could potentially, as I said, we may not get a recession in 2024,
 it could be 2025, it could be 2026.
 It's hard to imagine, but Lance, these indicators are always right about a recession and that's
 true, they are until they're not and look, they've never been wrong before, but it doesn't
 mean that this time because -- And again, the way you have to look at this is that what
 we did in 2020 was so abnormal, right?
 We artificially shut down the economy, we created a recession in 2020 and then we just
 flooded households with cash, we've never done that, right?
 We never sent $5 trillion worth of money directly to households and then provide all these other
 benefits and add-ons and everything else.
 So we've skewed the data so badly that when you start looking at things and going, well,
 we should have a recession, you got to be a little cautious with that.
 Let me give you a good example.
 Here, let me see.
 Hold on a second.
 Let me just grab this chart real fast because I think this will kind of explain a little
 bit of why everybody has this conundrum going on right now.
 Look, I'm right there with everybody else.
 This doesn't really make a lot of sense, but this is exactly what should be happening.
 We should be having this recession, et cetera.
 Bear with me one second here.
 Let me get this chart.
 Sure.
 As you're pulling it up, I'm going to ask a question that maybe you can address in your
 answer as you speak to it, which is you use the rubber band analogy an awful lot, right?
 So if we pull the rubber band further than we've ever pulled it before, right?
 It should snap back at some point.
 And my question is, every snap back, it doesn't just snap back to the average.
 There's usually an overcorrection, right?
 So should we expect, if we had unprecedented record stimulus, should we expect at some
 point, maybe not next year, but at some point, an unusually large period of slow growth because
 we overstimulated so much, like do the scales need to balance like that?
 Yeah.
 And the question though is that what level do they start to balance?
 And so this is my point.
 So take a look at this chart.
 So this is GDP quarterly change at an annual rate, right?
 So this is how we measure GDP.
 So 5.2% growth in quarter three.
 We didn't really grow at 5.2%.
 That's taking one fourth of that number.
 That's what actually occurred in quarter four or quarter three, and then we multiply it
 for a year.
 So we multiply.
 You annualize it.
 Yeah.
 That's the annual rate.
 So that's what this chart is.
 So you say, well, we've got to have this recession.
 Okay, well, what's a recession?
 That's negative annual growth, okay?
 That's a recession.
 But we have to go back and look and look at this spike that we had follow 2020.
 So in March of 2020, we shut down the economy.
 The economy drops by 8% at an annual rate.
 Then we flood the system with this liquidity and the economy surges 12% at an annual rate.
 So that's a 20% reversion in GDP with all that money, right?
 So we had this massive surge in economic growth.
 Well, we've now corrected a big chunk of that.
 We almost got back to 0% growth before this little rally at an annual rate.
 So we've actually declined by 12% growth in the economy.
 Now, at any other time in history, if we were at 2% or 3% or 4% growth and then declined
 by 12%, we'd be in a recession, right?
 But because we never got below zero, we didn't have a recession.
 But the economy still slowed by 12%.
 So kind of in theory, if you're driving along at 20 miles an hour and then you hit a brick
 wall and you stop, but you don't go through the brick wall, you know, that's all that's
 happened to the economy is that we just came to a stop basically and have now started to
 kind of revert that big decline that we had.
 So again, you know, in any normal time, the decline in economic activity that we saw would
 have been recessionary.
 But because we were starting from such a high level, we never actually triggered that recession.
 So that's the one kind of conundrum that lays out there.
 Look, I'm not saying that we're not going to turn around and drop into negative territory.
 It's just we screwed up the data so much with all that stimulus, we've never had a spike
 like that before.
 And so reverting that spike has occurred, it just didn't drag into negative territory
 yet.
 And I'm not saying that it won't.
 I'm just saying you have to consider the fact that maybe the recession occurred, but it
 wasn't an actual recession.
 Okay, let me just get this note down.
 Lance Roberts says no recessions ever again in his lifetime.
 Okay.
 Exactly.
 No, that's not what I'm saying.
 No, no, no.
 Good point.
 I mean, it's a good point, right?
 Which is, I mean, we have come down an awful lot from that mountaintop, right?
 And even though we didn't quite go negative, it's an unprecedented almost drop from 12%
 to almost near 0%.
 In fact, in that data series, I don't think we ever saw a drop that much, right?
 Okay.
 So a couple of things on this still.
 One is, I just want to underscore a point I made earlier, which adds to your point about
 like, hey, remember consumers, they're going to do whatever they can, they're going to
 find all sorts of creative ways to game the system, right?
 To keep getting money to spend.
 And so they're going to keep their spending going as much as they humanly possibly can,
 you know, to the point where like, you know, people are selling organs and all that type
 of stuff, right?
 They can be very, very creative, especially when they get desperate.
 But on the other side, right, on the policy side, on the corporate side, you just have
 absolutely everybody who benefits from the status quo, laser focused on trying to make
 sure that the status quo keeps happening, right?
 So for the recession to happen, the forces have to get big enough that they overpower
 the collective forces of those trying to keep the status quo going.
 And that's a big battle, right?
 That just doesn't happen generally overnight, right?
 So this thing could, my point is, this could last a lot longer than a lot of bears, myself
 included, could think possible, right?
 Not saying it is going to last that long, but it could.
 Now, let's get to some potential forecasting here, right?
 I just interviewed Felix Zulauf, fantastic interview.
 Felix is great, because he's very articulate.
 He's highly respected because his track record has been phenomenal.
 And whether or not this is what's going to happen, Felix laid out very clearly what he
 thinks is going to happen over the next couple of years.
 Folks, you definitely want to watch that video.
 If you're watching this the day this video comes out, it hasn't launched yet, but it
 will launch the next day on Sunday.
 If you're watching this video a day after it's released, the Felix interview is already
 out there in the world, you should go watch it.
 But basically what he says, Lance, is he thinks the economy is going to power higher through
 Q1 and it's going to look stronger than it does now, and that that's going to get people
 continued excited that, "Hey, forget soft landing, no landing.
 We're all good here."
 And the markets he thinks will power higher into Q1.
 So he's not making these exact predictions, but he says, "I wouldn't be surprised to see
 the S&P at like 5,000."
 He thinks that's going to be the peak.
 He then thinks that the lag effects are going to catch up.
 The wheels are going to start coming off and he sees the markets declining potentially
 pretty substantially next year, potentially as low as 3,000 on the S&P.
 So that's a 40% correction potential in the S&P.
 Folks, if you want to understand all of Felix's reasons why, go watch that video.
 But so in his view, the current strength that we're seeing, probably the last fumes, if
 you will, but they could continue for another quarter or so, probably break a lot of the
 existing bears' stamina, get a lot of capitulation from them, get everybody back on the like,
 "Okay, we're in Goldilocks world now, train," only to then pull the rug out from underneath
 all of them.
 Not saying that's going to happen, just saying a very smart, very experienced long-term investor.
 That's his outlook for right now.
 So to your point, Lance, it's tricky time, right?
 Because if you are expecting a recession and whatnot next year, you look into the data
 right now, it does not look like it's coming close.
 So you may want to play this game for a bit, but there's still lots of things out there.
 And you gave a litany of them earlier that still show that, "Hey, there's a lot of recessionary
 indicators out there."
 And they very well, at some point, might come into their full expression and could catch
 a lot of people who are overextended on the long side.
 So I understand, particularly in your world where you have to play this game because you've
 got client capital to manage, but you got to be prudent while you're doing it at the
 same time.
 Right?
 Yeah.
 No, that's right.
 And this is something that we actually just talked about in Tuesday's article on our website,
 talking about looking at next year and analysts are always very optimistic.
 In fact, right now you're getting all the Wall Street optimism kind of out in the markets.
 I always think it's interesting because I write this article pretty much every year.
 And it's interesting because last year we lay out a range of predictions and we said
 that based on a multiple expansion scenario, the markets would end at about $45.50.
 And that's exactly where the markets are.
 So I mean, almost to the to the point of what we laid out last year has actually come out
 to be the case.
 Now, again, there's also bearish predictions in there as well, because you have to account
 for recession, you know, margin contraction, those type of things.
 And so we just went through this exercise again here, I'll share a couple of screens
 with you, you know, as we start thinking about next year.
 And I don't disagree with what Zou off to say, because, again, you just don't know what
 next year is going to bring.
 But I think it was interesting, because this was in 2022, sorry, 2021.
 Going into 2022, Goldman Sachs said that the market was going to climb 9% to 5100.
 Now that was 5100 in 2021, right?
 Turned out that the market ended the year at 3839.
 So this is why Goldman guys get paid the big bucks.
 Exactly.
 Well, this is the whole point of the article, which is be careful, you know, who you listen
 to, because analysts are always paid to be optimistic, I'll explain to you why.
 And I just wrote an article about why that's the case that was last weekend's newsletter.
 Going through you as a retail investor, you should never listen to Wall Street, because
 they're there to sell your product.
 When you look at who compensates Wall Street, retail is at the very bottom of the list,
 they can care less about you, because all that Goldman wants to do is sell your product.
 So they're always optimistic because they want to sell their investment banking services
 to their clients, which are the corporations.
 So this is the problem of Wall Street.
 Anyway, I'm going to interject just for one second, there's an important point you're
 touching on here too, which is, it's not just Wall Street.
 So Wall Street, obviously, their incentive is to line their own pockets.
 But it's the financial media in many ways.
 And I get this an awful lot from folks who are coming to this channel, because they're
 so disenfranchised and disappointed by the mainstream financial media, because who pays
 it is the advertisers whose products Wall Street is selling.
 That's why you see every segment of CNBC, this ad sponsored by Spider ETFs or Alliance
 mutual funds or whatever.
 That's why in CNBC, no matter what the market has done, it's always a good time to buy stocks.
 So I just want to underscore your point.
 It's not just Wall Street pressuring you this.
 It's the media also telling you the same false story, potentially false story, but definitely
 biased story.
 Exactly.
 So Wall Street end of the year targets for this year was an average of 4,000.
 We're 500 points above that.
 So again, this is the problem with these and this is what analysts always think would happen,
 what versus happened.
 This is why you really, you have to do your own homework and you've got to be realistic
 and you've got to, you know, whenever you and again, this is why I tell you, you know,
 so if you listen to it, you know, look, you just had a really good point, counterpoint
 discussion between Daniel DiMartino Booth and Wolf Richter, right, Daniel, recession
 coming next year.
 Okay.
 I need to be in the bunker.
 I need to be all in cash because we have a recession.
 That's bad for stocks.
 Wolf saying, hey, maybe not the case.
 So again, you've got to take both of those arguments and weigh them and then make your
 assumptions and that's the whole point of this article is to go through that exercise
 and say, look, right now, next year, 2024 targets are back to 5,100.
 What Goldman said basically two years ago, we're now going to be at the same spot two
 years later, right?
 So keep that in mind.
 Earnings for next year expected to climb to 220.
 Now those earnings have already come down by $7 from the original estimate.
 So they were even more bullish to start with, but those earnings estimates are starting
 to come down, but we're still at 220 a share that'd be up from 184.95.
 This is according to S&P earnings from quarter three.
 We don't have quarter four yet.
 So but those are expected to come in right around 190 ish, 190, 191 for fourth quarter.
 So earnings growth next year, that suggests that stocks should trade higher next year
 because earnings are going higher.
 So let's do some math and this is the point of the exercise.
 Take everything you're hearing and throw it in the garbage and do your homework.
 All you have to do is understand valuations at the end of the day.
 Where do you assume valuations will be next year?
 Let's make some assumptions.
 So the only thing we have to work with right now is $220 a share in earnings to quarter
 four.
 So we're going to use that as our baseline because that's what we have right now.
 Those are the estimates.
 So now my opinion is, is those estimates are going to come down.
 We're probably going to be closer to 200, 205 probably by the end of next year, but
 we'll see when we get there.
 But assuming 220, if we assume no recession, so let's go with Wolf and say no recession
 next year.
 If we have no recession, we should probably estimate that valuations would remain about
 where they are, about 22 times earnings, which would mean that based on 22 times earnings,
 the market should trade at 4,845 next year.
 And sorry to interrupt, just to interject, 2200 PE ratio is elevated.
 We just want to make sure that folks realize that we are, but it's been about the average
 over the last several years, right?
 We've been trading elevated for quite a long time.
 Back prior to 2000, as an example, the average PE ratio was around 13, 14 times earnings.
 That was the average going back to 1900.
 Since 2000, we've been trading at elevated valuations.
 That average PE ratio is now 19, right?
 So that's just, we've been trading above long-term historical norms for a very long time.
 So at 22 times earnings, that's about, as you can see, that's kind of about where we've
 been over the last several years.
 So in that environment, if we assume no recession, the market and the economy just kind of chugs
 along, nothing fantastic, then you're at 4,845, so it's about a 300-point advance from where
 we are right now.
 But let's assume a soft landing.
 So let's assume that Danielle's right and we have a, now, and one of the reasons I say
 soft landing is I want to differentiate between just a normal recession and a financial crisis.
 Because when you mention recession now, everybody immediately assumes a 50% market decline.
 We're going to have, you know, everybody's going to be living on the street and so be
 this massive financial crisis.
 We don't have any of the ingredients for a financial crisis.
 Right.
 And you showed that awesome chart the other week that showed the probability of a financial
 crisis.
 It's a super tail risk, right?
 It's like 3% or something like that.
 Not that they don't happen, but they do not happen often.
 Yeah.
 Exactly.
 But let's assume a recession.
 And in a recession, you would expect evaluation reversion back to probably the long term average,
 which would be around 17 times earnings.
 That puts you at 3,744.
 So there's Zuloft's argument, give or take, right?
 Yeah.
 Maybe a little bit more.
 It could be a little bit more.
 It could be a little bit less, whatever.
 But just assume that's his thesis.
 So there's your Zuloft argument.
 And those are perfectly valid, right?
 If we look at long, if we look at the long term historical norms of historical recessions
 and market declines, a decline of 3,744 from current levels would be about an 18% decline.
 That's well within the norms of what happens during a recession.
 Could be a little bit more, could be a little bit less, but well within the normality of
 what would occur during a recession.
 So we have a recession, an 18 to 20% decline, completely normal.
 You should expect that.
 So now we've got two possibilities.
 We've got a maintained valuation normal.
 Everything's fine.
 Economy kind of grows.
 Now we've got a recession scenario.
 So we've got two outcomes potentially, one bullish, one bearish.
 Now, one thing that we know is that when the Fed hikes rates and they start to cut rates
 that normally markets don't do as well.
 Maybe this time is different because of liquidity.
 We'll see.
 But it's something that we have to certainly consider.
 But now we also need to step back.
 We need a bullish scenario.
 We've got to be thinking, hey, markets always tend to do stuff you don't expect.
 So let's come up with a bullish scenario and say we have another year like we had this
 year where you have a margin expansion year.
 So what is margin expansion?
 That's where earnings don't really grow that much.
 Maybe we go to $220 a share, maybe, whatever it is.
 But we even pay up more for those earnings.
 We think that the world is doing great and we're willing to pay even more for forward
 earnings than what they're really worth, which is what we've been doing for the last two
 years, by the way.
 So we have to have this margin expansion idea in there because it's possible the markets
 could pay up more for an expectation that, hey, it's a soft landing, we're going to get
 through it.
 And then 2025 is going to be gangbusters.
 We're going to be off to the races.
 Profit margins are going to grow, et cetera.
 So let's assume that we go from twenty four times earnings now to twenty four and a half
 times earnings.
 Not a big increase in margin expansion, but at twenty four and a half times earnings by
 the end of next year, you're talking about fifty three hundred fifty four hundred technically
 on the S&P.
 Now, again, this is just based on valuations.
 I'm not saying we're going to go to fifty one fifty four hundred.
 I'm saying based on valuations, that's where you would expect it to be.
 And when we did this analysis last year, this same this was the bullish outcome for last
 year and it pegged it right at forty five fifty.
 Right.
 Right.
 But where markets are trading now.
 Got it.
 Yeah.
 You can't discount those bullish narratives.
 And so here's here's the point of this whole exercise.
 We put all this together.
 We say, look, here's where the market's trading.
 Now, look, this was last Thursday I wrote this article.
 So we don't have the latest price movement in here, but you get the idea.
 But you know, you put this on a range of outcomes.
 There's your range of outcomes for next year.
 Now, how do you build your portfolio to navigate that range of outcomes?
 That's the only question you need to worry about.
 All the other narratives are B.S.
 Just throw them out the window.
 They're not they're not even relevant.
 Just understand what your ranges are.
 How do I manage a portfolio risk structured so that I can I can mitigate my downside potential
 if that would occur.
 David Zulof is right, Danielle's right, that's your downside, how do I navigate that?
 But at the same time, how do I also participate if we have these better outcomes than what
 expected?
 Because that's certainly what happened in twenty twenty three because everybody thought
 it was going to be a terrible year this year.
 In twenty twenty two, they thought it would be great and it wasn't.
 So you have to always look at what the outcomes could be and manage that risk reward profile
 accordingly.
 OK, so that is the question.
 And I know the answer isn't a simple one and it's kind of different for every client.
 And again, this is why I keep beating the drum on this channel to work with a good professional
 financial adviser who takes all the things that Lance and I are talking about here into
 consideration.
 But Lance, as the portfolio manager, can you give us a distilled sense of how you are planning
 on positioning for that?
 Well, this is why we talk about risk management every week.
 We talk about technicals.
 We talk about this.
 I don't need to worry about what's going to happen between now and December of next year
 because nobody knows.
 That's the whole point of the exercise.
 Nobody knows what's going to happen.
 And every year the analysts are wrong.
 So and as we talked about before, if you're going, well, I think, you know, I think next
 year is going to be this terrible bear market, I'm going to put all my money into cash.
 That's not going to work out well for you.
 You know, most likely it may be well, but most likely it won't.
 You know, there's you know, this is why you just have to manage your portfolio from one
 week to the next and say, OK, what's changing?
 Is something changing?
 Do I need to be aware of that?
 I need to reposition.
 I want to add exposure or reduce exposure because you're sailing uncharted waters.
 Nobody knows what's going to happen next year.
 Nobody can be can predict what's going to happen.
 We just have to sell the waters that we're in and navigate accordingly.
 OK, so let me share two things because I want to make this really personal for folks, too.
 So one, Felix again goes into much more detail in terms of what he's doing, but given the
 arc that he laid out there, we didn't talk about his outlook for bonds yet.
 And I still want to ask you a little bit about the bonds market, too, before we're done here,
 Lance.
 But Felix is basically saying he's light long going into Q1, right?
 So he thinks there's still some more juice left in this market run, but he's not chasing
 after it aggressively.
 He's just basically sitting in a lot of short term cash equivalents that are paying him
 a nice yield.
 And then he is going to go short if you start seeing the indicators that he expects.
 And he does plan to play the short drop in the market.
 I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I would say, I would say aggressively, but
 he'll be in it.
 He'll be in it to capture some return on that market correction if it indeed happens.
 Now in his mind, though, the big opportunity comes after the correction, the dust settles,
 because that's when he expects the big central bank rescue, and he expects asset prices to
 shoot the moon over the next two years, largely driven by all the liquidity and stimulus getting
 pumped into the system.
 Now who knows if that's going to happen or not, but that is his playbook should that
 happen.
 Okay.
 I'm running out of time quickly here again, so let me --
 By the way, I've got one topic I want to hit on before we finish out.
 I need about five minutes.
 Oh, God.
 All right.
 If you need five minutes, then we're going to punt the rant again for yet another week,
 but that's okay.
 You'll appreciate this one is actually a good rant because it was a Gallup poll and a Wall
 Street Journal poll that got me fired up this weekend.
 Okay, good.
 I'm glad you're fired up about it.
 So real quick, where to start?
 Okay, first, let me just pull this up here.
 So I put this out on Twitter the other day just asking, "Hey, have we seen the peak in
 bond yields?"
 Generated a lot of discussion.
 I'll be super transparent with Felix Zulauf.
 He feels that rates will probably keep heading downward from here.
 What I love about him is in his predictions.
 He's willing to kind of be specific about the targets he's looking for.
 He could see them going down to about 3.7 by Q1 when we're at the peak Goldilocks.
 He then thinks as we start getting into trouble, he could see yields jumping back up.
 We're talking about 10-year US treasury yields here, potentially up to like the five, five
 and a half percent range, and then potentially decreasing as low as 3% by the end of next
 year.
 That said, he's not going big on the bond trade like you and Mike Leibowitz are, Lance.
 He's saying, "Ah, there's enough uncertainty in that that I just don't want to be put in
 danger of getting that call wrong."
 But I know you and Mike Leibowitz, again, you've been very transparent and we've talked
 an awful lot about your bond outlook here.
 But I'm curious, do you think that the peak in yields is in for the cycle?
 The peak is probably in, there's not really a driver to push yields back up to five.
 So again, what drives yields is inflation and economic growth.
 So unless you get a massive surge in economic growth and inflation jumps back up to 6, 7%,
 then yields are probably where they need to be.
 When yields were at five, those were overvalued relative to where inflation was at 3.9 at
 the time, and economic growth is still around two and a half to three.
 So that all argues that yields will come lower.
 But the day before yesterday, I sold it, so I have a personal bond trade that's going
 on and Mike has a personal trade going on with option calls.
 Day before yesterday, he closed out his calls and I sold a third of my bond position.
 The reason is, is that yields have come down too far, too fast or they're aggressively
 overbought here and as we're seeing today because of this employment number, our assumption
 is that we're going to get some economic data that comes out stronger than expected.
 The Fed is probably going to give you some message next week that they're not ready to
 cut rates yet.
 That's going to pull yield back up and that'll give us a better opportunity to add back into
 those positions and we'll do that.
 So we're looking for maybe a pullback around four, five, four, six, four, seven on the
 ten-year treasury and somewhere in there, then I'm going to buy back those shares that
 I sold.
 This is on my personal account, not my climate accounts, so it's clear.
 By the way, is Mike pulling into the office in a new Lamborghini these days?
 No, not yet.
 Those trades are working very, very well and I think that, look, if you're in Daniel De
 Martino Boost Camp and you're expecting a recession, buying yields are going to do great
 because even in a slow economic environment, inflation gets down to 2%, economic growth
 goes to 2%, which is what the Fed wants, then interest rates will be 2%.
 So it's just a bunch.
 And just to pull transparency, so Danielle thinks that deflation is going to be the problem
 next year.
 So she's in David Rosenberg's camp that will actually see less than 2% inflation, maybe
 1% handle or in Daniel's case, maybe even negative at some point.
 And then if you see that, then the Fed is starting to aggressively intervene, then yields
 are going to go to 1% or less.
 Okay.
 So if they're right, that's where we go.
 To be clear with Felix, where he expects 3% ish by the end of this washout on the tenure
 at the end of next year, he then for the next couple of years, sees his bond yields going
 to the moon because he thinks that the central bank rescue efforts will be highly inflationary
 and that bond yields are going to have to sort of compensate for that.
 Yeah, that's not actually correct at all.
 Because if you go back and look at a chart between 2010 and 2013, where we had $43 trillion
 worth of government interventions, the only one of those that created inflation was checks
 to households.
 So as long as the Fed's doing QE and keeping rates at zero, that's actually deflationary
 for rates, and that's going to keep rates near the zero bound because that's what the
 Fed wants.
 And so they're going to make sure they push those long-term rates lower.
 So that's not the worry.
 Now if he's expecting the government to step in and start doing MMT again, then yeah, you're
 going to have inflation and rates are going higher.
 Yeah.
 I think he may be, to be honest, I don't think I pressed into him because I was more focused
 on the year coming, not multiple years out, because as you said many times, that's just
 all postulating.
 So I don't know exactly what's in his forecast, but I'm guessing it is.
 And like I agree with you, Lance, you get out too far, nobody knows what's going to
 happen, but I'm going to let you be the one to call Felix Zulafrong.
 I'm not going to call him one.
 No, I'm just saying if he's saying that just Fed intervention alone, which is QE.
 I hear what you're saying.
 And Danielle said the same thing.
 I think we all agree is, yeah, that doesn't get out into the wild, nearly have the inflationary
 effect that direct money to consumer households has.
 Problem is, is we've opened that Pandora's box and that's exactly what they'll be asking
 for.
 They'll be demanding that.
 And that'll be won't matter who's in charge of the house or the Senate, it won't matter.
 Yeah.
 I'm talking quickly here because I'm trying to get to your deadline.
 So I talked with this conversation with Danielle, the reverse repo market and for folks don't
 know what that is, we define it in depth in the discussion with Danielle, but essentially
 it has been providing liquidity to the system as a reverse repo has been basically getting
 drained.
 On the current trajectory that it is being drained, it should be basically empty by end
 of Q1 ish next year.
 How substantial is that, Lance?
 It's an issue.
 I don't think it's a crisis type issue at some point, because again, we had a reverse
 repo issue back in 2019 and this is where rates had gone to like 8% for overnight borrowing
 and we were bailing out hedge funds and all those type of things.
 And then that all got fixed in 2020 when the Fed stepped in massive liquidity.
 So if there's a warning sign that you're looking for that maybe there's, and again, let's go
 back and this is one thing that Mike and I have been very clear about.
 If the Fed is going to become more dovish at the next meeting, that is going to be because
 they see something that we don't see happen in the credit markets.
 So if this reverse repo issue is leading to some form of financial instability within
 the banking system, then we may see them become much more dovish.
 And that would be a really good clue if they come out next week considering what's been
 happening with the markets, with the bond market, what's been happening with the economic
 data.
 If they come out next week and kind of tilt more dovish like, "Hey, we're probably good
 on hiking rates, we're probably restrictive enough," and they kind of pull that one more
 rate hike off the table, that's probably a pretty good indication that there's some stress
 in the financial system that we're not openly aware of and maybe that's what reverse repo
 is telling us.
 Right.
 So the markets would cheer that but the same person like you and me would say, "I actually
 kind of worries us because it means they're scared of something."
 Yeah.
 Right.
 But that also means that we're one step closer to the Fed bailing something out too.
 Yeah.
 But again, everybody thinks, "Oh, the Fed starts the bailout and then asset prices shoot
 the moon."
 But the history shows that no, no, no, your quarters of the Fed desperately cutting rates
 while the market continues to sink as we fall into recession.
 Be careful with that because remember, we've been training investors now for a decade.
 We've been ringing that bell for a decade and before they're like, "Oh, panic, something's
 breaking."
 Now they're starting, even we saw this in 2020, March 2020, markets are down 35%.
 We're shutting down the economy and markets start rallying because the Fed's bailing everything
 out.
 Right?
 Yeah.
 Although I can't remember how quickly they announced all the other stuff too.
 It all happened in March.
 The Fed bailed everything out in March and by April, the markets are rallying.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Oh, good.
 Okay.
 So it might be different this time given how we've conditioned everybody.
 I'm not saying that's the case.
 I'm just saying be aware that when we look back at history, yeah, when the Fed cuts rates,
 you don't want to be long stocks, you want to buy stocks when the Fed stops cutting rates,
 that's your moment.
 Right?
 And all I'm saying is that now after a decade of training people on monetary interventions,
 they now know, "Oh, QE, good for stocks.
 QE, buy stocks.
 Right?
 Ring the bell.
 Buy stocks.
 Ring the bell.
 Buy stocks."
 Now we don't have to ring the bell.
 It's just like, "Hey, we might cut rates.
 Buy stocks."
 Yeah.
 We've just been training people for that now for a decade and it's now starting to just
 become habit.
 Okay.
 I think one of the points Danielle was making about when the reverse repo becomes empty
 is she said that that's sort of been an offset to the Fed's QT and so with that gone, then
 the full effect of QT is going to start to be felt.
 So it sounds like you think that that's something worth keeping on.
 Okay.
 No, it is.
 Look, this goes back to liquidity and why do we have such a big run in the market over
 the last month?
 We had a massive surge in liquidity over the last month.
 So you take the Fed balance sheet minus the TGA general account reverse repo, that liquidity
 shot up dramatically and that all just fed into the market.
 So if we're going to see another downturn in the markets, we need to see that liquidity
 reverse.
 Well, and that's why I'm so interested about the upcoming interview with Michael Howell
 because I want to see what his forecast for liquidity is.
 All right.
 So I want to get your trades in just a second real quick.
 I just want to note for folks that apparently the penalty for underpayment of your federal
 taxes has more than doubled over the past two years.
 It used to be 3%.
 It's now 8%.
 So just noting for folks as we're heading into the end of the year and last week, Lance
 shared some of the things that you should be doing right now considering for end of
 year planning.
 One thing you should be looking at real closely is, hey, have I been making, especially if
 you're a gig employee, you're self-employed, you receive big bonuses or you have substantial
 investment income, and a lot of people have a lot more investment income this year than
 they've had in previous years.
 Sit down with your accountant real quick and just do an assessment of whether you may need
 to be sending some estimated taxes into the government sooner versus waiting later given
 these big penalties.
 All right, with that said, Lance trades, have you guys made any recent trades?
 None this week.
 Okay.
 We've already done it, this is the same as last week, we've done our tasks while selling.
 That's two weeks.
 So we're just waiting for the market to give us some type of correction here that we can
 buy into.
 Okay.
 All right.
 So again, waiting for some softness in prices to start deploying more stuff in.
 Or just simply time, right?
 Right.
 Let it grind off the overbought.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 That's all we're waiting for.
 You're just waiting for a better opportunity to put some money to it.
 Okay.
 All right.
 We got your five minutes for your rant here.
 All right.
 So look, last week here, let me just share a screen with you quick.
 This is an article on our website as of today.
 This came out actually on Friday, sorry, came on Friday and it's talking about the American
 dream and this is one of my, and Adam and I have talked about capitalism and the benefits
 capitalism and those types of things for a while and I just, when I see these surveys
 that come out and you see the young generation and I fear for my kids because this is really
 kind of the important point, is that as I look forward to their future and what they,
 sorry, let me pause this so there you go, millennials and Gen Z have a very poor view
 of capitalism and they have an increasing favorability towards socialism and hey, I
 get it.
 Right.
 You know, we've talked about the housing market and unaffordability and all those types of
 things and we've created a lot of those problems because of government interventions, because
 of what the Fed's been doing, et cetera.
 Corporatism is certainly a problem, but that's not capitalism, right?
 Capitalism and most importantly, it's the American dream.
 What is the American dream?
 I want to be able to go out and get that American dream and their view is, is that the American
 dream, this was a Wall Street Journal poll, sorry, this is a little bit small, but the
 Wall Street Journal, sorry, the Wall Street Journal poll, you know, 45% believe that the
 American dream is not even available to them anymore and that's nearly half the country.
 And again, it's not surprising when you take a look at the financial markets and you have
 90, 80% of the financial market is owned by the top 10% of income earners, right?
 That certainly doesn't sound like the American dream is working by any stretch of the imagination.
 The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, but those are also because
 of the decisions that we're making on the things that we do societal.
 You know, you want more bailouts, you want more support, you want more of this, you want
 free education, you want free healthcare, all sounds great, somebody's got to pay for
 it.
 And that just continues to widen that divide between the rich and the poor because, well,
 you know, that's the way economies work.
 And we've seen this over time is that, you know, this is the inflation adjusted household
 net worth.
 This includes your housing, right?
 You know, even for the middle class, that 50 to 90 percentile group, their net worth
 is yes, higher than it was in 2008, but not by much, right?
 Their wealth has not expanded dramatically like the top 10% of the top 1%.
 Their wealth has grown dramatically.
 So the reason I bring that up is that you can certainly understand why people are so
 deterred by what, and particularly when, what they see going on in the world today with,
 you know, the, you know, we, we started, and this isn't new, by the way, we started in
 2008 with, you know, the 99%, right?
 We had the people picketing on the lawn of Washington, DC, you know, protesting against
 the top 1%.
 And, you know, that, that was the start of all this.
 And of course, we've had arguments about when you $15 an hour minimum wage, you should be
 able to have a living standard based on $15 an hour.
 We've, we've gone through all of these things and they're all very flawed premises, but
 they're all a structure or a function of the oppression that people feel financially because
 of what we've done economically to our system, the debts, the deficits, the corporatism,
 the stock buybacks, you know, the making executives uber wealthy.
 And it certainly seems like the American dream is well out of touch of everybody.
 But, you know, then you look at somebody like Adam, right, that just left his job, starts
 a brand new company, and he's building a new company.
 And this is, that's the American dream, right?
 He's starting with nothing and he's building something into what he hopes will be a very
 successful business.
 And that's capitalism, right?
 And, and capitalism is what leads ultimately to the American dream.
 What is the American dream, right?
 We have to define that the American dream is not owning a house, right?
 That's the symbol of the achievement of the American dream.
 That is, Adam builds a business, he becomes successful, he creates a lot of revenue.
 He rents a house right now.
 So when he creates a lot of revenue from his business, he says, hey, I can now afford to
 go buy any house I want.
 That's the American dream.
 That's the American dream is not the house, right?
 That's just the assemble of the achievement of the American dream.
 So we need to focus on the things that we can do.
 And so I go through this article and I lay out 10 steps, right?
 And this is 10 steps that I try to teach my kids every day.
 And I send them videos and I send them articles of people I admire that have created a tremendous
 amount of wealth in this country.
 It's very possible, it's very sustainable, it's very doable, but you've got to be accountable
 for your current situation.
 I mean, so many people come to me as like, well, I'm in debt up to my eyeballs and there's
 just no way that I can ever do any of this because, you know, it's just my life sucks
 and OK, I get it, but be accountable for that.
 How did you get in this situation?
 Great.
 How are you going to get yourself out of it?
 Start there.
 Right.
 And this is in you and you have to believe that your life depends upon your success.
 And that's rule number two.
 Your life depends on it literally.
 Right.
 So I'm going to make this business work regardless of the cost.
 I'm going to sacrifice everything to be successful at this business.
 And you look at entrepreneurs that have become uber wealthy over time.
 That's what they did.
 They started with nothing and they committed their lives to making this thing work.
 Did they fail along the way?
 Absolutely.
 Did they quit?
 Never.
 And you have to be able to be willing to do that, commit to the job, commit to the business,
 commit to the structure, commit to the idea and do it no matter what.
 Control your circumstances around you.
 You have to really want it.
 And this is the problem with most people I see that start a business the first time they
 hit a road bump.
 It's like, well, it didn't work.
 So I quit.
 You know, you didn't really want it, right?
 You didn't really want it.
 If you quit at the first road bump, you've got to be bold.
 Nobody's going to take you seriously if you're not serious about yourself and you're not
 serious about your job.
 You know, you've got to find a guide.
 And Adam talks about finding a mentor all the time.
 Find people that have done it, find people that have been there.
 Go ask them questions.
 Be willing to work for them for free.
 Let me just tag along your coattails.
 I want to do this someday.
 And I have a friend of mine that I do that with.
 And I help him all the time.
 I'm always with him because I'm trying to learn his business because it's something
 I want to do in the future as well for myself.
 So find a guide, find a mentor, find somebody that's successful, that you respect and that
 you'll listen to and, you know, and decide whether you're a renter or an owner.
 Right.
 Renters can walk away without consequence.
 You know, this is in this and I'm not talking about homeownership here.
 I'm talking about business.
 You know, in business, you've got to decide if you're an owner or renter.
 Right.
 If you're an employee or renter, you can quit any day and walk off.
 If you're an owner, you don't have that choice if you're going to be successful.
 And again, this goes back to being committed.
 You know, if you've got no choice but to succeed, you'll succeed because you don't have any
 other choice.
 And you got to be willing to work.
 You've got to work eight days a week, 36 hours a day.
 If you're not willing to do that, don't even start.
 And then you probably need to get rid of all your friends.
 You know, there's a great saying.
 I tell my kids this every time they bring one of their friends home that they shouldn't
 be around.
 I'm like, look at him or her.
 Is that where you want to be in five years?
 And they're like, no.
 Then why are you hanging around them?
 Because the friends you have around you today, the people that you hang out with, it's where
 you're going to be in five years.
 If you don't hang out with successful people, you're not going to be successful in five
 years.
 They're going to drag you down.
 So look at your group of friends and change your group of friends, build new friends and
 build new relationships.
 And most importantly, get off social media.
 Ain't nothing good happening on social media.
 Turn off YouTube, turn off social media, get to work, because that's where, sorry, Adam,
 I know you're trying to make your business on YouTube, but for most people, you know,
 get off of these platforms because they're not helping you.
 They're not educating you.
 They're not feeding you.
 They're not helping you create.
 They're wasting your time.
 And if you're spending four or five hours a day on social media, that's four or five
 hours a day.
 You're not committing to building your business.
 So the American dream is not dead.
 You just got to go out there and get it.
 And you have to start today.
 So there you go.
 That's my rant for the day.
 Wow.
 Well, Lance, that's fantastic.
 I have so much to say about everything you said there, but I didn't want to interrupt.
 You did a phenomenal job.
 So first, let me applaud you for that.
 Wonderful.
 I'm going to send that to my kids as soon as I get off this.
 Thanks.
 If folks want to get that and read it or send it off to their kids, it's realinvestmentadvice.com.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 So it's the article from Friday, top of the post.
 Okay.
 Gosh, so much I'd love to say about that.
 We'll have to dig into it more deeply, maybe next week.
 I think the one thing I would add to your list there, which is be part of the solutions
 you want to see.
 So what you're talking about there is the individual taking control of their destiny
 in the current world in which we live in.
 It's just, hey, we have to deal with the world as it is, not as the world as we want.
 And capitalism, as you said, the type of capitalism we have right now really is corporatism or
 crony capitalism.
 We've talked about this a lot.
 You showed the massive divides in wealth gap, which is continuing to get worse.
 And to be honest, while it scares me as much as it does you, we are creating the siren
 song for these socialist leanings that the younger generation is migrating towards because
 they're losing hope.
 Like you said, half the people have basically given up in the American dream.
 So as individuals, we don't want to assign ourselves to that fate.
 And so we do have agency in the story and if we follow your tenants there, we're much
 more likely to have the type of future that we want.
 That being said, I feel like we should do what we can to help right the situation and
 try to contribute our own little piece to trying to make the ecosystem, the environment
 that we're in better for everybody.
 And so in the old days, so many things that are now in the purview of the government were
 handled by private charities.
 So if you can volunteer, if you can donate your money, your time to causes that you believe
 in that you think will help the system so that maybe government has a little bit less
 of an opening to step in, that's going to be helpful, even if it's just mentoring somebody
 else or helping the people in your neighborhood.
 But also, I know people roll their eyes when I say this, but voting, I mean, we've had
 centuries of Americans who have given up their lives to preserve our form of democracy and
 our ability to actually elect leaders.
 So play your role in pushing forth the reforms that you want to see in the system.
 And if enough people do that, maybe we'll see some change, but we certainly won't see
 change if we're not pushing for those types of changes ourselves.
 So I love everything you had there.
 I would just put in be part of the solution that you want to see in the mix.
 There's probably another 10 or 20 roles that you can add.
 Absolutely.
 Like I said, I mean, I'd love to actually just lean back and really kick a lot of those
 ideas around with you.
 I'll also say too, the thing that -- one thing that came to mind as you were sort of talking
 about the ills of the system is my wife is a marriage family therapist, as I think I
 mentioned a number of times.
 And she sees a lot of couples where the default is, "Ah, this relationship is getting tough,
 and I just want to cut the cord and there's somebody new who's bright and shiny out there,
 and leave the marriage for the affair or what looks fine and convenient at the time."
 Generally always is a worst decision.
 Not that there aren't relationships that you shouldn't get out of if they really are bad,
 but long story short, your long-term returns are definitely much better usually if you
 both work on preparing something that at its foundation is good or has the potential to
 be good.
 And I think that's the same thing in our economy, in our society here, which is we shouldn't
 reject capitalism.
 We should just be sitting down with it, with the therapist and saying, "Hey, capitalism,
 how can we get this relationship to be a more constructive one with us again?"
 Because it was so great back in the day.
 And I think the key point there is too, and you're absolutely right, is that we get so
 wound up in the headlines about Apple or Microsoft or Google or these corporate executives and
 we're so wrapped up in this, what the 1% is doing, that we lose sight of the fact that
 there's nothing stopping us from going out and building the next Amazon or the next Apple
 or the next Google.
 There's nothing stopping anybody.
 Just 10 years ago, there was no such thing as an electric vehicle, and this guy shows
 up and he builds an electric vehicle, and now he's the world's richest man.
 There's nothing precluding you from doing that, and I think that's the overriding message
 that I try to tell my kids is like, I know there's all these barriers that seem to be
 out there that are going to keep you from being successful.
 You're just going to have to climb over all of them and you're just going to have to force
 your way through and you can be successful, but you just got to be willing to do the time.
 Do the time and to persist through discomfort and to take on adversity head on, and this
 is actually my rant that we keep pushing, and maybe I just need to push that adversity
 and make a start with it next time around, but is I think so much of what is causing
 the loss of hope at the personal level in this country, depression, anxiety, all that
 stuff, is the fact that we have overprotected ourselves and I think in particularly our
 children from anxiety, which is actually the world's greatest teacher and it is the path.
 As you and I have talked about, the stoic philosophies in the past, the obstacle is
 the way. I'm happy to expand on this later on, but that was the mantra in my mind as
 I made my transition from my previous company to now launching Thoughtful Money was literally
 once I decided that a change needed to happen, what made it all possible was me just taking
 head on the obstacles that I had been trying desperately to find ways around or how to
 manage and to say, "You know what? That's not solving the issue. I actually need to
 just go straight through this thing."
 We raised our kids that way. A lot of parents were trying to shield their kids from adversity
 or whatever it was. We shoved our kids right into it, and it's paid off. They're all
 very strong. They're independent. I don't have to worry about them. They're good kids.
 They don't do drugs. They don't drink. They don't get in trouble because we never
 sheltered them from the bad things that are out there. We let them face it head on, and
 I think it paid off. A lot of people disagreed with us at the time, but I think the results
 speak for themselves.
 Yeah, yeah. My kids are famous in town for painting us as the strictest parents ever
 in Northern California, but I think we're glad we were. The thing I want to make really
 clear about this is I'm not coming at this from an angle of, "This is how you're
 going to make more money." Now, I think you will because I think it's a byproduct
 of the success you'll have by learning how to overcome adversity, but really, I think
 it's much more about meaning. I think it's much more about getting fulfillment out of
 your life, which I think is really increasingly lacking in the dangerously large part of society
 here.
 As I often say, if you are finding ways to identify your purpose in life and orchestrate
 your life around it, the money may come, the money may go. There's no guarantees around
 that stuff, but if you're waking up every morning and you are doing things with your
 hours on this earth that fulfill you and that you believe matter, then you've already won
 life. Actually, a lot of these other material benefits will likely come along hand in hand
 with that, but you're going to care less about them, to be honest. I was just listening to
 an entrepreneur who said basically that the more I succeeded in my business, the more
 it actually became about making money, and it really just came about making the difference
 in the world that I wanted to make and the things I wanted to learn.
 If you set out to do this only for the money, you're going to fail. You set out to do something
 you love to do. There's an old saying, "If you do something you love, you'll never work
 a day in your life." That's the true statement. I love what I do. I love my business. I have
 no trouble working 18 hours a day in my business if I need to because I love doing it. I love
 the writing. I love the research. I love talking to people. I love all that, and I wouldn't
 trade a minute of it. The money's really very secondary. I would do it for free if I could
 afford to eat, but unfortunately, that doesn't work that way. The money will come if you're
 doing something that you're passionate about and you truly love, and you're doing it with
 honesty, and you're doing it with forthrightness, and you're doing it to help others. That's
 always been a core tenet of our business. It's always been about service first, helping
 others. We do a lot of work for people for absolutely free just to help them, and we're
 happy to do it because that's our way of giving back. None of us in our business at RA Advisors
 has the time to go and donate a bunch of charitable time to doing things around town, so the only
 thing we can do or one thing we can do easily is help people that need help, and we're always
 happy to do that, but it's just a function of that's our business. I think once you establish
 yourself that you're doing this because you want to do this and what makes you happy,
 the money just becomes a byproduct of that.
 Well, and it's that alignment of integrity and customer focus, Lance, which is why I
 have you as a partner for Thoughtful Money here. It just speaks very well to the whole
 reasons why, important reasons why I chose your firm and you specifically. Look, I got
 to get you out to get you to your holiday party there. One last point on this and then
 I'll wrap up. I can't remember if I mentioned this on this program or not, but when I was
 at business school, there was a class everybody fought to get into because the professor had
 these great guest speakers and he wouldn't announce them beforehand, and I walked in
 one day and was shocked because my grandfather was standing there. The weird part was is
 he had died two years before. It's like, what's my grandfather doing here? And then I realized,
 Oh my God, that's not my grandfather. That's Warren Buffett. And I didn't realize how much
 they looked alike, but it turns out once I met Buffett in person, he actually looks an
 awful lot like my grandfather, but it's Warren Buffett and totally out of the blue, hadn't
 been announced.
 And we got to sit with him for an hour and a half. And he said, look, I didn't bring
 any notes. I'm just here. Ask me any questions you want. And one of the things I took most
 from that was what you just echoed there. And I know the advice sounds kind of corny
 and yeah, billionaire saying this so easy for him to say, but he basically said, stop
 working for the resume. We were all young, aggressive people at the time. He said, don't
 do something because you think it's going to look good to somebody else. Just find what
 you want to do. Find the thing that you would do for free, and then just figure out how
 to get really good at it. And you follow that simple recipe and you're going to be happy
 in life and you're probably going to be wicked successful at it too. So, if you don't listen
 to Lance and I, maybe you'll listen to Warren Buffett there.
 And in terms of just how busy we are in the work it takes to do all this stuff, I just
 want to, I'm going to give a couple of quick updates about some of the progress that Thoughtful
 Money has made. But one of the things I'm not sure folks realize that go on is all the
 stuff that happens in the background in between filming these interviews. There's the starting
 up of the business with all that stuff. And I whined about that a few videos ago. So,
 I won't whine about that again here. But there's a lot of business set up stuff, obviously.
 There's all the mechanicals of the scheduling the guests and the editing and getting all
 that stuff out there. There's all the running of the business with nobody sees. But there's
 also like there's a securities licensing exam that I got to be taking to make all this stuff
 happen too. It's a really thick book. And I got to tell you, this is really, really
 boring. And it takes a lot of hours, which I don't really have. So, I'm just trying to
 steal it from wherever I can. Point is, to do something worthwhile takes work and it
 takes efforts. But you do it because the rewards are that much sweeter because to enjoy anything
 that's worthwhile, you have to put in the investment to be able to get it. So anyways,
 Lance and I are just basically saying, hopefully we're modeling for folks here that might be
 at a point in their lives where they're like, "You know what? I don't love my job right
 now. I'd really like to change my situation." And there's a lot of wrestling that goes before
 that. I certainly did it myself before I made this latest career transition. Hopefully we're
 giving some folks there the confidence and the inspiration to say, "You know what? Okay,
 the obstacle is the way. I am going to lean into this stuff. I'm going to get comfortable
 with adversity." And I guarantee folks, if you do that and you follow the steps that
 Lance laid out there, your odds for success are very, very good.
 Okay, and wrapping up here, just want to remind everybody about the Felix Zulauf interview
 that is tomorrow. And so after you've watched this video, again, if you're watching it 24
 hours after its launch, you can probably go watch the Felix one right now. I also want
 to put this little win up on the screen if I can do it for folks just so we can all cheer
 it together, which is that as of this recording, Thoughtful Money is as of yet less than 30
 days old, and yet we have already passed over a million views on YouTube. I want to say
 a huge thanks to everybody watching here who's helped make that possible. That chart I just
 put up is actually I think from a couple of days ago, so we're like a million two right
 now. So a phenomenal start to this new channel. And again, that is due entirely to the folks
 watching this, so thank you so much for your support here. If you are enjoying these weekly
 market recaps, really glad they're back. I can't wait to rush out the door and give Lance's
 top tenants there to your friends and family. Do us a favor, hit the like button, then click
 the red subscribe button below, as well as that little bell icon right next to it. While
 Thoughtful Money is still this new, its growth and subscriber count is really helpful in
 getting the attention of the YouTube algo, so to help us hit even higher heights, please
 do hit that subscribe button if you can. Last reminder, coming next week, we've got Felix,
 like I mentioned, but then we have Alf Pecatiello talking about bonds. We've got Rabobank's
 Michael Every coming onto the program. He'll be giving us sort of his global view of the
 economy because he's located out in Asia, so we'll get an ex-US view. We also have Cameron
 Dawson, who will be joining us for the first time and just want to let folks know I finally
 did manage to lock in Lance Simon-White from Bloomberg, so he'll be coming on the program.
 And then Stephanie Pomboy, who I get emailed about every single day by all the viewers
 here is indeed coming back on the program, locked in a date for her for early January.
 So for those of you who've been screaming for more Pomboy, you're going to get her soon.
 Quick reminder that I've returned to the practice of writing up my notes that summarize all
 the interviews that I do on this channel. So all the interviews that I've done so far,
 as well as everybody else who I just mentioned, if you go to AdamTaggart.substack.com, sign
 up for that sub stack, and then if you want to get the notes, you can upgrade to the premium
 there. Super cheap. It's only like eight bucks a month. You'll be able to get all my notes
 for everybody that I've interviewed on this program or will interview going forward. Lance,
 my friend, I'm going to let you have the last word here.
 If you want the article or our latest newsletter, go to the website, realinvestmentadvice.com.
 You ask questions, comments, emails, always happy to answer them all. I answer every email
 every day. So if you have any questions, always happy to answer it. Other than that, have
 a great weekend.
 All right, folks. Lance, have a great holiday party there. Everybody else, I'm sure we're
 entering that part of the season where you're going to holiday parties too. I hope you're
 looking at a great holiday season with your family. And I mentioned that interview with
 Danielle DiMartino Booth. If you haven't watched that one, I'll put up a link to it right here
 so you can watch it after this. Lance, thanks so much again for another great week, buddy.
 Everyone else, thanks so much for watching.
