Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. Markets seem pretty convinced
that 2024 is experiencing, in the words of US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, "a soft landing."
But what if everyone's wrong? And if they are wrong, which assets are cheap right now and what will
happen to the markets? Steen Jacobson, chief economist and chief investment officer of Saxo Bank,
has been pointedly asking these questions of late, and today we're going to hear what he thinks the
answers are. Steen, it's wonderful to see you again, my friend. Thanks for working late at your office in
Copenhagen to speak with us. It's an absolute pleasure, Adam. Always there for you and hopefully I can
give one or two insights from a European's perspective here. Oh my goodness, I'm sure you
can give a lot more than just one or two, and yes, so you are sitting there in Europe. We have
the majority of the audience that watches these videos is US-based, but we do have a lot of people
from elsewhere in the world. We've had a number of them recently saying, "Hey Adam, can you bring on
somebody who can give more of an outside of the US perspective?" So I do want to actually
talk with you about what you see there from your perch in Europe and specifically if there's
anything going on in Europe development-wise, trend-wise that you think is important for
investors to keep their eyes on. Real quick though, lots to get through here, limited amount of time.
Let's kick it off with a question. What's your current assessment of the global economy and
financial markets? Well, we are very much in what I call the juicing of the system
sort of trend right now and what I talk about here is of course is the election cycle in the US.
It's pretty clear to me that, let's call it in the words of Trump, let's call it the
establishment. No, he calls it something else, but let's call it establishment. The establishment is
clearly on a path which is that they want to secure that the incumbent voters around the
world, and don't forget it's not only the US who goes to the polls this year, it's roughly 50% of
the world's voters that have to be in the polls and giving their votes, I mean including ironically
Russia, but let's put that to one side, but India is another really important one. We have South
Africa, we have a number of Belgium, we have probably Europe in terms of UK before the end
of it and I think when you look at this system with a bit of a cynical operative model like I
do, I think they're all up to just making sure the numbers. I think we could, I don't want to,
but we can talk about the the labor market data which is just ironically and truthfully
we should get away from even reporting non-farm payrolls. They have a revision of 50%
month to month. On top of that, this month for instance we have 353 new jobs, but the reality
is that actually we actually lost jobs both in terms of the non-farm but also in terms of the
household survey, but because we normally have less job in January then it was actually a plus
and to be honest Adam, I come from a world where one plus one is two, so I have
some difficulties with this seasonality and the concept that I'm going to do my
investment based on these data and I think that's the functional part of the world that
we're in a world where data doesn't matter. The equity market is playing monopoly
and this monopoly game is really just geared towards news by news story that we see on a
daily basis. It is very much in terms of trading focused on zero day options and the ability of
over at earnings report to buy a call for the next day. If you're right, you make a lot
of money and you make a big move like you saw with Meta. In a rational world, Meta shouldn't
be 20% different in value one day before and after an actual announcement.
The majority of what went on there was that he's got some control over the employment
relatively speaking and sees some success in AI, but he's in the bracket of basically being
in telecom and in marketing and marketing I don't think is going to be a huge success going forward.
Oh my goodness, Steve. All right, so you gave me a lot to react to there. I actually didn't
realize that 50% of the world's voters are going to have to cast a ballot this year.
That's a big deal. From our perch here in the US, it seems like the rest of the world
is becoming, trying to get the right term, more nationalistic. We're seeing the desire for
globalism and holding hands with the rest of the world and humanity. That seems to be getting
sacrificed as more populists are saying, "Hey look, we got a lot of problems here at home.
We want to elect people that are going to take care of our problems first."
Are you seeing the same from where you are? Absolutely, and it's kind of ironic that the
playbook for all this is actually Putin's playbook. Putin's playbook says that you have to be a strong
man. You have to be a strong man to cater for the average voter, for the voter who is in doubt.
So what is the one common denominator from the US and across the globe and all the elections that
we saw in '23 and we will see in '24, and even going all the way back to Trump's first election
and the Brexit in the UK, the fact is that people are not really voting for a person they like.
They're voting for a person who they perceive to be one that can defend the so-called,
in citation mark, values of our society. In the case of the US, the American dream, the ability
of making your own money independent of the state, the broader lines of that. In Europe,
it is maintaining the social status, having a reasonable society inside this social democratic
version of society that we created in Europe and which is working well. So the point here is that
every single election of the 50% that goes will be driven by whoever has the strongest voice,
who raises his voice or hers voice the loudest. We saw it in Italy, we saw it in Argentina,
we saw it in Brazil, we saw it certainly in the Netherlands where we had a huge swing to the far
right. So the voices of the far right and to some extent the far left are strong because they are
single-issue voices. These single-issue voices make the translating of the message that these
politicians have very simple and they are all of them catering to the worst of human beings.
They're all going on the scary part of your psychology and the way you think about the world.
So I think it's super interesting to see that the model that Putin adopted in the early 2000s is
actually the model that's being adopted by every single politician in the world. Come out with
strong voice, be single issue in terms of what you're trying to do, but forget about vision,
forget about what it actually means for the economy and totally forget about what the rest
of the world thinks of you. All right, interesting. So I've spent a lot of time on this program of
late talking about the growing wealth divide here in the US and I know it's happening in a lot of
other countries as well, where the populace, particularly the middle class, the one that's
really sort of the engine of the economy, increasingly beginning to lose faith in the
promise, in the American dream if you live here in the US, and I've talked a lot about the corrosive
and pernicious implications of that. You're basically saying that that is making its way
into the voter booth and people are looking for the strong man who's promising that he's going
to try to attend to their needs around that, their pain around that. In Europe, you've had Brexit,
you've had rumors of all sorts of other exits in the European Union. Do you expect
to see more of that in the future? The schism of the larger cooperative elements that have been
being built over the past couple decades, European Union being just one good example of that,
and I guess where I'm going with this is does that then manifest itself in trade? I'm trying
to figure out how this will impact the economy down the road. First of all, the major impact
is that, rightly as you say, the real return on capital, the real return on social
investments are negative, because in nominal terms you look like you have a growth, you have
the government in the case of the US spending a huge amount of money, but they're doing it
increasingly in the public sector and what you're getting for one dollar spent in the public sector
is significantly less than one dollar output. So in other words, you're really just borrowing from
the future in terms of crowding out the private capital, you're crowding out everything. So that
will make for the socially sort of unequal person things even worse, because it's actually diluting
your ability to have social migration, it's diluting certainly your ability to get
education because of the cost of it, and the sort of getting to the goal of where you want
to be with your life and your vision is getting longer and harder. The other part is that, and then
we see that, and I'm not going to come in specifically about the Vogue movement, but the Vogue
movement to me is clearly predicated on the fact that the biggest inequality we have in the world
is between the youth and our generation, Adam. Our generation and the ones that came before that,
they benefited from buying a one-bedroom apartment, then moving to a two-bedroom,
buying a detached house, buying a summer house. So we sort of rode the ever-lower interest rate,
the ever-lower inflation, and we benefited in terms of how we created our wealth.
If you were 22 years old today and look with the wisdom of you and me, there's really only one way
to reach for the stars in terms of the assets that you can buy, and that is why crypto and similar
sort of investment vehicles becomes interesting, because they are the only sort of instruments that
offers the hope of getting on to what I call the climbing of the ladder socially. So these are
deep-rooted problems and all of them sort of goes back to the same fact that we live in a society
that until very recently had zero productivity. That zero productivity is predicating again
on the fact that we had very low interest rates and no accountability in terms of how we spend our
money. Productivity is put in a different way. Economics, if you reduce it to two variables
that really matters, is demographics. We know where the demographics component goes over time
and the other one is productivity. Due to the very high inflation that we talked about two and three
years ago, we actually got high marginal cost of capital. The higher the marginal capital goes in
terms of cost, the more productivity you need to facilitate actually getting access to that capital.
So we are in a period where people will see it as AI, but I see it as productivity now.
It's really gaining. The only way companies, the only way individuals can actually compete going
forward is if they can offer productivity. So Adam, we sit in political cycle and socioeconomic
cycle. We are in what I call the ninth inning of pretend and extend, pretending we have integrity
and a model and extending by buying time. And that's what 24 is about. And why is 24 about that?
24 is about it because we have elections. So you have all of these sort of sinus cycles
coinciding in 24. The establishment needs low interest rates, which will make the central banks
more prone to cut interest rate relatively to a normal business cycle and independently on the
growth as well. And you have that the politician needs to be seen as being acting, which means that
they're going to be fiscally spending. And then on the other side of this comes that we probably
said, and this is the positive news, we probably said in front of the most productive 25 years in
history. Why? Because the marginal cost of energy due to AI, due to the ability of science through
AI, big data, to control something like fusion energy, to make nuclear powers more available in
a smaller scale, similar to what we see in nuclear submarines. So the cost of energy, which is the
single biggest cost to society, is coming down massively, not because of the new sort of found
resources, but simply because the world needs a more productive world. To get a more productive
world, we need the cost of energy to go down. And that will force investment into this new area. So
I know it's a long answer, but it is very important to me to understand to make you make
everyone understand. These are cycles who are coinciding. So they all have the individual cycle,
socioeconomics, monetary policy, elections and everything else, but they all come together in
2024 on a kind of a low, but from that low, we were sort of almost like Phoenix, rise from the
ashes. Okay. I like that you ended there on a note of positivity. So we'll talk about that in a
second. Although of course, if it gets to ashes, the process of getting to ashes isn't going to be
very fun. All right. So many points to dig into here. Let me ask you this. So if I heard you
correctly, we have enjoyed a prolonged period of time where our productivity got lower and lower
and lower, but we didn't really have to pay the piper because the cost of capital was held so low,
in fact, probably artificially for a very long time by the central banks. COVID and the supply
chain breakages, and then the stimulus response to that, let the inflation genie out of the bottle.
And when you have low productivity slam into higher cost of capital, that's where you see
who's been swimming naked. And so we've got to get productivity up. And you talked about,
that's probably why AI is being so heavily invested in right now. But you said something
that I'm trying to square in my mind here, which is we have a need to get inflation back down
again. The central planners, everybody wants low inflation here to mitigate our low productivity.
It's hard to run our over-leveraged economies when cost of capital is this high.
So we've got this need for low inflation, but as you said, the politicians have stepped in
to "do something." And we've got this tremendous fiscal spending going on right now in the US. And
I also believe in a number of European countries as well. And I've asked recently on this channel,
given the fact that the fiscal spenders have really dialed the fiscal spending up to 11
now, they've really brought it up to maximum, and it's become business as usual. Can they
turn that dial back down? Is the political appetite there for a politician to stand up
and say, "Well, we know we've been giving you a lot of excess liquidity here and whatnot,
and now it's time for us to tighten our belts, and it's going to hurt a little bit, everybody,
but we want to do this for the greater good." I don't think there's a politician in America
that would be willing to do that, I'd say. So can those two things be squared?
Because you can't bring inflation down if you keep spending this much forever on the fiscal side.
No, that's what classic economics will tell you. But as I alluded to before,
what you need to understand is that that fiscal spent, the value in terms of output is negative
to a large extent, or at least for every dollar, it's only worth about 40 cents. So as you crowd it
out, as you ramp up the spend you have, you're actually getting, due to the size of it,
mathematically, you're getting less and less output for it. So if it's 40% today,
it will be 20% in one year's time. So in itself, that momentum is sort of short-circuited by the
fact that there are no real output to it. Government jobs is not going to, more RIS
revenue officers is not going to save the America's productivity. So that's the one thing.
The other thing is the markets. I think pretty clearly the market told us when we were trading
425, 430 in the early parts of summer last year, the market was telling you for the first time,
probably since World War II, that the US government cannot continue without a plan for
what's going to happen to the fiscal deficit. Does that mean, going to your question, that the
government is really unable to do that? Certainly not in an election year, but down the road the
market will discipline them because the alternative here is, as you say, is that we flip to the other
side of the low interest rate, high productivity, we flip to a world where basically you need 6-7%
to attract investors ultimately. So the bond market, in my opinion, above 4.5%, 5%,
will totally slow down the US economy. Imagine we go, which some people are calling for now,
a little bit of re-emerging of inflation and Fed staying high for longer. The only thing that will
happen is that that makes the totality of the incoming recession deeper. So there are
pros and cons in terms of how it works. There are opposite forces at work here, but the two driving
forces of why it will not be able to continue is simply the output per input dollar in terms of
fiscal deficit is coming down. So they can spend as much money as they want. It will have to be
the private sector that picks up. A great life example of that is the Chinese economy. I know it's
pretty unfair to the US compared to the US, but what the Chinese economy got is a huge amount of
a public sector. As they have disallowed the private sector to actually operate, you've seen
what happened to the stock market, you've seen what happened to growth, you've seen what happened
to inflation. That is sort of your worst-case scenario. Obviously, that's an American model
that most people think is vibrant and lively. I often get asked, "How can you defend
capitalism when things don't work?" We don't have capitalists. I mean, think about Japan, the third
largest economy in the world. They don't have discovery of money. Discovery of money is the
market setting the price of money. I mean, it's the Japanese government, the third largest economy in
the world. Basically, in the US right now, you have almost the same because you have the huge
amount of issuance that you address in your question and at the same time, you don't have enough
demand from the banking sector because you put only sort of demands on the banks in terms of
new capital. The boss of free is getting introduced. Money market funds has picked up the slack, but
they are now reversing it down. So, when we come into March, one of the two scenarios I have
is that in March, we're really going to test the limits because liquidity goes out of the
market and the fiscal impulse, everything being equal cannot be as big as it was last year. Last
year, we added huge 5.5% nominal growth from the fiscal deficit. This year, it's probably
going to be minus, not necessarily because the nominal amount spent is down, but simply
because when you do like-for-like comparison in real term, in terms of impulse, it becomes negative.
Okay. Boy, my challenge here is going to be
trying to get as many of these questions that I have here for you packed into the time that
we have and I'm probably not going to get to all of them, but you just provided a really good
segue into your recent piece here, a chronicle of years that you've written titled, "Given two
options, then take the third." So, you basically said, "Look, there's a lot of things that could
happen this year," but you focused on the two trajectories that you think have the highest
likelihood of happening, one of which you've titled the "Everyone is wrong" trajectory,
which basically I believe is, "Okay, what if everybody who says we're going to have a soft
landing or even no landing," which has now become the dominant narrative, "What if they're all wrong?"
The second one is titled, "It's all about the election, stupid," and I assume that the central
planners will throw everything plus the kitchen sink at keeping things supported up until the
November elections here in the US or whatever domestic election is happening in whatever
country. Can you just give us a brief description of each one of those trajectories, why you think
it's got some of the highest probability of happening, and then in each case you say, "Well,
okay, if this is what's going to happen, this is what's cheap right now, and this is what you think
is going to happen to the market." So, let's dive into those two things too. Yeah, so let's go with
one. I end the note saying I think it's about the election, stupid, that will drive at least Q1,
and as we said in the middle of Q1, what I said beginning of the year was that
in a market where equity is treated like it's monopoly money and where we don't really
take any account between the economy and the market itself, it's an animal to itself,
the stock market, and if you have the central planners, as you call them,
being very, very conducive to and they have a high propensity to cut interest rate. You can
even see it in the interview in 60 Minutes by Powell that he's not even closing the door on a
March cut because he's looking for any softness in the data to just go ahead and actually do the cut.
Why? Because they want to induce the system, they want to make sure that the liquidity is ambled,
they want to make sure that the inflation is on a downward trajectory, and they have a major issue.
The major issue they have is that real rates in the US is sitting between two and a half and three
percent positive. The US has not seen positive real rates in 10 years. So the cost of capital,
going back to sort of the real cost of capital, is massive. Most companies that need to raise
capital in bank loans needs to pay eight, nine percent. These are not the rates you see when you
look at the 10-year, this is not the rate you see in the SOFA contract. These are real money. That's
also why, as we sit here today, the stock market in terms of S&P and NASDAQ is up, but RASA 2000 is
down. RASA 2000 is having R square with 10-year notes yields of 95%. It's all about the interest
rate cost. Financial conditions are easy, everyone says. No, they're not. Financial conditions
is measured in terms of the S&P 500. S&P 500 is really, it used to be seven stocks, now it's really
four. So every measurement we have, Adam, on this is really sending the wrong signals relatively
to what is the underlying story. Go to any businessman and I'm sure you do, even in
California, go to these guys. They're having issues in terms of cost of wages, they have
in terms of energy cost, they have in terms of government intervention, certainly in the
state of California on green, all these things that they need to comply with. It's just a massive
uphill struggle for them and in that sense, that scenario needs to be met by what? Lower
interest rates. So if you have too high real rates and you know, and this is one of my, that's my
really only strong conviction, we are going to see less than 2% inflation in the U.S. by the
year end and if that is the case and Fed is sitting around not cutting interest rate, real rates
would go from two and a half to three to 325 and that will kill the economy. So you have in one
shape or form here, you have the fact that whatever happens, if Fed stays too long, they will kill the
economy even before the election. If Fed then have the excuse to go, they will go. What would that do
to the stock market? Everyone will give you the data, you know, it's an election year, it's always
good. If January is up, everything is up. All this stuff that really has nothing to do with science
but it's all, you know, you could just as well go on the race course to play with this kind
of data but that's what the market believes in. That's the number one. It's about
the elections. Can I ask you one question about that? So there's a lag effect to monetary
policy and many folks like myself have been saying, "Hey, we've got to be careful that there's
still the lag effect from all the rate hikes that we haven't fully felt yet." Even if the Fed
were to cut, say, in March, given the lag effect, we wouldn't really necessarily see the benefits of
those cuts by the election, would we? I mean, could the Fed actually raise rates in a way
that would cushion the economy before the election or is it running out of time to do so?
Excellent point and of course not, but the stock market will preempt the move and we were talking
about what it will mean for assets. So the initial reaction for the stock market would be for the
stock market to rally. I do think that after that comes the fact when we have this compounding after
high interest rates and we know it's happening because if we look at bank loans lending,
it's now zero. If bank lending loans go to minus five percent, which is very likely year over year,
it's increased to taking 250 billion dollars out of the system. So we are in a system where
liquidity is coming out at the same time as the financial conditions are too tight if you measure
it correctly. These two things combined means that it's probably very likely that we have two halves
this year. We have the first quarter which already looks to be excellent, then in March we see the
liquidity drain, then in June, July, August, the central planners is going to panic and then we're
going to see a huge amount of liquidity provision. We probably see a retirement or part environment
of the QT to sort of reduce the system to be operating. The other part is that, and this
is probably much easier to explain now, the other thing that everybody's wrong is, of course, I've
been in this business for over 30 years. I never had a definition of soft landing. So if you
can give me one what a soft landing looks like, I'll be very happy to get it. But what will
most likely happen from -- I just gave you my trader's view. Now my economist view comes here.
The compounding effect, the fact that the M2 is collapsing, the fact that lending is
collapsing, the fact that delinquencies is rising, the fact that the job market is actually
normalizing much faster than people think, it's not still very tight. It's actually getting to a point
where it's getting nervous. If you look at the war notices, if you look at the announcement just on
a daily basis of company laying out people, it's big and it's accelerating. But the
concept here is that if everyone, and everyone is spending their bottom dollar on the magic four now,
or the magic seven, and everybody has the same trade on, the point here is that the market
is not liquid enough. There is not enough bids. If we have two days of 5% down moves, then we're
going to accelerate to minus 30% without the central bank stepping in. And that's where they
will step in. So constantly this year, we're going to be between what the markets from
the gravitation of the economic laws will do and what the central planners will
try to avoid. That is the fight that you as an investor this year, Adam, needs to take.
And my take on that is really, "Okay, I'm just going to take 5% either in cash
or bonds and do the roles and probably some of the better
commercial CLO loans are effective." I think 24 is a waiting game because these two opposing
forces are so strong. The central planners versus the compounded impact of all the policy
we've done wrong over the course of the last four years. I mean, the worst being that we
overstimulated when we did the reopening. But in that effect, it doesn't really matter. We are still
in the aftermath of what COVID did to the world. It accelerated the problem. COVID actually,
in that respect, did us a favor because we got to this point faster than we would have been.
We have higher marginal cost of capital, it's good for productivity going forward,
but it also means that the system needs to be cleaned out a bit before we can move on.
All right, the system needs to be cleaned out a bit. So I basically, if I took notes correctly here,
you think that it's all about the election stupid scenario, central planners throwing in the kitchen
sink, making sure everything looks great. That's going to be the theme for the rest of Q1 here.
When we get into March, you think we get into some rocky periods, then maybe perhaps the everyone is
wrong playbook begins to kick in and then at some point when the Fed realizes that or the other
world central banks realize that, then they rush to the rescue and I don't know, I guess what do
we see? We see damage in the economy from what they're trying to do, but we see juiced asset
prices again too? Probably not because as you can see with the small banks, we've seen recently that
real estate is becoming an issue, not only in the New York bank that is again today is up 15%,
but you saw Deutsche Bank in terms of their US properties taking a huge loss. You saw the
Japanese banks taking a huge loss to the US properties. So as you rightly say, this is a fuse,
a very long fuse that's been ignited there, Adam, but it's slowly moving. But in the meantime,
everyone is having a party on the top deck, seeing nothing but clear sailing in terms of what
goes on because we're going to have a magic soft landing and Fed is going to be sitting by the
wayside and just be willing to get up and help the market. That's how the market thinks.
The overcalculus or the wrong assumption here could be, as you indicate for your question,
that it goes out of control. Fed doesn't normally cut interest rate because of the
economic data because we have not allowed a business cycle to work since the LTCM intervention
in 98. So it's normally in 9 out of 10 times at least in my counting. They've done it because
there was an liquidity event in the market. It could be the small banks again becoming an issue.
It could be that the treasury market doesn't have the ability to take the
offering that comes from treasury in terms of the deficit. There's a number of factors that can do
it. The point is that all roads here leads not to Rome but to the fact that there needs to be more
intervention and this is all framed by the fact that real rates is way, way too high and Fed
knows it. Fed knows that it's too high. Fed is not looking at non-fund payroll. They're looking at the
base book, the reporting from the local central banks in the in the Federal Reserve System.
More than 50% is reporting that they have negative growth rates. They have rising unemployment. They
have problems with the system. Fed is taking notice of this and don't forget sometimes you
need to look at the CV of these policy makers. Powell comes from credit. He comes from the
private equity side. He knows when things come to a standstill. That's when he gets the reporting.
The reason we saw the pivot in November from Powell was the reporting in the base
book and the fact that we were starting to get a standstill in commercial real estate. We're
starting to see the bank lending collapsing. That's the point they're looking for. Now they're
looking for an excuse to deviate and get away from what they perceive to be their biggest risk that
they are loosening too fast but I think the risk here is that they are overstaying their tightness
because relatively speaking we should have a gradual reduction of interest rate. We may need
a very aggressive loosening where we see two times 50 basis points to start it off.
Yeah, it may not be March. It may not even be May but if it comes in June I will almost guarantee
you it needs to be 50 in June and 50 in July. What you're describing there
would be very consistent with history. When we look at the past several recessions they have
followed a rate hike progression. Usually rates kind of stall out or hang out at a plateau for
a while and then the Fed realizes, "Oh gosh, we stayed too high for too long," and then the rate
cuts tend to happen on our water. Yeah, and classically nominal GDP peaks just before
the economy moves to recession. There's nothing unusual in this. As does the stock market too.
As does the stock market. There's nothing unusual. It's like everybody talks to me like I'm an idiot
and we've never been here before and I need to understand this is a new way of seeing
the market like the third way I talk about. There isn't a third way as I push back on in
the note as well. There's only two ways. You need to be productive. The most productive stocks
in the world makes the biggest amount of money. That's a fact and at the end of the day
that's where the world needs to go to. The saving grace in all this is probably AI and the
ability of handling big data not in the, in my opinion, idiotic chat GPT version but in the
ability to handle the inside scientific database that can actually improve it. We've seen it as I
alluded to before. We've seen infusion energy where you now can control the plasma in terms of
stability. On top of that, inside the last two months there's been research showing that now they
even know every single atom there's in these plasma. So the scale that we are, the time
to the end goal of getting fusion energy or other alternative energy sources are getting
close. I sit on a thing associated with Think Tank in the UK and the head of the
commission that runs alternative energy which essentially is nuclear and fusion told me they
have promised. This is not me saying this. This is the high commissioner, so to speak, for this
in the UK. They have told the British government they're going to put into the grid system by 2030
fusion energy. By 2035 they will be fully rolled out with security and safety and everything else.
And if you ask someone in the energy sector they will say, "Oh, you said the same
50 years ago, 30 years and 20 years ago." Yeah, but the difference is all of the gains that's been made
in science now is because of AI and big data handling. It's the data processing that is
escalating massively in science which makes biotech and AI science sort of the
driver of that productivity goal I'm looking for. That is massively important and interesting
and I also love that it's the part of the optimism in the story. And I'm just going to have to agree
with you, Steen, that let's have you back on to talk about that with the time that it deserves.
I'm looking at the time here. I know you got a hard break and so I want to make sure we get
clarity on some of these existing points before we let you go, but I do want to really acknowledge
that that is a massive opportunity and that is one of the things when people say, "Well, hey, should we
all just put our heads in the oven?" It's like, "No, there's good stuff coming." But if I can, let me
get back to sort of how you see this year playing out. So if the rest of this quarter is following
your, we'll call it pathway number one, it's all about the election, you say that, "Okay, well in that
case then leveraged equity is going to do great." Basically, it's more of what we're seeing
right now. It's the MAG-4, the MAG-7 continue to do really well. Credit spreads fall close to zero,
which I'm sure makes a guy like you just scratch his head and wonder to say, "Oh my gosh,
with all the risks you see, how could credit spreads be that flat?" But then as the wheels
start to come off perhaps, here's what you have. And I just would love for you to corroborate this.
You say that the stock market could be down as much as 50%. So you're not just looking for
a little wobble in the system here. You're looking for some pretty big losses. Energy and commodities
become dirt cheap. You see that gold could actually really vault here, maybe have finally
the year where it gets up to $3,000 an ounce. Soft commodities explode in price. The ECB and the Fed
end up cutting by more than 250 basis points. You just mentioned that, that they're just going to
have to get really aggressive here. And that inflation swaps hit a new low and then rally
to a new norm of about 350 to 400 basis points. I imagine there too, you'd see credit spreads blow
out in that scenario too, right? Yeah, absolutely. But I'm not calling, let me just be clear,
I'm not calling for 50%. I'm saying in the worst case, it could be 50%. The temptation would be
to use the 2000 analogy and go for 90% in NASDAQ. But my point here is that when we try to handicap
the future, we cannot try to figure out what will happen. What we need to handicap is what is the
reaction function to X input. If X input is that the market drops 25%, you will see a massive amount
of intervention, a massive. So getting to 50 is the real, real worst case because I don't think
anyone would allow it to happen in an election year. So you have this rubber band, Adam, at all
times where if it gets too far on the negative side, both the economy and all the stock market,
the rubber band will need to come back because that's what the policy maker wants. So when you
try to, and you can't, but when you're trying to sort of handicap the future, always think about
what is the policy response instead of what is the consensus. The consensus is that Fed will stand by
the side and be able and willing to help the market. Well, that's fine. But if the banking
system, for instance, is undermined by its inability and its lack of capital, then making
another bank facility lending program is not going to be enough. Then you actually need to do
issue rights and making sure that they are capitalized at a better rate. So all of this
is a decision tree, but getting to 50 is almost impossible in 24, in my opinion. I write it
because people need to understand this is not a risk-free trade to just go all in on
equities every single day. It has been since forever, but some of us actually were in
the market before '98 and was in the market in 2000. To me today, I remember
Yahoo. You probably remember, Adam. In 2000, Yahoo was the hottest stock in the world. I mean, it was
going to go to like a thousand dollars. Sadly, not when it was the hottest stock in the world, but yeah.
It was the hottest stock in the world and it went to one dollar. I mean, I'm not saying
I'm not going to find a specific stock to illustrate that within the present market.
I'm just telling you that the future is not destined. It's path dependent
and that decision tree needs to be handicapped relative to the policy response. In 24, the policy
response initially will be a very aggressive cutting of interest rate because they have the
validation through high real rates and a falling inflation. So when you have falling inflation doing
nothing about the tightness that you have, you're actually increasing the tightening in an
environment where you really want to be normalizing your tightening. That's going to be the excuse.
The most likely event that will accelerate the move to the downside would be a banking crisis.
Illiquidity after March when the bank lending program runs out. When you see bank lending net
net because the bars are freeze reduced to year over year drawdowns of five to six percent and
all of a sudden you're going to lose QT is going to be half probably but they're still
going to be doing 50 to 80 billion a month taking money out of the market unless they
stop it fully. Number two is going to be cutting QT altogether and then we are back to where we
used to be. We're going to have inflation below two percent, not sustainable, but we will have
inflation below two percent giving them additional room to cut interest rate further. So the
policy response here is going to be we have validated, we feel intellectually strong because
we got inflation down. Whether the Fed got it down and it was just supply change being
solved by the private sector is a different story but the case here is for me, think about
this as a rubber band and try to handicap the policy response and then you get a much better
matrix of the potential outcomes. The worst outcome I can see if I put my trader brain
on is minus 15-20% before the reaction and then what they do at the time and the
ability of that to solve the situation at hand will dictate whether we go to 30% before we reverse
but the market cannot be down this year. We cannot have a recession this year not only in the US but
also in the UK, in Belgium, in South Africa, all these places have a vested interest in keeping
status quo. Status quo is the worst for the future but status quo means that we are in the
we started the year in the top of the ninth inning and by the end of the year if I'm right
we're going to be at the bottom but this is not something to fear, it's just something to be
prepared for that there will be these forward and backward moves, two step forwards, three
steps back before we end the year but underneath this sits again this productivity gains
that as it's rolled out in terms of the investment cycle in 25 and 26 will come to the rescue
reducing the burden on inflation, reducing the interest rate level that we need in the marketplace
and reducing the burden of the fiscal deficit that will be ever higher in terms of
the nominal growth. We just need to make sure that the overall economy grows more than the debt
grows and that's where we have the problem right now. We are growing less than the debt. We need to
get above the growth in debt. And do you think we will because we've been growing debt more than GDP
since like since I was born? True, I mean one exception. I mean say what you want about Clinton
years. Yeah, you had a little bit of a positive spell there with Ruben and Clinton but yeah
it's been a bad story and if you look at the CBO forecast we are not going to have a single year
between now and 2040 where the deficit in the US is less than seven percent.
Which is crazy. I mean during the European debt crisis we were after Italy for having debt
to GDP of 120 whereas the US debt to GDP roughed it today, same level.
Well look, let me just get to the key questions here before I lose you. So
you are a capital manager, Steen. You have to navigate your client capital
through this turbulent year ahead that you see. How are you currently allocated? 50%.
I have this, as you know, I have 25, 25, 25, 25. I have 4 times 25. Normally my bench is
25 equity, 25 fixed income, 25 commodity related and 25 cash or private equity and
sort of alternatives. Right now I have a total of 50% in equities mostly in two to five years where
it's pretty difficult to lose money in my opinion and then I still have 25% in equity
but I've tilted it towards nuclear power, semiconductors. Hey, I'm sorry. Can you go back?
You're 50% what? In fixed income. Okay, I think you might have said equity which is
why I just wanted to make sure. Sorry about that. Fixed income. So I think
in a year where I'm going to be punched a lot in the stomach I'm just going to sit around
getting the carry. So I'm in short-term money market funds. I'm in
two-year papers across the globe. I have two-year Germany, two-year UK, two-year US. I have some 10
years. I have some Scandinavian mortgages because Denmark has zero inflation
and current account surplus of 11% to GDP. So they pay me 5% to do that in a hard currency.
So unlike some of the other alternative. So 50% in fixed income, 25%
still in equity but normally in equity I'm not pretending that I know what will happen but this
time around I've sort of increased my exposure to nuclear power, defense spending, semiconductors
and big cap stocks. So normally I just take the index or the MSCI world
but this time I'm actually going after this sort of specific themes inside equity and then I have
in commodities I have 25%. I have 15% in gold and 10% in one of the funds the DBA,
the Invesco commodity which have yield carry because although commodity is done very poorly
relatively speaking, you have a huge amount of carry in this because you have backwardation
because of supply demand being out of whack. If there is a little bit of net
growth coming back or a little bit of inertia in the market, it will do well. So the expected
return for a portfolio like that over periods of time is 6% to 7% with a sharp close to one
and just for the record having no view on the market which is essentially what I have 25-25-25
has beaten 80% of all active fund managers forever. So just keeping the 24-25 brackets
keeps you net the biggest loss a month seen is 8% over the course of the last 20 years.
Wow, staggering. I know you and I have talked about the impressive performance of that allocation
in the past. Well look, we only have a couple of minutes left here, Steen. First question,
for folks that have really enjoyed this conversation would like to follow you and
your work, where can they go? So Saxo has a research page which is free which is called
analysis.saxo. Feel free to follow it. They are much, much smarter people than me on that website
but I do write the contribution that you were just referring to. I write once in a while notes there.
So that's the way to go or feel free to contact me on LinkedIn, of course.
Alright, Steen, and when I edit this video I will put up the links to your website and your
LinkedIn there so folks know where to go. Alright, well just in wrapping up, folks, if you've enjoyed
this conversation with Steen, we'd like to see him come back on the program especially to discuss all

those replay videos to your heart's delight and just a reminder for folks, very challenging year
as Steen did a great job of elaborating here. If you're a regular person feeling overwhelmed
about how to navigate your capital safely through what may lie ahead, highly recommend that you work
under the guidance of a good professional financial advisor who takes into account
the macro issues that Steen and I talked about here and when you put that requirement onto the
field, the percentage of good financial advisors out there that do all that really does shrink.
If you've got one of them who's working well for you, great, stick with them, but if you don't,
consider scheduling a free consultation with one of the financial advisors that
Thoughtful Money endorses. To do that, just go to thoughtfulmoney.com. These conversations are free.
There's no commitment to work with these guys. They just want to help as many people as possible
positioned as prudently as possible in advance. Alright, and with that, Steen, last question.
You and I have been talking a lot about money and financially related topics here. What's one
non-money related investment that you would encourage people to consider adopting in their
lives? Empathy. Great. So, I'm getting old. I'm thinking a lot about life
and I'm often in business meeting or unfortunately once in a while I get dragged into a cocktail
event and I've noticed that very often the smartest person in the room is not the most
aggressive, is not the one that talks the loudest, but the one that shows the biggest empathy.
And in a world where everyone is trying to blame, where politically as we discussed, people want to
come with a strong voice, I think the smartest person in any room, in any family, is the one
that shows the biggest amount of empathy because that shows you that the person is able to rise
above himself, his self-interest and becoming part of something which is bigger and something which
is, in my opinion, pretty beautiful if you can achieve that. Well said. There's lots of research
that shows the people who are most successful in life are those that have very high, I think they
call it EQ instead of IQ, but their emotional intelligence and I think you really just put your
finger on it there. And Steen, I can say, I know you weren't fishing for the compliment, but you're
one of the most empathetic economists that I get the pleasure of talking to, so thank you.
Thank you, Adam. Thanks for having me. It was a total pleasure. Thanks so much,
Steen. You're welcome to come back on this channel anytime you like. I got a ton of questions we
didn't get to, especially the whole nuclear part, so we'd love to talk to you about that whenever
you have time. Thanks for giving us your all like you always do. Everybody else,
thanks so much for watching.
