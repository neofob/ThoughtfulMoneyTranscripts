Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm Thoughtful Money founder and
your host, Adam Taggart, welcoming
you back here at the end of another
week, featuring my Genoesean
friend, Portfolio Manager
Lance Roberts.
Hey, Lance, how are you doing?
Good today.
You're really
working the fissures here.
I am.
I've got that thing working
overtime.
So I picked the word Genoesean,
which is derived from the Roman
god Janus, who
was the two faced god,
the two sides to him.
Thanks.
I'm a two faced friend.
I appreciate that.
Yeah, yeah.
I didn't mean it so much for your
friendship in terms of your
friendship, but I want
to put up two contrasting
headlines here.
Yesterday, we heard from
Ray Dalio
and he said, quote, "The stock
market doesn't look very bubbly."
At the same time,
same day, we had Bank of America
put out a report that said the S&P
is egregiously expensive.
So
how do we square these two?
Is one of these closer to rights?
Could they both be right here?
We're in this market right
now where to some observers, it
looks clearly
irrational. Exuberance is back
and valuations are super
stretched, but some others
are saying, "Hey, it's Goldilocks time
and the water's fine. Jump on in."
Well, so you've got two different things
that are going on. So again,
what Ray Dalio is saying
is like, "Yeah, this market doesn't look bubbly."
That's a sentiment issue,
right? So that is
when you go back and look at 1999
and 2000, investors were paying
up massively for companies with no earnings
and no revenue.
Bank of America is talking about the fundamentals,
right? Valuations.
And yeah, you look across 20
different metrics of the S&P
500, they all are trading between
80 and 95
percent of their historical deciles.
So yeah, the market is
expensive. There's no arguing that we're
overpaying for the
earnings and revenue growth that we're getting.
That's correct.
On the sentiment side,
we're not yet at bubble levels
in terms of sentiment. Now we're
approaching that level. We're starting to
get to that level in terms of sentiment,
but there's still more
room for that to go. Again,
if you think about the dot-com bubble
in 1998, markets were just
starting to scream higher.
And we were talking about valuations
and those type of issues
in '98. And then '99
and 2000, the sentiment
just went bonkers at that point.
I tell the old story about
I walked into my... I had a brokerage
firm back then that I owned and I'd walk
in in the morning, I'd open up the computer
at, you know, 815, I'd load up
trades for SDLI and JDS
Uniphase and some
of those similar type companies back then
and market would open at 830.
I'd be up 100 points in every one of
those stocks. I'd close them out, go home for the rest
of the day because that's all you had to do.
We're not there just yet. We're seeing
some of that beginning to occur,
but we've
probably got more room to go before we get to
that bubblicious type sentiment,
so to speak. So
they are talking about the same thing, but on two different
aspects.
Okay, now I'm going to go to a
couple of headlines written by
some guy who I think is very smart.
One of which
is titled, "This is nuts. An
entire market is just chasing one
stock."
I know that guy. He's a
total idiot. I wouldn't listen to anything.
Okay, so we've kind of got
Dalia over here. We've got B of A
over here. Where does Lance Roberts
fit in there? Well,
the note of that
article was that back in
January of 2020,
if you go back,
if you can strip out everything post
2020 and just go look back at the
market in 2019
and January, February of 2020,
the market was just going
parabolic. We were talking
back then very much the same thing we're talking
about now. It was just kind of insanity
in the markets. Valuations didn't matter.
People were just piling into stocks.
And nobody
was expecting any type
of economic event.
It was a Goldilocks economy.
Economists were like, "Oh, growth is
going to be awesome this year. The markets are only
going to go higher from here." Predictions for
the S&P were up
8, 9, 10, 12 percent for the
year. And so we wrote an
article in January of 2020 saying, "Hey, this is
nuts." When your
portfolio management meeting starts and
ends with, "This is nuts," it's probably
time to take some money off the table.
And so if you
go back and look at that period,
it's very similar to where we are now, that
same type of attitude. This is a can't stop,
won't stop market.
This is a nonstop bull market.
The train's just getting on.
And at the same time,
analysts are now coming up
with all types of ways
to justify current valuations.
But if you take a look
at stocks in the S&P 1500,
we have numerous stocks
that are trading well above
10 times price to sales.
If you don't understand why 10 times
price to sales is important, I've got a
link to an article in that piece talking
about that and referencing what Scott
McNeely said back with Sun Micro in 2000.
But you've got
a company like Nvidia, just as
an example, Nvidia just announced earnings
400 billion, you know, 400 billion in
revenue growth. I mean, they're just blowing
the ball, the cover off the
ball right now in terms of earnings growth.
So, OK,
we can say that, yeah, the earnings
will catch up with the price of Nvidia.
This is assuming, of course, Nvidia stock keeps,
you know, stops keep going up every day,
which it discontinues to go higher.
You know, but if the stock
would stop going up, yeah, earnings would eventually
catch up with the price and
you could justify the valuation.
But that's not what's occurring.
The stock trades at 32 times price
to sales.
So whatever Scott McNeely said,
you know, back in 2000, about 10
times price to sales.
And I'll just you know, I'll save you the reading
if you're if you're lazy.
But, you know,
what he said back then was is that at 10
times price to sales in a nutshell,
I can't pay taxes.
I can't pay employees.
I can't pay operating expenses.
I can't invest any money into R&D.
Most of that is illegal.
The other parts of it.
I can't pay any dividends.
I can't do any return to shareholders.
So which is not going to make my shareholders
happy. In other words, every dollar
of the company makes it 10 times price to
sales has to go back to the shareholder.
And it's just not possible and it's not reasonable.
Of course, that was the peak of the market back then,
too. So you're talking about
three times that
for Nvidia.
But again, you know, it's hard
to ignore the rapid growth
rate that is occurring with Nvidia.
Now, juxtapose that
with the second most expensive stock
in the S&P 500 or the S&P
fifteen hundred trading just
behind Nvidia
Wingstop, which
makes chicken wings.
Now, you need to tell me
that Wingstop
can grow earnings and revenue
as fast as
Nvidia.
And so that's the point
that we are at in this market
where we are assigning
growth expectations to companies
that are absolutely unrealistic.
And as as investors,
this is where we need to start paying
a bit attention to where markets
are, where markets are trading.
Fundamentals don't matter in the short
term. Right. So over the next 12
months, this market will probably
be higher than where it is right now
because fundamentals don't matter
in a 12 month period.
Fundamentals matter over a five
or a 10 year period.
And what fundamentals are starting
to tell us is that the risk
to the markets over the next three
to five years is
is growing inherently.
In other words, we're suggesting that
at some point we're going to have a
much more severe contraction
to realign
what consumers
are paying for stocks
versus what they're actually worth
relative to economic growth, because
without economic, the economic
growth is where earnings and revenue
come from, and that those two are
just grossly misaligned right now.
Okay, they're grossly
misaligned. We have
a lot of companies trading over 10
times sales or whatnot.
Hearing that,
it's hard again to look at
Dalia and be like, "Really? Not very
bubbly? Because that feels very bubbly.
Could it go higher?" Yeah, absolutely.
We live through the dot com era.
We watch the meme stock craze.
We know that when the herd starts
going bananas, the price can
go anywhere in the short term, right?
Right. Just be careful with Dalio.
Dalio says some crazy shit every now
and then. He said
cash is trash in '21.
In '22,
cash was the best place to be
in 2022. He says
this stuff. It gets headlines. People
pay attention to him because
he's a very smart guy, don't get me wrong.
He runs a massive hedge fund.
But him, Bill Gross,
a lot of these other people that make headlines,
they just say stuff kind of out their ass
just to get headlines and to say stuff.
But in reality,
a lot of that stuff never comes
true. The market does other stuff.
Bill Gross was saying that
interest rate, back in 2013,
interest rates were going to go to the moon and they went
to zero.
These all
sound great and stuff like
that, but you focus on the fundamentals.
Ignore what these people say because
more often than not, they're wrong.
Even Jeff Gunlach
was talking about interest rates
going astronomically higher in 2013
and he was dead wrong, too. So even
Jeff Gunlach is wrong from time to time.
Everybody's wrong from time to time
and that's why it's always important to pay
attention to what's actually happening in the market
versus what people are running their mouth
about. So totally agree
and nobody has a crystal ball.
Nobody gets it right all the time.
I just wanted to suss out.
Aggies always get it right.
Spoken like a true Texan.
But I just
wanted to suss out where you are
and it sounds like you are
more of like, "Yeah, there are real reasons to be
concerned."
Again, the judgment day
may be further off than we can imagine
still.
Let me be clear about the article.
Right now in our portfolios, we are starting
to do a little bit of
risk management.
Starting to interrupt, you're doing
more risk management because you always
have risk management somewhere in the portfolio.
Well, correct.
We're being proactive
now about taking risks. Last week, we talked
about trimming off AMD and Nvidia
prior to their earnings
and that's fine and those stocks
have continued to go up, but we're not selling
the whole position. But we're starting
to do little nips and
tucks here and there in the portfolio
just because we understand that risk
is becoming a little bit more egregious. Markets
are very overbought. We're very extended.
This rally that we had that started in
November is
extremely long in the tooth. We're up
15 out of 17 weeks. That's the longest
stretch since 1989.
That doesn't
mean the markets are going to crash,
but there's a
real possibility that
sometime between now and the election, we're going to have
a 5-10% correction. So whatever
the market gives you between today
and the election, the market's probably
going to give it up at some point. And then
after the election, we'll probably get a rally in the year
and we'll probably finish up the year in positive
territory. And that's one of those, by the way,
that's one of those really key points you've
got to pay attention to when you listen
to a lot of these narratives in the media.
They'll go, "Well,
every presidential election year is positive."
That's a
true statement. And the majority
of the time, and
going back to 1944
during presidential election years, the
win rate in
presidential election years, and I'm doing an
article on this for this coming
Tuesday, yeah, this coming Tuesday, I'm
doing an article on presidential election years.
But
going back to 1944
and actually going back to 1833,
the win rate for
presidential election years is 76%.
So 24%
of the time, you lost some money.
2008 was one of those
years where you lost money. But the majority
of the time, presidential election years are
positive. So you go, "Oh, well, great, I throw my money
in the market today,
and I'm going to make money by the end of the year."
It doesn't matter what happens between now and then because
Lance said that the markets are always positive.
You've got to be careful with that.
That's positive from
the first day of the year.
So in other words, we're up
6-7% for the
year so far. We could have a
correction in the summer, which is
very normal, by the way. And again,
part of this analysis I'm doing for Tuesday,
and we can go through some of these charts next week.
But during
September and October, the
market typically declines in
every presidential election year, even
excluding the 2008 financial
crisis. And normally, that's
because Wall
Street doesn't want to be long a whole bunch of
equity, depending on what's, you know,
they don't know who's going to get elected, right? So
if the incumbent
wins, I kind of know what I'm going to get.
And I'm talking about every presidential
election year, not just this one.
But if the incumbent wins, I kind of know
what I'm going to get. I already had
four years of his policies. I already know how
he behaves in office. I know all that.
I know what his agenda
is. So no big shock.
What I worry about is the
guy that gets elected because whoever
that is comes in, maybe
he's a big advocate for
increasing taxes or
cutting foreign investment or
reducing the debt, you know, something
crazy like that, like, you know, reducing the debt.
That might not be
good for economic growth
or for the market. So
I typically, as the markets, they tend to
sell off prior to the election.
Once the election is done, you kind of know who you get.
Then markets rally because then they go,
OK, this guy got elected
or the incumbent got elected, whatever it is, and he's
big pro and, you know, kind
of pro infrastructure guy. So they all go
pile into infrastructure stocks.
So, you know, that's why
we typically have this correction. So look, you're up seven
percent this year. This summer, you get a correction
that knocks off 10 percent
of the market. Now you're negative,
right, for the year at
that point. And then the market rallies
and by the end of the year, you're up one percent for the
year. Now, you're still negative
because you bought in today. The market sold
off. And yeah, the market rallied in the year end
and the market is positive. It's up
one percent for the year. So
statistically, the win rate
remains, even though you're underwater.
So you've got to be very careful
about this analysis that gets thrown out.
There's like, oh, don't worry about presidential
election years. Markets always go up in
presidential election years. It's a true
fact, but you can be up one tenth of one percent
at the end of the year and it still
be a true fact, even though you're deeply
underwater, which, by the way, is
today's article that small
cap retail investors are still under
water even since 2022,
despite this massive rally in the market.
All right. Well, you just provided the segue
to what I was going to ask you next.
So there's another article out by that guy
who I'm thinking actually is maybe pretty smart.
I wouldn't
list anything he says.
But that one's titled
Dumb Money is Back to Even
Making the Same Mistakes.
So what's the key lesson from that
here? Well, same thing is that
in 2021, retail
investors -- and so we go through a lot
of charts in that -- about
dumb money versus smart money. So dumb
money is retail.
Institutional money is considered smart
money. And this kind of goes back throughout
history. And the one thing you've
got to remember is that
institutions -- so you listen to Ray Dalio,
you listen to Bill Gross, you listen
to Jeff Gunlach, you listen to Wall
Street experts, you listen to all these people,
right? Even CNBC,
mainstream media.
They're all telling you it's a bull market,
things can only go up from here.
It's all good. Don't worry about anything
else. It's all fine. You've got to remember that
these people have one job
and that job is to sell you
something. Wall Street is
a sales organization.
That's all Wall Street is. They create
product and they sell it.
They're not out looking for your best interest.
They're not out looking for your
protection.
They're not going to tell you to sell and go to
-- they'll never tell you to sell and go to cash
because some event is occurring,
right? Even when the markets are declining,
you're down 30, 40, 50 percent, they'll tell
you to buy all the way down because they're selling
your product.
And so in 2021,
2020, Wall Street was
just providing all kinds of product.
We were doing SPACs, IPOs,
you name it because there was this huge demand
for all of these stuff.
And so we were we were investing in SPACs,
which were blank check companies.
These were companies you gave money to that had
nothing to invest in.
You gave them money, then they went to try to find
something to invest in.
Then those worked out terribly.
Right. And we did IPOs.
Those IPOs lost -- a lot of them lost 90
percent of their value during 2022.
So retail investors
were all happy -- Bitcoin, right?
They were all happy to buy crypto
hand over fist.
They were buying IPOs and SPACs hand over fist
and lost most
of it in 2022.
The drawdown for the average retail
investor was nearly between 35
and 40 percent in 2022
versus 19 percent
for the market overall.
And that's because, as is always
the case, retail investors buy the most
at the top.
They sell the least at the bottom.
And, you know, they wind up having
these massive drawdown.
So after two years of
the recovery, we've had this massive recovery
in the market.
Retail investors are still
about six percent underwater, but they're
almost back to even because
they're now piling back into the same
the same characters we saw previously
piling back into crypto, piling, piling
back into small cap, you know,
speculative stocks that are
making huge gains.
And, you know, like, you know, SCMI,
which is this small cap
microcomputer company stock
is up like three thousand
thousand percent or whatever.
But they're chasing that.
You see these same kind of meme
type stocks just roaring
off to the moon.
So it's that same type of mentality,
once again, kind of permeating the
market that will sustain
the bull market for a while longer.
But those will also be the individuals
that get crushed when you have the
next correction whenever it occurs.
And again, that may not be this year.
It might be next year.
It might be the year after.
Again, these speculative kind of moves
in the market can last a lot
longer than you expect.
But that's why we want to manage risk
and be careful we're putting capital
to work.
Okay.
And not to, you know, take potshots
at our friend, Mr. Dalio here, but
that is the role of a speculative
bubble, right, which is to suck in
everybody.
And at the end, it suckers in
all the dilettantes, the dumb money.
Right.
And those are the people who generally
experienced the biggest losses and at
the same time are the ones who usually
can afford those losses least.
Right.
Right.
And I'm writing I've got an article
that I've been pending for a while
and I'm probably getting closer and
closer to publishing it.
But, you know, it's very interesting
when you look back and you look at
the average retail investor and
or just I always say forget retail
investors, the average person.
Right. And you and I talk about these
stats all the time.
You know, less than five hundred
dollars in the bank.
You know, very little money, you know,
less than one year's income and 401K
plans, et cetera.
And you think about that and then
you come you juxtapose that to.
Financial commentary.
And I saw a really great piece of
financial commentary from this guy on
TikTok the other day.
He's called the millennial economist
or something like this.
Can't remember his name.
Anyway, he wrote an article.
He says, I've got a cure for Social
Security.
And I was like, oh, this will be
interesting.
The government just gives everybody
seven thousand dollars the day they're
born. You give everybody seven
thousand dollars.
And the government just provides
an account.
And that money is all invested into
the S&P.
And then, of course, over your
lifetime, as you get to sixty five,
that's seven thousand dollars will
magically grow to like three million
dollars a person.
So you'll have three million dollars
in your bank account over your
sixty five year period.
And then, you know, the government
then gets to tax that.
So they get they make a million
dollars on their seven thousand
dollars a year.
So everybody's happy.
And you've got all the money you
need for retirement.
Well, it's just it's grossly
inaccurate because markets
don't compound at eight, nine, ten
percent a year.
They average that rate of return, but
they don't compound at that rate of
return.
Twenty, twenty two will tell you that
that doesn't happen.
A twenty two percent decline wipes
out years of compounding.
So, you know, so the math
is functionally wrong.
But this is the information that we
give to people all the time.
It's like, oh, just just be
and hold an index and you'll be fine
over 30 years. Well, the other
problem with that is, is the
inflation adjusted value of that
three million dollars.
Again, if I had three million
dollars back in 1980.
You know, and when interest rates
were at 12 percent, I could live
a very nice lifestyle on that
interest income.
Flash forward today, three million
dollars at four percent,
given today's living standards,
is not giving me the money I need to
retire on. Right.
I mean, you're you're just not even
close to where you need to be.
And so.
So these mathematical computations
are always very wrong.
But importantly to all of
this, and this is the article that
I'm going to write, is that we've
had three massive bull markets.
You had 1980 to 2000
and people. This is where people are
living. Right.
I was born in 1965.
So, you know,
I lived through the 80 to 2000
massive bubble in the market.
Fifteen percent a year.
Average annualized rates of return.
Awesome.
Then I had the bull market from
2004 to 2008.
And then I've had the biggest bull
market on record so far, which is up
over 400 percent
so far from 2009 to present
on the back of forty three trillion
dollars worth of interventions.
Despite all that, despite these
three massive bull markets
and supposedly if I just had
my money in my 401K plan,
I would have millions of dollars
based on that, based
on this idea that markets just
magically compound over time.
But that's not true.
We can go look at the fundamental
statistics.
Twenty five percent of Americans
have money in 401K plans.
The average household has no assets.
The bottom 50 percent
of Americans have very
little net worth overall outside
of their house.
The next 40 percent up to
90, they own very little of the
equity market, as you've even
pointed out before.
Adam, you know, 93
percent or 90 percent, whatever the
number is today, is owned by
10 percent of income earners.
And they don't have the wealth
that suggests that these
three massive bull markets have
been a nerd to the value of what
we're that is promoted through
the media.
And that's because everybody misses
those periods of time where capital
destruction wipes out years
of capital appreciation.
True.
And, of course, the role of
inflation, too.
You have said a lot that don't
don't look at the stock market
to be your primary track to
wealth growth.
You know, even though if you get
started early and do a lot of these
things, you can give yourself a good
advantage. I don't want to diminish
the wisdom of, hey, if you can get
money parked in when you're born
to be in the S&P, great.
Take it. Right.
But really, you know, the
chief goal of
financial asset investor is to just
outpace it, keep up with or outpace
inflation.
Yeah, that's right.
All right. So let me bring up just
one more headline here, which is
and then then maybe while I'm talking,
you can pull up the just the
chart of the S&P and show folks where
we are right now on the technical side
of things.
But there is an article I just saw
the other day. The title of it was
investors are finding it increasingly
pointless to be bearish.
And to me, that seems like
sort of one of those headlines you
typically see at an extreme.
If it had said increasingly pointless
to be bullish, that's probably when you
and I would really be talking about,
hey, is this the right time to start
deploying capital into stocks because
sentiment is so low.
But extremes tend to be marked by
capitulation, which is a sentiment
index. It's when one side just gives
up and says, in this case, stocks
look like they're never going to go
down again. So let me just jump on in.
How notable for you is this as a
milestone because you're not only
trading the markets and watching them
closely, but you're talking to regular
people every day.
Are we getting to a point where those
that have held on and have used
logic about, hey, I'm concerned about
valuations or whatnot, but they're
just getting beaten down by their
neighbor who keeps bragging about his
video games and are just jumping in.
Is this sort of a late stage cycle
indicator?
Absolutely. That's what I was talking
about earlier. When you take a look at
sentiment, technical scores, et cetera,
they're just grossly extended. Our
weekly technical gauge, which is a
composite of 13 different technical
indicators, is at the 95 percentile
range. It goes zero to 100.
So you're at 95 percent as of last
week. I haven't measured it since
Friday, but because it's weekly.
So I'll measure it after the close of
the business on Friday.
But that's in the 95 percentile range.
You take a look at sentiment, which is
based on our fear of greed.
So the CNN fear of greed gauge uses
some proxy for sentiments in the
markets like high yield spreads and
even includes the S&P index as a
measure of sentiment.
So I find it a little bit flawed
because it uses the S&P to measure
the S&P.
Right. And so that's you know, that
kind of negates that a little bit.
So our fear of greed gauge looks at
how our investors position, because
that's really the measure of fear
or greed. You know, how much equity
exposure do they have?
How much do professionals have
exposed to the market?
So our fear of greed indicator also,
by the way, theirs is an
extreme greed gauge.
That's what I was going to say, even if
you think it's flawed, they're still an
extreme greed.
And like I said, you know, I just don't
like it as much as mine.
And again, I'm biased because I created
my mind.
You know, like I said, you know, the
flaw I find in their gauges that uses
the S&P to measure the S&P.
Right. And so but it has some other
very good indicators as volatility.
It measures spreads on credit, which are
all very good gauges.
If you take a look at the spread between
single B rated bonds and treasuries,
people are not being paid for the risks
that they're taking by buying junk bonds.
So that's a very good sentiment measure
that CNN uses.
And so, you know, there's some there's
real credibility to their gauge.
Don't I'm not knocking them.
I just like mine because it says, well,
I don't care about how you feel about the
markets because look, I can, you know,
tell you just from the people that
email me from listening to your show,
they feel one way about the markets.
They're positioned differently.
Right. I'm terrified of what's going on
in the markets, but I want to be as long
as possible because markets are up.
Right. So what's more important?
How do I feel or what am I doing?
And so that's that's our our gauge,
which looks at how people are positioning
themselves, the options market,
the equity market, you know, how much
equity exposure they have versus cash
and bonds, that type of issue.
And that also is at a extreme level of greed.
So we are just sentiment wise,
we are just getting very,
very long and we're getting very
comfortable with what's going on.
And there's a couple of interesting
things are going on.
Let me let me share this a couple of
charts with you here real quick.
With respect to this is something that
Mike and I are watching very closely.
So first of all, this is the this is
our chart of the S&P and two things
are going to markets continuing to kind
of grind higher here.
But we're in a very narrow range
ever since November.
So we trade to the top of this trading
range, kind of these two blue
lines in the middle.
We just kind of trade to the top of
that range and then we come down to the
bottom of the range, which also happens
to be the 20 day moving average.
So if you really want just a single
indicator that tells you,
OK, now something's happened,
it's time to get out of the market.
Just watch the 20 day.
If the market takes out the 20 day
moving average, now it's time to start
really paying attention to what's going on.
The other but at the same time,
the markets are grinding higher
momentum, which is the bottom chart
that's relative strength is declining.
So you have a negative divergence
between momentum in the market and
what the market's actually doing.
That tells that's that's a good
indicator that there's
some risk approaching.
We want to pay attention to the same
thing is, is with our MACD indicator.
It just has been grinding sideways,
but it is also negatively diverging.
So that growth in the
and the divergence between the moving
averages is starting to close,
but it's beginning to weaken at the
same time. So, again, nothing
that says anything
about anything at the moment,
but certainly worth paying attention
to these negative divergences.
One thing I'm talking about this
weekend's newsletter
as well is that we
have the one of the largest divergences
above the 200 day moving average.
That's this red this red arrow on the
right.
This is one of the largest divergences
we've had from the 200 day moving
average prior to any correction
and going back
through history.
And so when you start realizing
that moving averages are like gravity
in order to have a moving average
is prices have to trade above
and below that moving average.
Otherwise, the moving
average would be vastly different.
So the last not an average.
So in the last 200 days,
the market has traded both above and
below that 200 day moving average.
The current divergence cannot
exist indefinitely.
Otherwise, the 200 moving average
has to slope up very sharply to start
catching up with the price of the
market's going to keep rising higher.
And that's certainly possible near
term. But this divergence is
going to close at some point.
And we're and the
the width or the
the the deviation of
that is so great now
that gravitational pull is really
going to is really going to start to
weigh on market.
So tells you two things here.
One is that this negative divergence
of momentum. Also, we talk about
breadth of the market.
One thing is, is that when
we take a look at sentiment as
a whole, we're starting to see some
some real deterioration in cinema
as well. So our simple visor
sentiment index is at 100.
It's as high as it can get.
And so this
doesn't tend to last long.
When you take a look at the breadth of
the market, this is the number
of stocks above 150 to 75
in the 50 day moving averages.
You have again, the markets
are rising, but you have this negative
divergence in underlying breadth
of stocks participating
in that advance.
And so ultimately,
that's going to have to get reversed
at some point. In other words, either
all of a sudden stocks are going to rip
them back off to the moon again on a
broad basis or the market's
going to come down.
And normally when you have these divergences
of this type where you have the market
going up and stocks and
breadth going down, that was
basically the peak of the market in
July of last year before
we had that 10 percent correction.
It's the peak of the market that
you had back in the
early parts of 2022
before you had the correction.
You know, so normally when you had
these big divergences
between stocks, you know, stocks,
the number of stocks participating
versus the market, it generally
winds up at a correctional phase of the
market in the future.
Okay.
So generally ends up
in a correctional phase in the future.
You know, again, I just sort of keep
hearing from you, Lance, that you talk
a lot about the analogy of the rubber
band as it gets stretched and the further
it gets stretched, the more
the concern becomes that the snapback
is going to happen and be more
violent the more that the band gets
stretched. You're nodding as I'm saying
all this, so it sounds like
you're getting increasingly concerned about
the market environment.
You are beginning to take more off the
table or put in more risk management
strategies. You're not like,
it's not an everybody out of the pool
movement for you guys, but
you're beginning to become more and more
defensive here given what
you just walked us through.
Right.
Just from a, you know, just kind of
a, you know, a very basic
analogy. Right.
You're speeding down the freeway.
Right.
And I don't know if you've ever driven on
I-10 across Texas.
I have. It's like driving across
the moon.
It is. It's flat.
And you can literally see
20 miles ahead of you on the freeway
because the road is completely straight.
It's completely flat.
And you can go, oh, you can literally
see there is no traffic and no
cops and the foot goes down on the
accelerator and there you go off I-10.
Well, what you what ultimately
what happens is that your
exit, if I'm going to drive
from, you know, Texas to San
Antonio, I'm sorry, from Houston to San
Antonio, straight road.
But at some point, I'm not to exit
off the freeway, either to stop at
Buc-ee's, which is normal
or to Buc-ee's.
Yeah. Yeah.
So I mean, they're going to stop at
Buc-ee's or, you know, I'm going to
take you don't have to exit the freeway
to go where. So when I know
my exits approaching, what
do I do?
Right. I don't slam on the brakes
and go, you know, theoretically in
market terms, go to cash.
Right. I just ease off the accelerator.
I slow down. That's my first measure of
risk management.
Then as my exit
gets much more close and I can
see the evidence of my
my, you know, my
exit.
Right. My off ramp.
Right. I see the sign that says, you
know, half mile ahead.
Maybe I tap the brake a little bit
just to really start to slow down a
bit. I move over in the right hand
lane. I put my signal on that I'm
going to exit.
Those are all cautionary moves.
None of that is slam on the brakes
and stop the car on the side of the
road. I just know that I've got
an exit approaching.
And so I take some precautionary
measures as I begin to exit
the freeway.
I put my foot on the brake.
I slow down more until I come to
a stop.
You know, at the you know, whatever
happened, you know, where we got to
turn, you know, coming up next.
And that's the same thing to the
portfolio. So, you know,
right now the portfolio is fully
allocated to equities.
We're not reduced.
We're not removing positions.
We're just reducing some positions
that are.
I mean, look, since we bought AMD
and Nvidia, they're up 80 set
between 70 and 90 percent, both
of them. So, you know, it's just
ridiculous how much they've grown
in just the recent first
couple of months of the year. So
we're just kind of reducing those
positions back to target weight.
We're not taking them out of the
portfolio.
We're beginning to look at other
things like so in our in our models
where we run options
where, you know, buying, you know,
buying very small, a very small
number of puts and then
writing some out of the money calls
against those puts.
So we're doing some cashless option
collars in the portfolio just
as a hedge.
And so if the market declines,
then that
will help support
the underlying equity portion
of the portfolio. So there's things
that you can do without taking
on a lot of risk that gives
you some ability to navigate that
exit. And then at some point, if
something happens, I need to exit
much more quickly.
Then I can raise cash rapidly.
I can add on more puts.
I can do whatever I want.
I need to do. I can short the
market.
But there's no reason to start
heavily shorting the markets right
now because there's no evidence
that it's time
to exit from the freeway.
The freeway is still fine right now.
The market's still trending higher.
We're in that trend channel.
We haven't violated the 20 day
moving average. We haven't violated
the 50.
So there's nothing right now
that says short the market.
Shorting the market heavily right
now, betting on a decline
may not work here for a bit.
Got it.
Just to continue your analogy,
though.
Maybe you're
maybe you're just looking at the
dashboard and saying, I've been
driving far.
It's hot outside.
I'm a little bit worried that the
car's beginning to overheat.
And so I'm kind of looking to
see where the exits are ahead in
case I need to go off and cool
the car off for a bit.
No, I don't care about the car
overheating.
Right. All I want to know is,
look, right now, if if I
was if I were running 100% equity
portfolio, I have my foot to
the pedal and just be running.
Right. I don't care that it's red.
The car's redlining, whatever it is.
That's fine.
The market's not told me any reason
to stop pushing the car at this
point. Right.
From a technical standpoint.
Yes, technical standpoint.
I've got no indication.
I've got no flashing red lights.
I don't have the engine light
coming on.
I don't have smoke coming out of
nothing like that.
The car is just you know, we're
driving a Ferrari and it's
performing fantastic right now.
So that's why I'm saying the exit
is a much better example, because
that is something that I need
to reduce for.
That is apparent, right,
and right now we have no apparent
needs, the car's running fine, it's
humming right along.
It doesn't matter that I've been
pushing this this the car since
November.
See, that's the sentiment that gets
people into trouble.
They start worrying about things
that aren't valid reasons.
Right. So we're always looking out.
So in other words, this is people
look, you know, your analogy is, is
I'm looking at the world.
And so I'm going to hedge for
something in the future
that there's no evidence of just
yet.
I want actual evidence and we don't
have that.
Yeah, but just to make sure we're
not confusing listeners here, but
you're saying, hey, we are
we are doing some things to trim
and put some defensive, you know,
more risk management into the
position. And so I was trying to use
your analogy of like, OK, so maybe
you're easing off the gas a little
bit. Right. You're just saying in
case I need to let me just
know where the exit is.
OK, OK.
So so, yeah, use your example.
I was pushing the car to redline
earlier this year. So I go, I can't
really keep doing that.
So I backed it off to where I'm just
running next to redline.
OK, so that that's more my analogy
where I was thinking, OK, yeah, OK.
That I can agree with.
OK.
All right. So moving
on here because we're at my first
bullet, I guess my second
because Genoese and was my first
bullet.
Still get a bunch of.
Call me to face.
I still have gotten over that one.
So go ahead.
All right. So I don't know if you've
got your your
RIA net liquidity
chart handy to bring up.
If you don't, it's OK.
But I want to
bring up another headline, this one
by Michael Avery from Rabobank.
He just put out a piece titled
we're supposed to be in a restrictive
phase of monetary policy.
So what the hell is going on?
Right.
And in the article, he says the
following.
We are, after all, supposed to be in
a restrictive phase of monetary
policy. Globally, we are at levels
of nominal and real interest rates,
which we thought were unthinkable a
few years ago, in which many
prefer not to think about now.
Stay alive until 25 is still
the mantra in some places.
So in the article, he basically
talks about how, you know,
prices of everything are rising.
He rails about Nvidia just the way
that you did earlier.
And he's basically asking the
question, I think many viewers
are still scratching their head on.
And I've asked many times on this
channel, which is like, I mean,
Lance, I remember talking to you
when the Fed first started
the rate hike campaign and you were
like, they're not going to get above
three. Like the economy just can't
take that. Right. And they've gone
higher for longer, way higher for
way longer than anybody imagined.
And even still, we're at
all time highs in the markets right
now. Right.
And so
I guess the question that I have
here is we've talked a bit about
this, but bring up your liquidity
chart. I was
interviewing Gordon Long
the other day. His interview is
going to come out actually the day
after this one airs.
Great interview, folks.
Definitely watch it. If you've seen
Gordon, you know, he's a great
interview.
But he brings up a chart of
fiscal conditions and shows that
there's actually been no tightening
of fiscal conditions
since
even prior to the
Fed's rate hiking campaign.
So it's sort of like we're
we're I
don't want to say we're being duped,
but but this
impression that we all have that
conditions are a lot tighter
than they were a few years
ago, it actually hasn't manifested
in the financial conditions side
of the world. And obviously, that
sort of explains why we're at all
time highs here. By the way, folks,
too, I've got Michael Howell coming
on next week, who's the
liquidity expert. So we're going to
hear his side of the story, too.
So my question is, is like,
what do you see winning out here?
Is the liquidity just going to
keep rising and everything else be
damned? Or we'll
hire for longer if it continues
sort of as is so far, will that
eventually come to burn us?
Well, look, there
are some things that are going on
right now that certainly don't
make a lot of sense. And
for instance, if you take a look at
the financial conditions index,
it's at an all time high. And
now the last time that financial
conditions were at this level,
we were doing five
five trillion dollars in stimulus
checks to households.
The Fed was cutting rates to zero.
They were one hundred and twenty
billion a month in QE.
We were bailing out junk bonds.
We were bailing out institutions.
We bailed out Boeing.
We bailed out royal cruise lines.
And so, yeah, you have these massive
this massive surge of financial
conditions and
financial conditions are back
to that level. Now, I want to be
clear here because I got an
interesting email about this day
before yesterday.
You know, the question was is yields
on the tenured Treasury are four
percent.
You know, why?
Why is you know, why is financial
conditions so easy?
Well, it's not just yields.
Yields have come down.
They were five. They're down to four.
There's also the strength of the
dollar.
It's there's a whole bunch of
other the S&P index, others
that all make up that financial
conditions. So when you talk about
financial conditions, sentiment is
rising. You take a look at consumer
sentiment as a whole.
Consumer sentiment has been rising
strongly, but sentiment
about future
stock market prices.
In other words, what what do you
think the price of the market
will be 12 months from now?
The answer is higher.
That that sentiment
is now back to an all time high.
So consumers are
ultra confident about rising stock
prices. That's easier.
Financial conditions.
Why? Because if I'm convinced that
stock market is going up, I feel
better about things.
So I got to spend money in the
market. That's that's been Bernanke's
whole premise behind QE is to boost
sentiment, to boost economic growth.
Dollars getting stronger, not weaker.
You know, all those concerns about
the dollar collapsing.
That's gone.
And so you have all this other stuff
that's happening in the market that's
providing this fuel.
And again, this is the I
had to update the liquidity index
while you're talking. So this is my
actual spreadsheet.
So ignore some of the other stuff
that's hovering around.
But that's the index.
And yeah, it's ever since the
bottom of the market in October of
twenty twenty two, those
that liquidity has been increasing,
despite this idea of quantitative
tightening, despite the fact that,
you know, higher interest rates,
we're still supplying a lot of
liquidity to the markets.
And so markets keep rising.
And it's not just financial
liquidity. It's also, again, like I
said, stronger dollar that's
attracting massive foreign inflows
into into the US right now.
That's boosting assets.
Cinnamon is rising sharply.
That's boosting asset prices.
Nobody wants to be short the market
and they don't want to be out of
the market. So that's boosting
the market.
So that's why the market's behaving
the way it's behaving and why
financial conditions are so easy,
despite the Fed talking
about needing to tighten financial
conditions to
and to bring down inflation.
And so it's a real quandary.
The Fed's gotten themselves into
because everything that they've done
didn't work to bring down
the risk to higher inflationary
pressures. In fact, they've got
themselves backwards now.
OK, and I'm going to trundle into
inflation in just a second here.
So,
you know, your blue lines there show
really big divergences.
Yeah. Well, the reason for that is
is the last time we had this big
divergence, you had a 10 percent
correction in the market.
And so I was writing an article.
I think this was in last weekend's
newsletter, maybe before.
I can't remember where I use this
chart, but, you know, the point
of this is that the markets got way
ahead of the liquidity.
And this is back to that.
Why we'll probably have a five to
10 percent correction this year is
because you've got to reverse.
You'll notice that that by
the end of that 10 percent
correction, we were about equal with
where liquidity was.
So, again, that's you know, we just
got a very big divergence right
now. And so markets are probably
going to have to have a five to 10
percent correction to realign with
liquidity.
Okay.
So.
I'm just going to ask this question.
So is this what Bitcoin
is reacting to right now?
Absolutely.
It's all expected in further.
Okay.
So, I mean, I want to
I want to acknowledge and hand it to
the Bitcoiners who when Bitcoin was
under 20, you know, we're still
hanging around saying, you know,
this is
a good investment thesis here.
It has done very well this
year, whether you think it's the
right long term strategy or not.
And folks, I'm planning on bringing
on a Bitcoin expert just to
just to.
You know, educate the
audience here about.
It again, but also, you know,
update it for what's been going on in
the past six months, 12
months, whatever.
And if you're interested in that, let
me know in the comments section
below. But
you got to be really careful with
that statement, though, because this
whole explosion in Bitcoin
was around ETF issuance.
There's been forty six billion
dollars piled into ETFs.
They all have to buy Bitcoin.
Exactly.
I'm with you on that.
Yeah. Right. Right.
But the thesis for Bitcoin
was Bitcoin is going to replace
the currency, all that.
That is not what's going on with
Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not the
change in the fiat currency system.
That this is simply a function
of now very easily.
And again, I'm not I'm not pooh
pooh in the rise in Bitcoin.
Don't get me wrong. I'm long
Bitcoin. I'm long either
for the same reasons is that those
ETF issuances
create demand for the Bitcoin
that has nothing to do with any of
the fundamental principles around
Bitcoin.
And if you don't have an ETF
tied to one of the
other words right now, you buy
Bitcoin because it has an ETF
wrapped around it.
Ether does not.
But that's the next ETF to get
issued. So that's why that's going
up once you get outside of that to
some of these other sub one dollar
Bitcoin. I see a bunch of tick talks
about here's a five bitcoins I'm
buying because they're going to make
me ten million dollars over the
course of the next month.
You know, they have nothing to do
with ETF issuance and that
they don't have the buying
that ETFs are creating.
So, you know, the art Bitcoin ETF,
the Grayscale Bitcoin,
Spot Bitcoin ETF,
BlackRock, Fidelity.
Those are the that's what's driving
the buying of Bitcoin.
That's a very different environment
from the thesis
that was put out about Bitcoin.
It's also a function
that will be a problem for
Bitcoin over the course of the next
year or so, because now I can short
ETFs so I can create a
lot of shorting against Bitcoin
and Ether during a decline.
So in other words, when we get to the
next decline in Bitcoin,
that move down will be exacerbated
by the shorting of the ETFs that occurs
when that happens.
All right. So you're making exactly
the point why I'm saying I'm going to
bring somebody on here because I think
that there's a lot of newness about
what's going on and driving the price
action versus just the thesis
that many of us heard, you know,
years ago about it and
bring it up here because it's all
about capital inflows going
into those coins
and those are being highly driven both
by the new ETFs, as you said, but
also by liquidity, which is
getting pushed into those ETFs.
Right. And then this, of course,
and that conversation also brings up
here, let me just grab this chart real quick.
You know, the rise in Bitcoin
and again, this goes back to the
speculative kind of buying of
what's happening, you know, kind of in
the overall market, we're seeing this
goes back to the whole retail investor
thing and what's happening.
And is that, you know,
I'm just going to use a different chart
just real fast. It's not.
Being a little slow this morning,
but here's my first strategy,
which is a software company,
and this stock has gone from
five hundred dollars to thousand
dollars over the course since we
started issuing out Bitcoin ETFs.
And this company has nothing to do
with bitcoins other than they bought
bitcoins and put it on their balance
sheet. They use debt to do it.
But their business line
is software.
Right. And so people
are buying this stock
under the assumption that Bitcoin
is just going to go to the moon.
And, you know, it's all going to
buy the stock to get the return.
And so people are and this is a very
small cap company. So you get these
kind of get this meme stock
type movement.
And then it's been a great trade,
right, because of this.
I mean, you get a much bigger return
on investment chasing micro strategy
than you do buying the actual
underlying ETF.
Yeah, look at that. Sorry to interrupt.
But I'm assuming these are monthly
candles.
Yeah.
In the last month or I guess in
February, it looks like it went from
five hundred to over a thousand.
Yes.
Yes.
And that's but that's but that's the
speculative fervor right that we're
talking about in the market.
And again, these
can't these type of movements
can't last forever.
And this stock is now approaching
being as overbought
as it was back in twenty twenty one
before it lost 90 percent
of its value.
And that's my point.
You know, we always look and I'm not
let me be really clear.
I don't want you to get a bunch of
hate from Bitcoin people.
I'm long Bitcoin.
I think it's fine.
If you want to buy some buying ETF,
it's completely OK.
Make it a small portion of your
portfolio, whatever.
Just be aware of it.
My whole point is I'm just saying be
aware of the risk because
this asset class versus
the S&P can
lose 80, 90 percent
of its value very quickly.
And it's done it in the past.
And once you start to get the
spec again and with ETFs
now, it really exacerbates this
problem.
There's not huge trading volume
across Bitcoin.
There's there's there's a lot
of people that are just holding
Bitcoin and they're not planning
on selling it. So there's not a lot
of volume that moves price.
And that's why you get these very
big price movements
in Bitcoin very quickly.
And MicroStrategy, as an example,
is technically
not actually, but it acts like a
leveraged bet on
Bitcoin. So if Bitcoin declines
by 50 percent
over the course of the next couple
of years because of whatever event
occurs, this stocks
will lose 90 percent of its value.
And that's just that.
What happens when you unwind
that speculation in these very
low volume trading type companies,
there's just a lack of liquidity that
exists in the markets overall.
And that's why we have this very
these major
exacerbated moves.
There's a ton of risk here.
But again, I'm not poo-pooing
Bitcoin.
Just understand the environment
you're buying into and what the
underlying risk of that is.
All right. All right.
Well, well put.
And and again, folks, if you're
interested in that Bitcoin expert
coming on, let me know in the
comment section below.
All right. Moving on.
So we touched
a little bit on inflation.
So I just
did an interview earlier
this week with Oliver Rust, who's
one of the co-founders of
Truflation.
Right. So very interesting
conversation.
Truflation, basically, they
their goal is to try to come up with
a measurement of inflation
that they feel is more representative
of what the average household
experiences.
And so it's really interesting
because it's it actually is a
blockchain based
platform and it tracks
over like, like I said, over 14
million individual data inputs
in real time.
So unlike the BLS
calculations that that
have a lot of assumptions in them
and a lot of, you know,
adjustments that can be,
you know,
kind of squishy, you know,
hedonics, substitution, that type
of stuff.
This is just like a brute force.
Hey, we're tracking all these
different goods and services and
here's how the price changes.
And here's how the price changed
over, you know, whatever period
we're measuring.
So
he was noting that,
you know, inflation came down an
awful lot, but
they are now noticing that it is
beginning to rise up again.
Having talked to
other folks as well, I think
Lachman Chuthen, when I
had him on the program a few weeks
ago, he had said that
that disinflation is largely ended
in a lot of other
regions around the world and
inflation is beginning to tick back
up there, too.
So we just had the
here in the States, too.
We just had the latest
PCE data come out this
week, Lance, and we saw that
Supercore started rising again.
In fact, every component of Supercore
was rising.
So my question to you is,
what are the implications, do you
think, if inflation remains
secularly higher from here?
Again, you know, it won't.
And the reason is, I
mean, it's just, again, you can't
avoid basic economics.
So I have, look, 30
percent of people's household
incomes are getting eaten up by
food. Right.
So people have to make choices.
And you're seeing lots of it.
There was a great article in The
Wall Street Journal earlier this
week of people now starting
backyard gardens to
help supplement their vegetables
and intake there.
People are starting to figure
out, you know, substitute meals
instead of making steak.
They now make noodles with canned
tuna, those type of things.
So, again, that's going to
impact economic growth, ultimately,
as economic growth slows.
So does inflation.
So does yield. Inflation is simply a
function of supply and demand.
And as we talked about before, it's
just, you know, nothing's going to
go straight down.
You're going to get these bumps.
And so getting this little bump in
inflation based on year over year
comparisons is not surprising.
In fact, it was expected because
of what's happening in other areas
of the economy.
And when you're growing at three and
a half or four percent, like we've
been doing since quarter three of
last year, you grew at four point
nine percent and quarter three grew
at two point nine percent,
something like that. And quarter
four, you're at roughly
a little over two percent for
quarter one of this year.
Economic growth is slowing.
But because you have that tick
up in economic activity
because of the
money being spent by the government
and into the economy.
Right. And that's those
infrastructure bills.
That's the the inflation reduction
act. That's a chip back that's
creating this economic activity
that is going to lead to some
pressure in inflation.
Inflation is not going to nine
percent again.
No, it could very well
tick up to four.
We were at three percent recently.
So it goes to three and a half,
maybe goes to three, eight.
And then you're going to cycle
through this again.
And so it's going to go on waves as
it continues to go lower.
The implication for the market,
though, is, is that the market may
not get fed rate cuts nearly as soon
as they think.
So just as you keep keep
the thing on that.
I just want to put in a quote here
that came out today from Torsten
Slock of Apollo.
He said the Fed will not cut rates
this year. It's very bold
prediction on his part.
I know that was at Larry Summers,
who said a few weeks ago he wouldn't
be surprised if the Fed's next move
was it was a hike instead of a cut.
But let's just say that the Fed
doesn't cut this year.
What implication does that have for
markets?
Well, that's that's the whole point.
This whole rally has been this
function that the Fed was going to
cut rates seven times.
Then the market rally was OK with
only going to cut five times.
OK, well, now they're going to cut
three times in the first rate cuts
coming in June. So that's why the
market's been rallying.
And so when the
Fed when when the markets come to
realization, the Fed is not going to
cut rates.
OK, so let me just tell you, I don't
think the Fed's going to hike rates
because they've been too clear
at this point about
the need to stop hiking rates.
So they've been very clear about
that, that they are done hiking
rates at this point.
Monetary, monetary
conditions are tight enough for them
according to their statements.
So I don't think they're going to
hike.
It's certainly possible.
I just don't think that if the
Fed wants to create a
market downturn
to reduce some of the
you know, if the Fed comes to
the conclusion that I need to slow
academic activity, I'm sorry,
I need to slow economic activity
more and I need to get
unemployment up.
I can do that by hiking rates and
shocking the market because the
markets are not anticipating a rate
hike. So that would that would cause
a market downturn of 10 to 15 percent.
And you would get an
immediate slowing of economic
activity. Unemployment would probably
tick up.
And that would solve that would
create that. I don't think that's
what the Fed wants.
They're trying to do this controlled
landing thing.
So the easiest way to control that
landing is just to keep promising a
rate cut and then keep kicking it
out to the next quarter because
the market's addicted
to crack.
And so just like anybody else
that's addicted to something, I say,
well, I've got it.
It's right here for you, but
just hang on till next month.
Right.
And I'll give it a promise.
I'm going to give it to you next
month. Next month comes like, hey,
yeah, well, wait one more month
and I'm going to give it to you. So
the market will just keep dragging
out this view of, OK,
it's coming. I can see it is
right there. I know we're going to
get it. The Fed just keeps backing
it up, backing it up, backing it up
until they actually need it, which,
again, I don't foresee that this
year. I think the real possibility
you start seeing rate cuts next year,
along with much slower economic
growth and fall in inflation and
lower yields.
OK.
And as you look
forward, then, is it more sort of a
stagflation?
Right, where inflation's high, but as
you said, the economic growth is
coming down. So do you think just
from a mindset we should be?
No, no, no. Inflation will fall
with you don't have the economic
background to have stagflation
like everybody looks back at the
70s. Oh, that's stagflation.
You don't have that background here.
So we don't have the dynamics in
the economy to generate stagflation.
Inflation is going to fall because
once you start to get economic
downturn, services are going to
collapse and that's going to bring
down your inflation.
All inflation is coming out of the
services side of the sector right
now. So that's all going to start
to come down as that economic
downturn occurs and unemployment
goes up.
OK, I was just sort of thinking,
you talked about a GDP growth is
slowing, but you did talk
about some of the things that are
still pushing
inflation a bit higher.
Again, not up to nine, but could
get it to four for a while.
So for a while
we could have sticky inflation, but
slowing economic growth, which I sort
of think.
That's not really stagflation.
That's just, you know, it takes time
for things to catch up.
Economic growth is going to slow.
And then as economic growth slows,
you have a decline in demand and
particularly on this. And again, if
you take a look at our economic
activity, it's all in the services
side of the sector.
Manufacturing is still in
contraction. Services is growing.
So once you begin to hit that 80
percent of the economy that services,
then inflation starts to come down
because all of a sudden restaurants
like Wendy's tried to do
surge pricing that lasted for about
three days.
So they're going to try to do that.
But eventually at some point the
rubber meets the road.
And when you give up on services,
then the rest of the
deflationary pressure starts at the
economy. Then the Fed will
have to step in to try to navigate
that soft landing. Otherwise, you're
going to have a recession.
Right. Right.
OK, so I think you're kind of singing
my song sheet here, which is Mr.
Lag Effect, in that as
folks just begin to go on strike on
paying prices where they are,
the economy will slow and then
recession may or may not follow.
And then the Fed, if it was going to
scramble, if indeed it looks like
recession is beginning to win out.
Yeah, but real quick now, that
all goes out the window.
All that thesis goes out the window
if the government turns
around and sends $5,000 checks to
households again.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I saw. Well, I saw
an article
yesterday or day before.
There's a couple of people
trying to pass a bill to send
to give people a $5,000 tax credit
if they will buy
American made goods.
Now, that doesn't include certain
things.
But if you if you buy an
American made television or American
made, you know, it doesn't include
cars and a couple other things.
But it's kind of smaller,
small business type products
in that range.
And if you buy those products, you
can get up to a $2,500
for an individual, $5,000
for a household on buying these
American made products.
So if you do something like that,
you're going to wind up with another
spike of inflation because you're
creating demand against
the backdrop of a lack of supply.
OK.
All right.
I'm going to just give
a quick little personal anecdote here
about how.
I think
more and more people are going to tap
out of of existing prices
and maybe have to start substituting
in the way that you were talking
about creating their own little
victory gardens or, you know,
whatever.
I am pretty clean eater,
but I have noticed
in my town for
folks that eat pizza.
You know, we have pizza places where
you can go and you can buy by the
slice.
Right. And the slice is generous.
It's a it's a pretty decent slice,
but it is definitely a slice of
pizza. It is nowhere near a
a pizza.
And it's in and of itself.
At the lower price place,
I think once you
once you pay
the cost of the slice plus
taxes alone is pushing
your seven dollars.
And then when they turn a little
kiosk around and say, hey, do you
want to tip me?
You know, you're kind of in the
eight dollar range at the more
expensive place.
It's over 10 bucks.
Yeah. Right.
And that's for a slice.
So, yeah. So once the price of a
pizza gets to 10 bucks
or the price of a slice of pizza
that gets to 10 bucks, people say,
you know what?
I'm going to go to the store
and get some pre-made dough and
some tomato sauce.
And I'm just going to make this
myself at home and I'm going to
have a whole pizza for less,
a lot less, probably.
So, you know, we're
getting to this point where I
think
substitution is increasingly just
going to be forced on people
because they're just like I just
don't have the dollars left over.
You know, once I get my paycheck
and have to pay for this stuff.
Right.
Yeah.
And just, you know, yesterday
I went met a friend of mine.
She's a brilliant CFO for
another advisory firm and we've
been great friends for a long time
and about once every quarter.
So I, you know, we try to hook up
for lunch and just, you know, talk
shop, talk business, you know, see
what the trends are and they are a
space, et cetera.
And so we always meet at the same
restaurant, which
so if you understand most
people don't understand Houston.
But Houston is very interesting.
There's these little pockets of
wealth in Houston.
And kind of regardless of what goes
on in the world, these these kind of
pockets of wealth are
generally on face. And so, you know,
restaurants do great because people
are always you know, they have lots
of excess liquidity.
So they're always eating at these
restaurants and they're always full.
And so normally about once a quarter
we meet at the same restaurant.
It's kind of in between both of our
offices.
And this restaurant is always
packed and usually there's a waiting
line outside.
And obviously I'm giving away the
punch line here because I keep saying
there's usually a
there's usually a line out the door.
And the last time we went three
months ago, it was that way.
It was just completely packed.
We went yesterday and there was
maybe 10 people in the whole
restaurant.
And, you know, it was interesting
because portion sizes
were about half of normal
for the same amount of money, by the
way.
And there was there was literally
no one in the restaurant.
And again, this is one of those areas
in Houston where it's right by
a big shopping center and
very high end homes and
just a very wealthy part of Houston.
And again, it was just it was a very
interesting aspect considering where
we were just three months ago.
Yet at the same time, we all have this
economic data coming out that says, oh,
everything's just doing fantastic.
You know, I just you know, the economy
is great. We're booming.
Services are running, you know, just rip
roaring.
But again, very anecdotal,
but again, very noticeable.
Great. And you remember my litany from
last week where I read through all
those stats, which was the, hey,
if you're hearing on the news that this
is a Goldilocks economy and the economy
is GDP strong and inflation's under
control and unemployment's great,
but you're not seeing that yourself and
you're wondering if you're taking crazy
pills, you aren't.
All right.
Okay. So kind of on a related note,
we had some more jobs data come out this
week.
It was initial claims and they dropped
again, not seasonally adjusted,
and they're at a four month low.
And I just want to bring up one thing to
sort of just put in contrast to this
because increasingly whenever the
BLS is issuing jobs data now,
I mean, there's just this immediate uproar
from everybody saying like we don't
believe it. And even the Fed,
even the Fed in its minutes said
there's some real disconnects between
some of this labor data and what we're
seeing. Right.
So I'm not going to read it,
but I'm just going to show it.
Here's a list that zero hedge put up of
layoffs that have happened so far in
2024. And you can just see, I mean,
these are big companies.
These are big cuts, you know,
thousands of employees,
anywhere from 5% to 35 to 100% in
certain cases.
So don't forget the government of
Illinois that just gave all their
workers zero work hours.
Those don't count as layoffs, by the way.
They just have no hours.
Are they still getting paid the same amount?
No.
You're not really a worker,
you just don't get any hours,
but you're not laid off, quote unquote.
Yeah.
So their solution for paying for housing
for illegal immigrants was to take their
city workers and say,
yeah, you're not laid off.
We're not firing you.
We're just not giving you any hours.
And that may be a permanent situation.
We don't know yet.
And so part of my comment about this
is that all that list are big,
high profile companies.
And those are the ones that we hear about.
What you never hear about is the 50% of
companies that are small to medium size
private companies.
They don't report this stuff.
They don't report the playoffs.
The owner of the shop comes in one day
into the hair salon and says,
"Hey, I appreciate all of you guys.
Y'all are awesome,
but I got to let four of you go."
Whatever it is,
you don't hear about that stuff.
We've talked about this because
the drum I've been beating with that is
that's killer because that's where the
majority of jobs are created.
It's in those smaller companies,
which of course,
they don't have the deep pockets and
the resources and the ability to do
stock buybacks and all the other things
that a lot of those names I just mentioned
can kind of do to keep limping along.
So again,
kind of like your point of being nervous
about how stretched market prices are
from underlying fundamentals,
and at some point it's going to catch up.
I feel like we're all telling ourselves
that we still have this phenomenally
amazing employment market,
and we don't for reasons we can begin
to see more clearly in the data,
but also if we're looking for it.
I keep talking anecdotally,
but I just had a conversation yet again
yesterday with somebody who's currently
employed, has a job,
is just trying to transition to a
different company.
I don't know how many resumes they've
sent out and doors they've knocked on,
but they're just like,
"It's a really tough market to even get."
There are all these open positions.
Sure,
but to actually get a call back from
these companies?
In a lot of cases,
they suspect it's just people that are
trying to protect budgets.
I'm going to have the wreck open to
keep the budget I was allocated for it,
but I'm not actually going to fill it.
So I keep banging this drum.
One, because I think as goes employment,
as goes the economy and the markets,
we've talked a lot about that,
and Michael Cantor,
what's his hope framework,
and all that good stuff.
And by the way, folks,
I'm talking to Michael about having him
back on the program.
He's got a busy schedule,
but I'm hoping in the next month or so,
we'll get him back on for an update.
But I just want folks personally to
prepare for this too,
which is I think there's this narrative of,
"Hey, don't worry if you get laid off.
There are all these open jobs out there.
You can just easily get another one."
I'm not hearing very many people saying,
"That happened to me and yeah,
I found a great job the next day."
I'm hearing much more stories on the opposite,
which is I got laid off and it's actually
kind of like a ghost town out there.
So I just want to make sure that people,
if you are counting on keeping your job,
if that is mandatory for your financial well-being,
and especially if you're a salaried employee,
you should really just be asking yourself,
"How safe is my company?
How safe is my job at my company?
And if I were to get laid off tomorrow,
what would I want to do?
What are the doors I'd want to knock on?"
You might want to start knocking on those doors now,
at least just to see if it's even open.
- Yeah, no, this is something that we talk about a lot,
but we take a look at some of these jobless claim numbers.
These revisions are very interesting
because the numbers keep getting revised higher.
It's like, "Oh, jobless claims were X.
Oh, they were actually Y."
And we have all of this.
And even in the consumer sentiment data,
that's still just fascinating.
So we just had consumer sentiment out
and they revised the last month consumer sentiment lower.
In the last four months,
they've been dramatically lower
than what they originally surveyed.
I'm like, "It doesn't make any sense."
I'm asking Adam, "How do you feel about the economy?"
I feel good.
"Well, do you still feel good about it from last month?
'Cause you said last month."
"Well, I changed my mind last month."
It's like, "It doesn't make any sense
why there's revision data."
But we have all these revisions
and it certainly is suspect to a degree that says,
"How much weight?"
And again, look, let me be clear.
We don't have any choice,
but to give these indicators weight,
it's all we have, right?
But you do have to kind of sometimes question
the validity of the message you're getting
relative to what you're kind of seeing with your own eyes.
And again, we can't go by just,
we can't make portfolio decisions
based on what I saw at the restaurant last week.
It's like, "Oh, Lance went to this restaurant
and there was nobody there.
So that means the economy is crashing."
No, you can't say that.
Maybe there was something going on that particular day
that I missed out on, right?
But the economic data is all we have to work with.
We have to work with the data that we have,
but I think we do have to apply some common sense
to some of this as well and say,
"Look, I realize that some of this stuff is the way it is,
but it doesn't jive."
And that's that risk that I'm talking about in the markets
that I think we have to be aware of.
Right.
And folks, this is why
airplane cockpits have windshields, right?
This is why they don't just fly by the dials, right?
Because sometimes dials can be faulty.
So you just always want to make sure you've got the ability
to look out and say, "Okay,
are there really clear skies in front of me
or is there a mountain?"
Alva, I read a really fascinating article yesterday.
I looked up, I Googled.
You need to do this yourself.
Go Google top paying,
jobs that pay more than $100,000 a year without a degree.
Some of the jobs were kind of obvious,
but the ones that I had to laugh at was Life Coach.
So what kind of Life Coach are you going to be without a college?
I mean, am I going to go hire a Life Coach
that has not done what I've done in life to be my coach, right?
You never graduated high school.
Again, I'm not poo-pooing in college, right?
I'm not saying that at all,
but experience is a big thing when it comes to Life Coach.
So quality over quantity.
But the other two that made me chuckle
was Air Traffic Controller and Commercial Airline Pilot.
And the reason that those are funny,
and there's actually several more in there when you start reading them,
because they all require an extensive amount of schooling.
Yeah, you didn't go to college,
but to go to be a Commercial Airline Pilot
is hours and hours and hours of study and education.
They'll learn how to fly an airplane, pass all the requirements.
I love the last line of the article I was reading that says,
"These jobs are available if you're willing to put in the work."
Well, isn't that the work of going to college
and getting a good degree, right?
Not a degree of basket weaving or whatever,
but getting an engineering degree or a math degree,
something that's going to pay you money.
It's just interesting.
And the point of this is that there's no free lunch.
And at the end of the day,
we're going to have to all pay that price
and one measure the other to get to where you want to be.
But again, Google these jobs, and it's quite interesting.
Oh, all right.
Interesting you brought up the pilot thing, too,
just because I've got a friend whose son is 17
but is known for years.
He wants to be a pilot.
In fact, already knows the airline he wants to be a pilot for.
And he's actually going to, I guess, what I would call airline college.
And I don't know if it would be considered a college degree in the way that --
No, it's not. It's just considered certification.
I guess, but he's going to be there for three years,
and it's a crap ton of -- he's already got a bunch of hours.
He's already got his pilot's license,
but he's going to have to go there and go through the --
To your point, he's going to put in the hours.
He's got to do the work.
Yeah.
It's not easy.
And that's the whole point is like nothing's easy.
You can try to skirt corners and do these things.
Look, I get it, right?
College gets a lot of bad press because of what colleges have done,
and they require you to take classes that are just stupid.
It's like, "Why am I taking this course?
It has nothing to do with anything."
And a lot of it's pushing an agenda or pushing a message, whatever it is.
And so I certainly get that, right?
But to tell individuals like, "Oh, just don't go to college
because it's not worth it," I think that's a faulty message because --
and that was kind of the premise of this article is like college isn't worth it anymore.
Here's all these jobs you can get that will pay $100,000 a year without a degree.
You're still going to wind up getting educated.
Nobody's going to hire you for $100,000 a year out of high school with no education, no experience, right?
And this was an argument I made 10 years ago.
I said the problem with -- and this started right after the Obama administration took over the student loan payments
and took it away from private banks and private lenders because back then, back in the old days,
you had to actually qualify for the loan.
Your parents had to cosign for it, you had to qualify for it, and it was very specific on what you could use the money for.
And the Obama administration said, "Hey, let's just take that over,
and we'll just give loans for whatever we want to everybody, and they can just go to college, and it'll be great.
Everybody has a college degree."
And I said then, I said, "This is a huge mistake because the value of the college education was its scarcity."
In the 1930s and '40s, the average education level for Americans was eighth grade.
In other words, if you applied to eighth -- once you graduated eighth grade, you went to work on the family farm,
you went to work for the welding company or the construction company, whatever it was,
the average education was eighth grade.
So if you had a high school diploma, you were like, "That guy's a freaking genius, right?
He's going to be the manager."
And then we said, "Well, everybody's got to have a high school degree."
And so it had no value at that point.
So then it became the college education, and that was scarcity.
And now once you start putting -- and this was the problem I said 10 years ago.
I said, "Once everybody goes to get this college education, it'll rack up a bunch of debt,
but it's not going to have the value because it'll become the norm.
It'll become the high school diploma," which is exactly what now has happened.
And now we're in this whole big debacle of the value of the education, all this.
But the bottom line, though, is that you've got to have that educational structure.
It just has to be in a field or in a trade that has value to the economy,
and that's the message we're not giving to our kids.
So you're ranting on me, and we can't rant on this because we've done it in the past,
and I've got other rants we've got to get to.
Sorry, I won't rant anymore. I'm done.
That's right. We've talked a lot about this, and look, I'll freely admit,
I have been a vocal critic with the average college experience has devolved into,
to the point where I think I've made the statement, I think on average,
college does not deliver a positive ROI for the average student going through it
when you take into account the lowered standards and experience they get educationally
and the exploding cost of college.
So I've been a big fan of alternative paths, as we've talked about here,
and I think we've talked a lot about the apprentice model, which is a great one,
and that goes to the heart of what you're talking about,
which is you get to put in your hours.
It's almost like the Malcolm Gladwell 10,000 hours until you have true mastery,
and that's in value creation,
and that's in creating something that the market values and will pay you for.
So I'm right there with you. There is no free lunch.
All right, so we could talk about this for a long time.
I want to talk about it for just a minute, just to note it.
The question I was going to ask you to debate is,
how big of a deal is the commercial real estate threat right now?
Talking to Gordon Long, he thinks that that's high in his list of triggers
of what could get the system out of the hands of the central planners here this year.
I want to note a headline that there's a top Canadian pension fund
that's sold an entire Manhattan office tower for a dollar recently,
where they basically just said, look,
we're just throwing bodies out of the balloon at this point,
trying to just jettison weight and reduce our exposure to commercial real estate.
So you're beginning to see panic selling, is what that headline tells me.
So real quick, Lance, how big of a risk is this in your mind?
Well, I disagree with Gordon Long that the commercial real estate issue
takes the issue out of the hands of the central planners.
I think it puts it into their hands, and I think it's the opposite,
because you're talking about essentially to a degree the next financial crisis,
which is if the commercial real estate property issue explodes to some level,
all of a sudden you have massive defaults on commercial real estate.
Again, that's likely.
I mean, we're not over that hump by any stretch of the imagination
of what's happening with commercial real estate.
In fact, that is something that is going to be processing
for the next couple of years.
We have a big debt wall that's coming up,
particularly for a lot of real estate companies
in the smaller mid-cap space in particular in 2025 and 2026.
So what will happen is if all of a sudden you start getting massive defaults,
the government's going to step in and start bailing out companies again.
We're going to drop rates to zero.
We're going to do QE.
We'll underpin the banks on commercial real estate.
I mean, look, you just had Silicon Valley bank sneeze
with good collateral back in March of last year,
and we bailed out all the banks.
So again, this will simply be just the next iteration
of why the Federal Reserve has to come in and bail out stuff.
Okay, so I actually think you and Gordon are similar.
Right now there's a central planner organized tranquility to things.
This could be the thing that adds a lot of turbulence to it
to the point then when you're saying they have to come in big enough,
they have to come in and start doing these big --
Right, and that's what I meant by putting it back into their hands.
I think Gordon would agree with that, just to be super clear.
Okay, well, I'm sorry.
I haven't heard the interview, and so we probably agree.
But I guess my point is right now everybody kind of --
It's like that thing in the room that nobody's paying attention to
all of a sudden just gets everybody by surprise.
Is it gets it by surprise or is the thing in the room,
the elephant in the room, nobody's just acknowledging
until it actually starts stomping around?
I guess that's what I'm trying to say is that everybody is aware.
Everybody is aware of commercial real estate issue.
Everybody's aware of it.
We all know about it.
We've all talked about it.
And as long as nothing blows the thing up, then we're okay.
And again, maybe what happens is that all these companies
like this Canadian pension fund,
they just start liquidating their assets at ridiculous prices,
which transfers the -- gets rid of the risk on their balance sheet.
They just take a heavy, heavy loss.
They write it off their books.
The rest of the market's okay right now, so it's not a major impact.
Then somebody else picks up that property
at a deeply discounted price and they have a good asset going forward
because they buy it at such a deep discount.
If enough of that occurs to get all of these properties repositioned
and get that debt off the books and the banks take the hit
a little bit over time, you're probably okay.
The risk is something that happens that causes an immediate default
across the platform all at once.
That's the Lehman moment.
You have a default with Lehman and everybody just stopped.
They said, "We don't trust anybody.
We're not going to trade with anybody."
That's what caused the problem.
If they had just slowly unwound Lehman very quietly in the background,
probably would have never had a financial crisis.
But I think that's a lesson the Fed learned,
and I think what the Fed will do is lean on these banks in particular
behind the scenes to very quietly deleverage themselves
in these areas to keep that from happening.
I may be wrong, but we'll see.
All right, and like I said, we could talk about this for a lot longer.
Maybe we will next time.
All right, just in wrapping up, here's just some news you can use.
For anybody who's watching that tax time is coming,
if you are in need of a new CPA,
just be aware that there is a massive shortage right now of accountants.
75% of CPAs are now at retirement age.
I've had a couple of people approach me saying they're looking for an accountant.
In fact, I am now shopping around too.
Initially, every door I was knocking on just said, "I'm sorry,
but we're just not taking new customers right now."
I got online trying to figure out what's going on.
I learned that there's this massive shortage going on now.
It's just something to be really aware of, especially again,
if you have an accountant who's near retirement age,
you should be looking around for their successor if they're a one-man shop,
if they're not going to transition to somebody who's additionally on their staff,
because this is not a problem that it seems is going to go away anytime soon
unless everybody says, "Well, AI is going to ride to the rescue."
The IRS is hiring a bunch of auditors.
It doesn't mean that that's going to help you out.
It probably means the fact you need to have a good accountant to do your books even more.
I've actually raised this on Twitter,
and a lot of accountants have chimed in and said,
"Yeah, it's the real deal in our industry."
A lot of them said, "I'm even getting near to the end myself."
The people who are saying, "AI is going to ride to the rescue here,"
they're saying, "Maybe."
They're even saying, "I'd love that because I'm overworked."
But it certainly doesn't seem to be riding to the rescue in time.
Obviously, goofs like this week's troubles with Google Gemini don't inspire.
You don't want your AI hallucinating details about your tax returns.
AI is not going to replace real people until we've got really good confidence
that those hallucination risks are over.
Anyways, the point I just want to make is if you are in need of an accountant,
start beating the pavement soon because this process takes a while
to find a good one who's still willing to take people on in their practice.
If you've got a good one but they're further in their career,
don't get too complacent because if you all of a sudden find that they're retiring,
you've got to find a successor.
It's not easy pickings out there right now.
Lance, I'm guessing you hear the same from your clients?
I do, and I was just Googling what you were talking about right now
about how many students are becoming accountants in college.
A lot fewer.
Yeah, the total projected accounting enrollments are down 4% from the highs in 2016.
This is a 2019 that's fallen even further.
Again, this is what I was talking about earlier with choices in college.
Here's an opportunity that is a high-paying job,
and there's a real lack of bodies in that space,
so here's a great career to go get a college degree in that will pay for itself down the road.
You should have a lot of job security, especially given where things are going tax-wise.
Here's a quote from one of those accountants that responded on Twitter.
He said, "I'm an accounting and finance professor.
We cannot train or educate enough prospective CPA students to even come close to satisfying the demand."
Again, I don't think much of us think about the tax or accounting world if we don't have to,
but it's a reality of our lives, and it's in crisis,
and that crisis is going to spill over into those of us who aren't paying attention.
All right, well, for this week's rant, and we'll keep it short,
I was having this discussion with my daughter the other night,
and I left it not feeling so great,
and I want to share why because I think it's instructive for folks.
We're going on vacation in two weeks right after the spring conference here,
the online conference for thoughtful money.
I'm going to go rest and relax, but it's also her spring break, and that's her last spring break at home.
She's a senior in high school, so we want to make sure she has a good one.
We were talking about vacations, and she was like, "All right, Dad,
are you really going to be able to relax on this vacation?"
I'm like, "Yeah, I always relax on vacations."
She was like, "No, you don't."
I was like, "Really?"
She's like, "Yeah, sometimes you get so intense about work that it's hard for me to relax."
I was like, "Really? Can you give me an example?"
We kind of went back and forth.
Look, I know that my tendency is to be a bit of a workaholic,
so I'm sure there's definitely real truth on her side of the equation,
but I like to think of myself as a pretty easygoing guy and whatnot,
but clearly, she has a different experience.
It really got me reflecting because she's my last child.
She's leaving the house, and I'm just sort of thinking like,
"It bothers me that she has these sort of negative associations about vacations,
at least where my work is involved."
It got me thinking about that old expression,
"It's not what you do for people that they remember.
It's how you made them feel that that's what they remember."
It really got me sort of processing.
It's sort of like a Dr. Phil moment where on his show,
somebody would be ranting about how they're totally right,
and he's like, "Yeah, but how's that working out for you?"
Sometimes you can win the battle but lose the war.
As a parent, I've been just sort of wrestling with the like,
"Yeah, I guess I sort of lost the war on providing happy vacations for my kids."
Look, she said, "Look, Dad, it's not like you're retiring,
and I don't have these happy memories."
She was just like, "I just kind of remember you as always being a little too down the work hole."
So I'm taking from that, all right, well,
that's something I got to really be much more mindful about going forward,
starting with this new vacation.
But also, too, there's the other side of that coin.
Maybe we're back to the Genoesean topic here, the two-sided topic,
which is sometimes as a parent, you have to prioritize what your role is going to be.
For me, being a provider, I look back and reflect on some of those vacations where I had to work.
Part of me doesn't regret it where I was sort of like, "Well, look,
it was important for me to make sure that whatever I was setting up
so that I could support my family was getting set up and being managed well."
So it's this kind of push and pull of who we want to be and what we want to be remembered for.
Sometimes those can be in conflict.
Sometimes you can't be the happy-go-lucky guy and the provider at the same time
if the situation doesn't allow you to be both and you got to make a choice.
I'm not necessarily trying to soliloquize here to push people to one side of being one versus the other.
It's just about being really mindful of that.
What do you want to be remembered for?
It'll hurt my heart a little bit that I'm not maybe going to be remembered so much as the fun vacation dad,
but when all is said and done, if she remembers me as the guy who did whatever it took
to provide what my family needed and maybe sacrificed some of his quality of life
to make sure that the family had a higher quality of life in total, I can live with that.
You're kind of nodding as I'm saying this, but you and I have talked about the importance of relationships
and we've had some losses in our lives that we've talked about here.
What you want to be remembered for is really important.
I guess my point is if you don't be really mindful of how you want to be remembered
and work to make that the memory folks have of you,
they're going to have whatever memory of you they have and it might not be the one that you want.
No, you and I have talked about this.
My work day used to be when my kids were little, when they were babies,
I would get up at five in the morning, I would go to work, and I'd work until five in the afternoon
and then I did a radio show from -- sorry, I worked until four in the afternoon
and then I did a radio show from four o'clock to six o'clock
and then I did another radio show from six o'clock to eight o'clock, so I got home around nine.
And so that was okay because that's what I had to do to build our business and the things that we do now.
And I was very fortunate that my wife understood that that was a requirement.
And so she took over that whole house role of making sure the kids were taken care of
and the whole time that I was working, she was like, "Hey, yeah, your daddy's at work, but he loves you
and he'll be home soon and he'll play with you when he gets home."
And they always stayed up a little bit later than they should because she'd wait for me to get home
and then I'd spend about an hour with them and they would go to bed.
And so she was very supportive in that role to making sure that the kids always understood
that what I was doing was important. I wasn't neglecting them.
It was just incredibly important for them to have all the things that they wanted to have.
And now, as they've gotten older, I've had this conversation with them.
We regularly go out to dinner as a family and we'll say, "What was your best memory about this or that?"
And they always go back to our vacations.
"Oh, remember that time that we went skiing in Towson and then this happened and that happened.
I love that. That's my favorite memory," or whatever it is.
And so they have these really great memories because we always spent time to make sure that we built memories with the kids.
That was my wife's always her saying, which was, "Nothing else matters as long as you build good memories."
And that's to your point, right, is that as long as you can build the good memories,
the rest of the stuff we all forget about.
I can't remember the minutia of growing up with my dad. My dad was a very strict disciplinarian.
He worked all day for Dow Chemical, then he taught tennis at night until 10 o'clock.
Then he'd come home and string rackets till one in the morning.
And he was very strict and very driven, probably where I get it from.
But where he failed was that he never created the memories.
So all I have is my memories of my dad being a very strict disciplinarian that worked very hard.
And I love him, right? I mean, he's passed away now.
And I love him. He was a good father, but I don't have tremendous numbers of memories where it was this really great time.
I mean, he took me fishing and that was his thing, right? He loved to fish.
So we'd go fishing on the weekends. I have those memories.
But, you know, I don't have all these other memories like I've tried to build with my kids.
And I think that's the important thing is it's not the quantity of the time that you give your kids.
It's the quality and being present.
And that was something my wife taught me. It took me 40 years to learn that.
But, you know, I think that's the most important lesson that she taught me was it doesn't matter how much time you spend with your kids.
Just make sure when you're spending it with them, that's what you're doing.
You're not thinking about work. You're not kind of half working while doing something else.
And that's why, you know, look, I've played Barbies. I've played video games. I do.
You know, all the stuff that my kids wanted to do, I always made sure and did it with them.
Yeah. All right. Well, really well said.
So, you know, parting bit of advice here is just, you know, for the important people in your life, ask yourself,
how do you want them to remember you and then say, OK, regardless of what happens and has happened in the past,
the past is a sunk cost.
What memories can I create going forward with them to hopefully help them remember me the way that I want to be remembered?
And they will, because, you know, the memories that we file away are the ones that we remember.
And so if you don't have a lot of good memories to fill right in the past,
then all the new memories you create fill those spots and they don't remember that stuff.
They just remember the stuff you do do. So, yeah, it's never too late to start. Just start.
All right, well, look, we're going to have to end it here on those words of wisdom, folks.
Just some important housekeeping as we wrap up.

It's better to do is what you need to do.
Well, also a reminder, folks, that the conference is coming up really fast and the early bird discount price, the lowest price we were offering expired yesterday.
But I because so many people email me the morning afterwards saying, oh, my gosh, I just missed it. Is there any way I can get it?
I'm going to extend it until midnight tonight. So if you're watching this Saturday, the day that this Saturday, March 2nd,
I believe that is the day this video launches, you can still lock in that early bird price just because
I don't want to get bombarded by all the people today to do it, but it is your very last chance to lock in that price.
So to do that, just go to thoughtfulmoney.com/conference.
And again, if you're a premium subscriber to our sub stack, you get an additional $50 off whatever price we're charging
by using the discount code that's been emailed to all of our premium sub stack subscribers.
Last, as Lance talked about, there's a lot to be concerned about in terms of market valuations,
overbought extremes, all the bubble issues that we were talking about at the beginning of the discussion here.
If you are navigating this yourself, I would highly encourage that you,
as I always do, work under the guidance of a good professional financial advisor, but be considering putting additional risk
management into your portfolio just the way that Lance is. If you've got a good financial professional
financial advisor who is doing that for you, taking into account all the things that Lance and I talked about here
and that my guests and I talk about in this channel regularly, great, stick with them.
They're extremely valuable and likely to be even more so if things play out the way that Lance thinks they could from here.
But if you don't have one or you'd like a second opinion from one who does, maybe even Lance and his team there at
Real Investment Advice, then consider scheduling a free portfolio consultation with them.
I can't really think of any reason why you wouldn't want to do it. It's just free additional guidance that you can take
into account or not. Totally up to you. To do that, just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com, fill out the short form there,
hear what they have to say after they understand your personal situation and give you whatever advice they have.
As a reminder, these things are totally free. They don't cost you anything. There's no commitment to work with these guys.
It's just a free public service that they offer. All right, with that being said, Lance, as usual, I'm going to let you have the last word.
Well, really, I mean, we'll just continue to kind of navigate the markets the way they are. Again, we publish a lot of work on our
website at RealInvestmentAdvice.com. Daily market commentaries, a lot of stuff that in between Saturday and Saturday, you can get
