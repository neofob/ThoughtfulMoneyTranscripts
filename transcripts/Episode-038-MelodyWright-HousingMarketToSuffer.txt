Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. The
US real estate market remains frozen, transactions are at multi decade lows,
mortgage rates remain painfully high, and home prices are at near record
levels of unaffordability. As we enter 2024, should we expect things to
get better for housing, or worse? For answers, we turn to mortgage lending
expert and housing analyst, Melody Wright. She's been busy visiting many
of America's most popular
housing markets to develop a true boots on the ground understanding of
where the trends are headed. Melody, thank you so much for joining us today.
Thank you, Adam, and thank you for having me.
Oh, gosh, it's always a pleasure. Thank you for coming back on. Our last
interview that we did a couple of months ago really was a blowout. I mean,
folks really loved it, and they really appreciated your boots on the ground
intelligence that I just mentioned there in the intro of flying to these
markets, getting in your car, driving around,
and my big takeaway from that interview was that there's a lot of stuff
going on that is not making its way into the official reporting systems on
housing. So I know you were finding lots of inventory that actually was
not an MLS, which was interesting because not only does that impact what
consumers see when they're out there looking for a house, but it impacts
the data that not just realtors, but housing analysts like yourself look at.
And so a lot of what's being reported isn't taking into account the full
picture. Very curious if that's still the case. Lots of questions I got
for you here, including if we have time at the end, maybe identifying some
interesting behavior patterns that are beginning to emerge amongst
transactors in real estate, where even though the market is frozen, like I
said, people are creative and they're finding interesting ways to transact
and kind of get around some of this stuff or at least reduce the pain of
the current economics here.
So anyways, lots to talk about. You've been nodding your head as I've been
saying all this, so good. I'm super excited with what you've got to say. To
kick it off, can we just start at a very high level with this question? What's
your current assessment of the US housing market?
So I think things are about to get a little interesting, Adam, especially
in Florida. So, you know, we saw those rate drops at the end of the year
and we're sort of kind of staying at the same place right now for the last
week or so.
But I think what those rate drops are going to do is actually bring out
a lot more sellers who think it's a good time to list because they think
that the demand is going to be out there.
So it's very early. I do think there's going to be demand. And let me say
that there's always demand due to, you know, things outside of our control.
But what's happened so far is that mortgage applications in the first
couple of weeks were actually down just in both in a seasonally adjusted
and non-seasonally adjusted.
This last week, they were up for refinance, which is not a sign of consumer
health because that means that a higher interest rate mortgage is a better
option than, you know, some of the debt that they're carrying.
But purchases were still down on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, 16%
year over year. And as we know, last year wasn't great either.
So these are pretty, pretty abysmal numbers. But, you know, Yahoo Finance came
out, I think today or yesterday with an article that bidding wars are around
the corner and we're about to, you know, enter into this crazy market again.
I just noticed right before getting on here with you that Zillow apparently
increased its home price appreciation projections for 2024.
They were at zero, I think, basically flat market predicted. And now I
think they're saying like 3%, 3.4 or something like that.
So yeah, there's this seems like there's this optimism creeping into the
analysts viewpoint.
Yeah, it's wild. And even people I would have expected to be a little bit
more sober about the move got real excited.
I think maybe because that first move was just so fast and it dropped so
quickly and everybody thought, okay, we're going to just keep on going down,
you know.
But I think that that optimism is a little early. I think that I, and I
think that's because people don't understand a lot of the stuff that you
were talking about, Adam, that there's, there's more going on under the
surface than most people know.
And so, but to me, this is when things are really about to get interesting
because it might prove the narrative false, right?
That even Fannie Mae has proved it false. They did a survey, they came back
and said, you know what, we were wrong that the lock-in effect was having
this outsized impact.
It has some, but you know, that's not really what homeowners were talking
that much about.
And so I thought that was very fascinating, but what's going on right now
in Florida?
So typically between December and January, you see really big drops in
housing inventory. It's just a seasonal thing. The average is around 10%.
You know, so in Florida, that has not happened. And in fact, you're just
seeing some really kind of crazy increases.
And so I think we're going to test the theory out there early about what
these rate drops are going to do, what the behavior is.
And I can say already that what we're seeing is a lot of price drops,
especially in these oversaturated markets like Lakewood Ranch and some
other Florida markets.
And so, you know, to me, as much as things are feeling very muddy from an
economic perspective, I think we're all kind of looking ahead about is 24
going to be like 23 where everybody is wrong?
You know, we were all just, you know, expecting certain things to happen,
especially because of the election. You know, we'll talk about that.
But I think this this could be very interesting to sort of prove out the
fact that really part of what happened last year is borrowers saying no to
prices, not rates necessarily.
And so I'm kind of excited about the spring selling season because I think
we might actually in certain markets start to get true price discovery.
So, you know, generally for the housing market, I don't think this is going
to be, you know, a banner year.
Put it that way. We're not going to go gangbusters again, but I do think
there's going to be activity.
I think there's going to be some up and down sort of moves similar, you know,
sideways moves to what we saw last year.
But I do think we'll end the year down with price like an aggregate price
decline.
And I'm very different from most of the formal forecasts out there.
But I really think if nothing else changes that we will see price declines
overall this year.
OK, well, that will be interesting. That indeed happens. So on your latest
substack, you just issued an article titled Gale Force Wins.
Yes. And in there, you basically said, if I'm remembering correctly, the
most important thing about 2024 is going to be what was the most important
thing in 2023,
which is narrative. And you just mentioned it really briefly that maybe
some data is coming out that is showing the narrative that was held in 2023
might not have been completely accurate.
As you look to 2024, what do you expect the narrative to be? How do you
expect it to evolve, if at all?
Well, I think it's going to be what Yahoo Finance just did.
And I think, you know, they're going to they're going to do everything in
their power to kind of generate buzz about the recovery of the housing market.
I mean, you know, the builders were at an all time high, even with sales
down and their revenues down and margins down.
So I think it's going to be very similar and just pumping this false idea
that, you know, we're still in an inventory constrained environment, you know,
but with these rate drops and sort of the new builds, you should be able
to get a good deal.
But I think that the narrative will start to get challenged, especially if
we start to see in Florida that, you know, the kind of activity I expect
in the spring,
one of the reasons that the narrative sustained last year is because the
the builders don't have to record those sales concessions and they off,
you know, essentially in the MLS.
So we don't know for sure what those true prices were. And that's not
reflected.
And so and then is your suspicion that they were maybe more generous than.
They are being discussed like maybe they're discounting even more aggressively
than folks really expected just to be able to move inventory.
That could be. But let's say you bought a home for four hundred thousand. They
paid twenty five thousand on your closing costs.
They paid your HOA fees of about ten thousand the first year and they gave
you a washer and dryer.
You know, let's say that's fifty thousand dollars of concessions that
nobody's taking off that top line price and it gets recorded as a four
hundred thousand dollar sale.
So essentially, you've got a house for three hundred and fifty thousand
dollars versus four hundred thousand.
And that's not recorded now. Excuse me. In the MLS, there's supposed to be
a place where you do record those concessions.
But Fannie Mae and its letter to appraisers at the end of the year said
that they did a sample of seven point six million comparables and found
that fifty eight percent of those appraisals did not take into consideration
those concessions.
And so it is very likely, at least in fifty eight percent of transactions,
that you have an inflated appraisal.
And so, you know, these are the types of things. All this is just sort of
coming out, trickling out.
And I think, you know, there's going to be a lot of push against these
narratives. There's going to be a lot of press out there.
But I think we might, you know, as we get closer to the election, I think
reality might actually be peeking through all of that.
And I think that there's sometimes and it doesn't seem like it, you know,
it seems like kind of this couldn't happen.
But I think the momentum in Florida might be able to actually combat the
narrative, but we'll know more by the middle of the year.
OK. And you're focused on Florida because it has some of the hotter markets
in the country.
You know, Miami, certainly, but a few others as well, in my knowledge. Correct
me if I'm wrong.
It has kind of resisted the corrective trends that we've seen in some of the
other previously hot markets that that actually are seeing price declines
like the Austins of the world and whatnot. Right.
So are you watching Florida so closely? Because it's sort of like if that
if that strong market breaks, then all the others are probably even more
vulnerable.
Absolutely. Because you have so much speculation there, because you have so
much second home ownership, because you actually have a lot of international
ownership.
You know, this is a mark. And it's also one of the largest housing markets
along with California and Texas.
And so, you know, we saw the trouble in California. We saw the trouble in
Texas. I would argue we're not done with the trouble in Texas.
It's just still beginning. But Florida has not, to your point, and that's
a great point, has not really shown that kind of distress.
In fact, you know, if you look at kind of the top 20 list places that we
had price declines last year, there was only one or two Florida communities.
But when you start hitting places like Miami, which have been featured so
much in the news because of things like Ken Griffin going down there with
Citadel, you know, now Jeff Bezos.
But when you start seeing the stress in those markets, I think it has the
power to sort of change the national narrative.
And there's a lot of history in Florida. You can read books like Bubble in
the Sun or Swamp Peddlers.
And in fact, Bubble in the Sun argues that the Great Depression was actually
caused because of the speculation on land in Florida.
And so this is not new to Florida. And what's crazy about when I was there
is I, you know, I spent 2012 and 2013 helping to manage the default crisis
down there.
So to go back and see speculation in those areas again was just so wild,
you know, because you thought it would never happen again.
Well, and that's what I was going to ask this question, but you've kind
of preempted it, which is, doesn't Florida have a history of extreme booms
and extreme busts?
And to kind of try to paint Florida as like, oh, there's a bulletproof
market. It's kind of like, why would you make that assumption given that
every other cycle in the past hundred plus years,
you know, it's been a widow maker for speculators.
Yeah, I keep asking myself those questions every day, Adam. And when I was
down there, you know, it's cognitive dissonance to go to these sites.
You just, you aren't believing what's in front of your eyes. And then you
come back from the road and pretty much, you know, a good people,
a good amount of people will tell you that you didn't see what you saw and
that you're crazy, you know, so.
But it's it. I mean, some of these places are much worse than what I even
saw there in the GFC. It's just rampant Lakewood Ranch.
I'll get some hate in the comments for this. Get ready. But they have over
21 communities.
I mean, and this is it's an hour commute from anywhere with a decent
job. There's not great cell service.
And if they were building affordable homes for retirees, it'd be one
thing. But these things are all overpriced and they're just building,
I mean, miles and miles and miles of these homes with nobody in them.
And so that's why we're seeing price cuts there already. But the rate at
which inventory is coming online in Florida, it's starting to scale scare.
I think even, you know, my biggest critics. So. All right. So definitely
want to get into inventory and I'm just trying to determine if we should
get into it right now.
Why don't we, why don't we follow my little logic here and then we can,
I can toss it out the window if it's not the right way to go.
I do want to, I do want to give you a chance to give sort of an update
on your travels and what you're seeing, particularly versus what you were
seeing, you know, a quarter or two ago on your travels,
whether trends are getting better or worse, whatnot. I kind of get the
sense from your tone here. They're getting worse, but I don't want to put
words in your mouth.
Let's start for a second. I'm just going to talk nationally for a moment
on these things and then we'll hit any market you want to hit.
Okay. So the market is still pretty much in a standoff around price,
right? Like you said, buyers or borrowers have basically said, I'm not
doing it right now.
Right. And I'm curious to hear a little bit more about this, where you
think it's maybe not the mortgage rates so much as it's just the prices.
Right. And you said earlier, I think you made the comment about the narrative
trying to be like, well, you might get a good deal this year because rates
have come down a bit.
And I'm kind of thinking like, you know, rates have come down from like
near eight to the high sixes. Yeah, they're lower, but they're still way
higher than they were two years ago.
How is that a good deal? Right. Especially when prices are still as crazy
high as they are. Right. So it's kind of like, you know, that's the like,
don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining kind of thing. Right.
So nationally, prices haven't really come down that much. I don't think
really at all annually. Last I saw, they had been down like a percent and
then they went back up.
So we haven't really had a national price correction yet on average, even
though certainly some markets are in correction mode.
I guess as you look into 2024, what do you see there? Do you think this
tension will continue for a while or at some point, I guess you're saying,
you know,
maybe the story is going to be inventory, that with more inventory, the
game starts to change. But I guess, do you expect an unfreezing, whether
up or down of the current transaction freeze in the markets?
I expect a little bit of thawing this spring. And I will say something
I put in my sub stack, you know, we look at the Case Shiller, which is a
repeat sell index,
or the Freddie index, the same. And that means that you have to use a property
that's been sold before and you put it in pairs to look at home prices.
But if you actually look at the median home price for when you include both
new and existing, we've come down from the top Q4 2022, about 10%.
And then if you actually look at these are Fred series that I don't ever see
in the news, to be honest with you. But there's a Fred series that also does
the median listing price, which has also come down about almost 9% since 2022.
So I believe we've seen some correction in prices, even though that's we
use a very lagging. What gets in the news is a very lagging index that has
all kinds of massaging that happens to it.
And I don't think it's the best for looking at what's happening right
now. But I do think there's going to be a little bit of thawing. I think
there is distress.
I think we'll talk about this pride later in the show. I think there are
shadow markets where these transactions are already happening, but we have
no visibility to them.
But I see because I actually look at these markets each week. You just see
home sitting there for 100 days. And the ones that are selling are the ones
that are coming down in price.
And you're seeing it all over the country, not just in Florida. So I do
think we're going to have a little bit of thawing in the spring. I don't
know that that's going to translate necessarily into an increase and a lot
of mortgage origination.
That's way more than what people think. But I think you're going to have
a lot of activity. And at the same time, Mortgage Bankers Association put
out an article last week that mortgage credit is constricting and it's the
lowest level since 2012.
And so, while we have this little bit of rates, we also have credit
constricting. So the pull through rate of all these new applications,
because it's just an application, it's not an approval for credit, it's
going to be very interesting to see.
Okay, so you anticipate some thawing. And this is multifactorial, so it's
really, I understand this is a really hard puck to call where it's headed. So
okay, let's now move on to mortgage rates.
So they've come down from their highs of 2023. They're still, as we just
said a few seconds ago, they're not affordable on a relative basis. So do
you have a strong opinion of where you see them headed in 2024?
Will consumers get their wish and rates come back down into the fives and
maybe on the way to the fours? And of course, the Fed just sort of surprised
everybody by saying it's going to be more dovish than expected and three
rate cuts in 2024.
The market's expecting, I think, like six plus rate cuts. So, I mean,
all of that could bring mortgage rates down a lot. What do you think?
I think if we're there, and they're doing that, there's not going to be a
lot of appetite for credit or ability to afford, you know, a mortgage or
buy a home.
I think if we get to a place where rates actually change, kind of, you know,
the dynamic and it becomes more affordable, like for instance, Ivy Zelman
did a study that if we get to about a 5% mortgage rate,
that's where she thinks that the balance comes back to owning versus
renting. I think if rates dropped to the point where you get enough activity
on the refinance side and then also make it more affordable, then we're
probably in a pretty bad situation at that point.
And I don't think that that would necessarily mean, you know, kind of this
gangbuster year for the housing market. I think you would see an uptick in
refinances very similar to the way we did back in 2010.
But I don't think it changes the trajectory of where we're going. We are
just in such a situation where affordability is so constrained, you know,
we've got a long way to go before we really change those dynamics and rates
won't do it alone.
Okay. Implying that prices are going to have to play a role in that. Okay. All
right. I do want to at your mark here too, that at some point I want to
dive for a bit with you into kind of the social implications of today's
extreme high on affordability,
especially if that doesn't resolve anytime in the foreseeable future. It's
just not a positive thing for a society, especially for younger generations,
or for older generations hoping to sell their homes to the younger generation
at a price they want, right?
So we'll dive into that. Okay, so now we get to the really tangled ball yarn,
I think, which is inventory.
Because there's so many different narratives around inventory. And we might
have talked a little bit about this last time you're on the program, but
for folks that didn't watch that maybe we just tackle it afresh here.
Does the US truly have an inventory problem here? Is that what's been
driving prices to these levels? Is it really true that we just have too
many people and not enough houses? Or is that a false construct?
I think it's a false construct. What we have too much of is speculation
in the housing market. And it started at the end of the last crisis when
the GSEs sort of made it very easy for Wall Street to come in and buy the
homes that were in foreclosure,
which they then turned into long term rental. And I think that that started,
I think, as these things go, those institutional investors got involved,
and then you sort of had all these fix and flippers and sort of retail
wanting to get in on it.
And as that was happening, they were doing the fix and flips, doing the buy,
rehab, refinance, rent it out, then go buy the next property. And that was
gaining a lot of momentum around 2013, 2014.
And so I think what's happened, and then you had short term rental start,
and people were like, wait a minute, I could make $1,500 a month on a long
term rental. Or let's say I'm in Nashville proper, I could make, you know,
gosh, like nine or $10,000 on a short term rental.
And so then people started transitioning into short term rental.
Sorry, just for folks watching short term rental, like Airbnb, VRBO, that
type of stuff, right?
That's right. And so, you know, this all started with the the idea that people
wanted passive income or a way in which to, you know, augment their finances,
or maybe they just were sick of working in corporate America, like me, where,
you know, wages weren't going up, you're doing the jobs of three people.
Nobody was really investing in productivity, they were, you know, doing share
buybacks and things like that. And it was a miserable kind of existence,
working in a corporation. So I think a lot of people, you know, as COVID
began, were looking for alternatives.
And then you had COVID, which in many ways, broke the social contract for
people that had been working at companies for years, and they were just
let go overnight.
And I think everybody realized, well, that could happen to me. And so it
just and people were stuck at home watching YouTube, and they were watching
all these videos about how to get rich quick in real estate.
And so everybody went out there trying to get theirs trying to, you know, get
a get one of these homes either to do long term rental or short term rental.
And then when they ran out of homes, you essentially had people like
contract developers to build specifically, these Airbnbs, you know, the
short term rentals.
And so and a lot of that actually wasn't tracked, it was they were selling
these homes on Facebook. And so, you know, there, the idea that we don't
have enough housing for our current population, I just think that is a
construct and it's missing the amount of
speculation that that has occurred since the end of the last crisis.
All right. Let me let me re ask the question in a little bit. Sounds like what
I hear you saying is, is we don't have a, we don't have too few structures,
like we actually have the buildings themselves.
But speculators now own such a large share of it, that they've taken out
of the homeowner pool, and are now in the rental pool, whether it's long
term or short term rental.
A, that's just a reality. And I guess the follow up question is, are we at
the point where they have, they own so much that they have shrunk the pool
available to buy so much that that is what is pushing prices up so that in
effect, the home buyer is having trouble finding
enough options out there because a number of them have been taken off
the table.
Yeah, I think absolutely that that's definitely, you know, one of the
issues. And I think too, when when you get to this point of speculation
and mania, there's so much embedded fraud.
And so I think things like the FHA program was used by these investors,
mom and pop investors and, and basically this is what we call non owner
occupancy fraud, but you could basically put down only 3%, take out a
mortgage, and then, you know, rent it out and and get income from it and
say to your originator that you're planning to live there for a year.
And so, and we've seen FHA borrowing, for instance, double since the
crisis. And so there are all these programs that made it very easy for
speculators to get in and start doing this and low down payment.
And so, yeah, I absolutely believe that you had people come in for spec
by these homes for speculation and it has, you know, led to increases in
prices and the other thing too are the 15 million vacant homes that are
not on the market.
There are a lot of second homes that the boomers hold that, you know, I
believe there was an article in Newsweek in October, I believe these will
be hitting the marketplace over the next several years.
Okay, that's tying into a demographic question I want to get to in a little
while too but I guess first question on this, this mortgage side so okay
so we've seen, you know, an explosion of speculative capital, go into the
residential housing market.
You know, to a certain extent there was always investor capital out there,
both mom and pop, you know, home landlords, also companies that were building
multifamily and stuff like that right and of course you want some of that
right i mean you want companies
building apartment buildings and stuff like that.
But now it seems it's really sort of metastasized and you know we've I've
railed on this channel in the past about the explosion in institutional
money coming into the single family home space where I really kind of feel
like it's got no business being in right
so you've got these hedge funds that own you know thousands or more of
houses, oftentimes highly concentrated in certain geographic regions and
that comes with its own risks and it's also highly unfair in the bidding
process for the house, where you get a regular
person who's going up against a deep pocketed, you know institution that
can buy in all cash and can borrow money at much lower rates, you know
they're just they're outbid before that it even starts right.
And then you add to that the fact that, you know, a lot of boomers didn't
downsize, or they downsize but they didn't sell the previous home because
it was appreciating so much they just wanted to hold on to it maybe rent
it out, treat it more like a stock
in their portfolio. Of course the short term rental phenomenon has taken
a whole bunch more inventory off the market. So I've sort of raised this
question of like, you know, geez, do we want to be on the trajectory,
where more and more of the country
is basically faced with no other option but to rent from their corporate,
you know, overlord here. And I don't think that's the case and I've already
had some pretty animated debates and discussions on social media, you know
about my aversion to that
and I don't think it should be a full 100% no corporate capital in this space,
but there definitely should be some pretty strong guardrails here. One man's
opinion. Question to you is, I think I read a little bit about a bill that's
been put forth
recently to try to get some of this big institutional money, you know, out
of the single family home market. But beyond that, like, is the sheriff
coming to town? Is anybody watching this at the policy level and saying,
at least having a debate of what do
you want in terms of the concentration or the allowable concentration of
this type of capital in there? Is it even recognized right now it is a
problem in the halls of power? Is anybody worrying about this or is just
the free market just being allowed to do whatever
it wants to hear?
It feels like it's more performance at the moment and people aren't really
interested in serious solutions.
I was just gonna say, is there a conflict of interest here? In other words,
like, is there a lot of like lobbying money coming from these agencies that
have been supporting up a lot of the current politicians? So is this one
of those topics where they
they kind of don't want it to get discussed?
I would imagine, especially with the role of private equity. I mean, you
know, and folks like BlackRock, which I think is just an extension of the
government. And so I think, you know, I don't think people are taking it
seriously because there's just too much vested
interest in the way that it's operating right now. I mean, over the summer,
didn't Biden go stay somewhere and the guy was like, no, this is just an
Airbnb. He just rented it from me. And then they realized it wasn't legally
registered as a short term rental.
I mean, these are the types of things. You know, the judges, the lawyers,
they own these Airbnbs. They own these investments. And so in our current
structure, I don't think there's a lot of political will to strike at the
heart of this.
And I think honestly, you could probably look at the tax code and really
start there to dissuade some of the dynamics we're seeing today. But I
don't think it's going to get a lot of traction. I think probably, though,
people will talk about it a lot on the campaign trail this year.
Okay, so what I hear you saying is, for those that are hoping that like
a policy sheriff is going to show up and clean up the town, not coming
anytime soon, from what you can tell.
It does not seem so. Not right now.
Probably like many things, the political will to tackle this won't emerge
until there's a really big problem, like maybe one of these funds that
fails and then dumps hundreds of houses all at the same time on a market
and just craters the prices there or something like that.
Yeah, and I think, too, though, I think people often exaggerate the amount
of ownership they have, these institutionals. And I think really there's a
lot more of the kind of mom and pop and retail out there that is going to
cause problems first.
And we're kind of seeing them implode some of them already in bankruptcy
cases and things like that.
Well, let me ask you this. Airbnb, I saw a stat not that long ago that I
think it said something like 50% of all Airbnb properties were bought in
the past two years.
So this was during the mania of coming out of COVID and revenge travel
and all that stuff. And of course, there are all these get rich overnight
courses, how to become an Airbnb host in two days or less. And a ton of
people jumped in because it was easy money.
As you were saying earlier, I'll have this asset, it'll kick off 10 grand
a month and isn't that awesome? And now the worm has turned. And a lot of
these properties, which I believe, I can't remember the stat, but I heard
a stat that
said that a good amount of these were bought with adjustable mortgages. So
they weren't plunking down 30-year fixed mortgages to get these things.
And so you have an increasing number of these properties now morphing
from being cashflow producers to cashflow money pits. They're beginning to
hemorrhage cashflow.
And you got a bunch of first time inexperienced landlords in the mix
now. And so presumably, that can't sustain. And at some point, a material
amount of those hosts just start liquidating like, okay, I thought this
thing was going to work, but it's not.
I got to stop the bleeding. Let's just sell this thing and be done. And as
we talk an awful lot about housing is priced at the margin. And so that
type of force selling amongst that cohort, while people always are quick
to tell me, wow, there aren't that many
Airbnbs relative to the full housing stock. And it's like, they don't have
to be. They just need to be enough to set the transaction price.
Exactly. Exactly. And, you know, I think this is already happening to some
degree. And so non-QM are the loans that these folks take out non-qualified
mortgages.
And they're about 5% of the market just for everybody's perspective. And
those are at a 5.1% delinquency right now.
Just to kind of give you some scale, when we went into about Q4 of 2006,
overall delinquency was only at about 1.74%.
Wow, okay.
That was Q4 2006. We know what happened after that. But 5.1% of these non-QM
loans are delinquent right now. And what's more concerning is the rate of
change. Like, delinquency is happening very quickly.
And for everybody that wants to say we don't have subprime, they aren't
understanding the definition of subprime. Subprime was both non-traditional
products as well as lower credit.
Well, we have non-traditional products like stated income, bank statement
loans, interest only, that you're, you know, kind of adjustable rates,
low down payments.
Those were kind of the non-traditional products. Then you have subprime, which
is FHA. These are borrowers with a 620 credit score with a 580 credit score.
And those are already at 9.75% delinquent, and they are 16% of the mortgage
market.
Wow.
So that's 21% of the mortgage market that is now way over the delinquency
we were in the late 2006. And so absolutely, this is happening. And I know
we'll get to this later as we're talking.
But I think that one of the reasons people get to pretend like this isn't
a big deal is because of these, you know, private notes and these subject
to or sub to deals and creative financing that are happening,
where I think more of these transacted last year than we know about because
the only way you're going to know about them is you're going to look at
county records.
There's over 3000 counties in the country. Some of those records are still,
you can get it via fax, you know, and you might have to fill out a form
and pencil.
But so there, it's just very difficult to know. And then some of these
private note sales, they don't record anything at the county.
And some of these what they're called sub to is sort of the way that they're
known. So, you know, I think there's a lot of transacting and distress
transacting that's happening, but we have no way to actually know because
they're not going to list anything on the MLS,
they're not going to record a sale. This is all happening between private
investors.
Okay, so this isn't banks making these loans. These are actual private
people, accredited investors, whatever people with money saying, all right,
I'm willing to give this loan to these people. And you're saying these are
sort of starting to blow up.
But because it's not necessarily publicly registered, we don't really have
a view into how bad the bleeding might be.
That's right. And a quick example. When I was onsite at a servicer, I was
talking to someone where, you know, we're not seeing them in foreclosures
yet. I mean, we're seeing a few of them, but just not at scale.
But where they're seeing them is in bankruptcies and investors suddenly
realize they're not in first position, which means that, you know, someone
else has taken out, you know, debt on that and they're before that investor.
That's right. Because they don't understand title. They don't understand,
you know, how we actually show ownership in this country, which is we follow
UCC and that's possession of the physical note.
And so there's a lot of pain. There's one Facebook group out there. So for
scale, it's hard to know how much of this stuff is, but 12,000 members. I
mean, this is not small. And I can tell you so many people have contacted
me asking me how they can do it.
I know that this is definitely bigger than what most people think. And there's
no way to gauge what's going on with prices in these private transactions.
Okay, gosh, this does sound like a disaster, you know, waiting to happen. I
don't want to be too doom and gloomy about it, but it just it's got the
smell of, you know, from previous cycles where things were opaque and you
had new people coming in and providing
money and then oh my gosh, how did it vaporize? Right? We've just sort of
seen this movie many times before. All right, well, I'm starting to look
at a clock and realizing I still got a lot of questions and don't have a
ton of time left. So let me get to
any update you care to provide about your recent kind of boots on the
ground observations.
Like I said, the last time we talked your general observations were, oh,
there's more inventory here than is being reported. Is that still the main
theme? Is it getting better? Is it getting worse? Are there other things
that are catching your attention right now?
Yeah, it's getting worse. And I and it's, it's shocking to me, Adam, because
when I saw what I saw last February, a whole year ago, I thought, you know,
awareness was around the corner, because how could you miss this stuff?
But, you know, I recently went out to Denver. I basically said it's just one
big new build site. I mean, and they have negative demographics there. They're
building every single, you know, spare piece of grass within the city limits.
And then way out, you know, 60 miles, 70 miles in the exurbs, massive
complexes in the middle of nowhere plump down into prairie grass, which is
highly flammable at the same time that Colorado insurance rates are going
up and taxes.
And so, I mean, it's just it's it's it's wild, but it's worse. And then you
try to look up those. They're not on the listing sites, especially these
new build communities. And what I noticed at the end of the year is that
certain builders in particular started pulling all of their listings off
of realtor.com, which is what the Fed uses for to track inventory.
They were listing on Zillow and they were listing on their own site and
still not listing everything like just a couple of cards, but they were
taking it off realtor.com.
And, you know, I've asked a lot of people, why would this be happening? And
I'm trying to find a reason that, you know, the one reason I think it's
happening, which is it's a way to continue to create FOMO.
Right. If nobody realizes how much inventory is out there. And some people
say maybe it's cost. I'm like, I know where the builders are right now. They
have to deliver. They have to sell. I don't think they care about an extra
whatever hundred dollars to list it on realtor.com.
So it's interesting. I think kind of to go back to one of your other
questions, I think the way that narrative can sort of persist is if people
can continue to create this FOMO and continue to say that there is an
inventory shortage.
Okay. Now when we talked a few months ago, you know, sort of raised the
question that like, okay, I understand that these guys might want to sort
of manipulate reality to make things look more scarce than they are to keep
that FOMO going and whatnot.
But at some point they can't just carry all these, the shadow inventory
on their books. They've got to make profits. They've got to start selling
this inventory. And you had said, yeah, you know, at some point it's going
to catch up to them.
Now that we're several months down the road, I guess I would think, okay,
we're maybe closer to that day of reckoning where they have to just start
saying, look, we can't carry this stuff anymore. We got to just do whatever
we can to get rid of it.
Does it look like we're getting closer to that sort of reckoning moment
for these developers?
Well, the advertising went crazy at the end of the year. I mean, you saw
all kinds of offers, you know, firstborn children, just kidding.
But, you know, it was just like, I mean, it was nuts what they were offering
and hey, if you sign up by this date, you know, by end of year, we're going
to give you all this money.
And so I definitely think they are, they know, they understand, you know,
we had 11 months non-seasonally adjusted inventory at the end of last month
for new builds.
So they are going to be doing everything they possibly can to offload,
plus probably talking to politicians about how they can pivot some of these
communities to affordable housing.
So I think that the panic has started, whether they say it to the street
or not, but they are doing everything in their power.
And of course, the larger national builders are going to have the leg up
and they're going to kill these small private builders.
And, you know, I think you're already seeing some of that with some of
these small local builders going bankrupt.
All right. Boy, you just mentioned something I hadn't really thought of, but
one part of the exit strategy for these guys, these new home builders, is to
be able to repurpose a development as affordable housing with the government,
where basically the government will come in and enable what needs to happen,
which is the lower prices to clear the market, right?
That's right. And of course, our tax dollars are going to basically help
these speculative home builders kind of avoid the repercussions of their
high degree of speculation here,
which is frustrating to those of us that are allergic to buyouts or bailouts.
Right. And Lenar has been bailed out before.
So there's precedent. Yeah, it's there. And I absolutely think that's probably
what will happen is that the government will subsidize some of their write
downs by, you know, using some of these communities for affordable housing,
which is going to be horrible for the one couple that bought in there before
that happened, right?
And suddenly their entire, you know, value of their home goes down because now
a community is pivoting to a long term rental, something similar to Section 8.
Yeah. All right.
I got stuck in a rant there. No. All right. So look, you mentioned something.
Well, before I even get there, let me let me get back to something you
said earlier.
You said that the narrative of people being trapped in their mortgages,
that factor might not be as big a factor as we've been led to believe. That
surprised me because I've kind of taken that as a large grain of salt as to
why transactions have dried up, right? Where basically people are just like,
I can't sell because if I do, I then get to pay a much higher mortgage and
probably trade down quality wise, right? Buy a lesser place for more,
which doesn't feel very good.
So help me understand why that's not as big a factor, perhaps as many of
us have thought.
Well, I just, you know, I think we talk about rates on Fintuit and the
financial community, but to your average home buyer, they're looking
at prices.
And so I think they found two interesting things in the Fannie Mae survey. One
was not nearly as many people.
So they kind of asked the question, are you planning to stay in your home
longer because of the fact that you have this low mortgage rate?
And quite a few less said that they were planning to stay longer or that
it impacted their decision.
And then for those that did say that, yeah, they think they're going to
stay longer.
The reasons they gave were things like one of the reasons was because of
the low mortgage rate, but almost right there with it was home prices.
And then another was I just like where I'm living. And so, you know, the
way that we hear it in the media,
I don't know, you give a number to it, but I'd say, you know, 80 percent of
these folks that have these low, unless they're forced or going to stay there.
And that absolutely was is not what they found in the Fannie Mae survey.
All right. That's really interesting. So maybe the seller's death grip on,
you know, I'm not going to sell it until all this corrects may not be as
tight as we thought.
Right. That's interesting. Look, we haven't even really talked about
recession risk and whatnot, and we're probably not going to have enough
time, but I presume a recession risk just sort of makes everything we're
talking about worse.
Right. It makes the gravitational force on prices much stronger. They just
have to come down the struggling demand from the new builders to sell stuff
that just gets worse.
Right. I mean, just sort of absolutely. All right. You mentioned something
else that I've actually talked about this week on social media.
And obviously, it feel like I really poked a wound for a lot of consumers,
which is people's homeowners and rental insurance policies just go into
the moon.
Right. So I live in California. The state, interestingly, not really that
much for the past year or two, but for the couple years prior, really had
lots of fire issues.
And a lot of insurers are either jacking up insurance policy prices now in
response to that or leaving the state entirely.
And I had my policy dropped by State Farm and really in elegantly dropped,
like literally just sort of called me like, hey, in 48 hours, your policy
is not going to be enacted anymore.
And good luck. Not even like, hey, go over to these guys who were still
providing coverage. Right. Just summarily like we're out of here.
And so I asked on Twitter, hey, who else has seen a big jump like this or
even getting dropped? And the deluge of responses that have come back was
shocking even to me.
And one of the things I noted is it's everywhere. It's from California to
Florida to the heartland and just gargantuan increases.
Some people seeing 20, 30% year over year, but other people saying like,
yeah, in the past two years, it's tripled. Right.
I mean, there've been some cases that were, I have even a hard time believing
where it was like it did been coupled within a year.
I mean, just it's bananas. And I think maybe part of it is because home
prices have increased so much.
And now the insurance companies are like, well, we get to rerate our policies
to match how much more expensive houses are now.
But then there's also all sorts of talks about whether it's climate change
driven or not. The rebuilding costs in a lot of areas has gotten a lot higher.
And again, that's probably inflation. A lot of key inputs have gone in
wages and materials. So obviously, this is something that puts just a lot
more downward pressure on prices.
All things being equal, it just costs a lot more now to insure these
houses. And if the gains in policy prices keep increasing like this,
I don't get the sense that this is a one time deal and that looking forward,
they're going to be flat the next decade. They're probably going to continue.
And I'm sure there's all sorts of other related costs around housing like
this. So let me know anything you care to say about all this.
But it seems like this is a really material new factor that really hasn't
been a huge part of the discussion until recently.
So just I wrote an article about it in October of 2022, I believe, or like
I'm trying to remember.
So it was a year ago. No, sorry. October 23. I wrote an article about it. No,
it was 22. Sorry.
Yeah, exactly. A year plus ago, right after Ian, because this was already
happening down in Florida and I wrote it for an industry magazine.
And my question was, what is a home worth that can't be insured?
And so it's another one of those cases where this just isn't something
anybody wants to talk about until they're faced with it.
And because I was trying to talk to people about it, get a lot of hate when
I talked on Twitter about it.
And then then the insurance increases came and everybody now is just in
total shock.
And that's one of the reasons why I'm looking at Florida, because they've
been impacted.
They already had their insurance was four times the national average. So
it was already a bad situation down there.
There were already people in the keys that couldn't get insured. But now
it's just this is it's impacting everybody, just like you say, Adam.
And I hear a lot about that it's because the insurance companies can't get
reinsurance and things like that.
They can't really hedge the risk. But yeah, this is a massive factor. And
of course, if the home's more valuable, it costs more to replace it.
So I think this is this is going to be one of those things I talk about on
Twitter a lot.
You know, property taxes and insurance aren't sexy, but this could take
the entire market down with these costs where they are.
And the taxes increasing as well at the same time. And a lot of the borrowers
that are in distress,
it's because of the big increases in their tax payments, especially those
that bought like last year or the year before,
because they get the supplemental tax where you are in Adam, California.
And they don't realize the lenders don't do a great job of telling them,
hey, yeah, this is what taxes were last year.
But your taxes next year are going to be based on a current assessment and
they get hit with that bill about a year after that origination.
And most of them have forgotten by that point. It's not. Yeah, it's just
not so.
All right, we're going to go a little bit long here, if that's OK, because
there are just so many key questions we haven't gotten to yet.
And sorry, my computer is making a couple of noises when you were talking
there.
And the reason for that is I was trying to pull up this article that sadly
just looks like it's got a bunch of like auto playing ads in it.
But let me see if I can pull it up here and not generate the ad.
So here's an article from Fox Business that says the old American dream died.
A realtor detail salary needed to buy a home, afford a middle class life
in 2024. And then here the subline, we have a cycle keeping people out of
the middle class, realtor says.
OK, so when you talk about narrative, I find that really interesting because
I think that realtor is giving voice to a lot of the pain that a lot of
Americans are feeling right now for all the reasons we've been talking about.
And the fact that it's a realtor saying it is crazy. They're basically the
last people you would expect to say anything negative because they just
want to get you into a darn house.
And so if we're seeing cracks like that, where OK, mainstream media source,
realtor beginning to actually sort of say like, look, we've got this housing
market that just like really doesn't work for folks.
And I can't remember the latest stat I saw on this, but the number of people,
well, I know in California, it was like the number of people that can buy
the average house in California.
It's like maybe 15%, right? And I think nationally, it's probably not that
bad, but it's probably not a hell of a lot better, right?
How do we begin to exist in this country where the median person doesn't
even have a hope of buying a home?
Yeah, and I think you know that I just believe we can't. And it's just gotten
so unaffordable because there's so much. I mean, housing is anywhere from
12 to 18% of GDP.
And when you don't have, you know, when most Americans can't participate
in it, I believe that there's a limit to how many houses the top 20% are
going to buy.
And even if you're an institutional investor, you're smarter about your
money right now. This isn't going to be a great investment, especially as
we're seeing rents decrease.
But, you know, the realtors and the loan officers are getting on this issue
because what's been happening in places where you are, Adam, and in Florida
is they'll get right down to, you know, ready to originate that loan.
And you have to have, if you're getting a mortgage, you have to have
insurance. And all of a sudden the property can't get insured and deals
are following through.
And that's why you're seeing a realtor be like, this can't work because
they're losing out on sales because of the insurance issue.
All right. So here's like where my brain gets stuck off and it's like, we
talk about all these institutional landlords, all this money coming into
the single family home market.
And it's not a super easy market to be in. Like you got to be a landlord,
things break, it's messy.
And yeah, when prices are shooting the moon year after year, like housing was
for the past five years plus, it had a nice tailwind at its back for a couple
decades now, but certainly leading up to last year, it was going gangbusters.
But once it stops, and maybe the prospects going forward become less sanguine
and maybe you're beginning to get worried about markets going down or whatnot,
and interest rates get as high as they have become,
it begins to look a lot more appealing to be like, well, if I've got marginal
money, why would I put that in another housing unit? Why wouldn't I just
park that and get a nice safe return?
And I think Nick Jerley had some stats he showed me a few months ago that
basically showed the all in return of being a landlord on average and
interest rates yields and the yields had surpassed it.
So it's like, even if they're close, it becomes really tempting just to
take the money and run, just put it in the T-bills and collect your check
and not have any midnight calls about broken toilets and stuff like that.
So we got that on one side where I'm just kind of like, how much longer
are these guys going to resist that comparison?
And then secondly, if people are really having trouble buying all this
inventory like we're talking about, then there's tens of millions of
depreciating wooden boxes across America.
I mean, just the more time goes on, those things are worth less with just
their embedded value. So to a certain extent, prices have to come down
because of that if people can't step up and buy them to maintain them.
That's right. And that's why, again, Florida is one of the epicenters
because all those empty homes are sitting down there with cracks getting mold.
You know, nobody's watching these. I mean, and there are so many empty
homes and of course, then depreciating of value.
And now we're also seeing all of these lawsuits against the builders for
shoddy building. I mean, this is cropping up everywhere.
And I shared a chart on Twitter just the other day about how claims have
increased builder claims against the builders for repairs.
And so absolutely. You know, these assets are starting to depreciate. And
I was going to say, you know, the institutional is when a home is worth more.
The only time that's good is if they can get cheap money. Right. But when
it's worth more and they can't get cheap money, then that that's not an
asset to them.
It's depreciating and it's not as valuable. And so so much of our system
is on the idea of collateral and what we can pledge to get cheap money.
And when there's not a lot of cheap money, then that collateral is just
not as valuable anymore.
That's a great point. All right. Well, there's a lot of my questions
here. I'm just going to jettison until the next time you're on here.
Let me ask this high level one and then we'll get to for just a couple of
minutes, at least sort of talk about some of these interesting solutions
or at least tactics that that purchasers are taking right now.
So obviously, Melody, I get from you a lot of concern over the distorted,
I'll say the deformed state of the U.S. housing market.
That prices do not seem to be aligned with sustainable long term value. What
do you think it's going to take just brass tacks to bring this market
into alignment?
You talked about lower rates. You talked about lower prices. Like, you know,
end of the day, what are we looking at here that needs to bring this thing
back into balance price wise?
15 percent decline, 30 percent decline, 50 percent decline, just sort of
finger to the wind.
I know you're not saying it's going to happen this year. Right. I'm not.
But I think overall, the path I see ahead for the next several years,
probably to at least a 30 percent drop.
And in some markets, it's going to exceed the 50 percent mark, especially in
these places where it's questionable about the quality of life living there.
And now when you can't even get insurance and all your other you know,
I do believe we're going to have some significant corrections in some of
these markets where it is just way too unaffordable for the regular American.
All right. OK, well, it's going to be very interesting to track this over
the coming years, Melody, and I really hope that you'll keep coming back
on here and keeping us updated.
All right. To put a little hopefully positivity, but at least just inject
something a little bit different here.
You and I have had a couple of private conversations about some interesting
things that we're looking at that people who want to transact, but not
necessarily at today's prices,
where they're sort of finding ways to do so in this era of record high on
affordability and very high mortgage rates.
So I think there's one or two that you've looked at, and then there's one
that I put on your radar. I know it was already on your radar, but when I
asked you about it, and we'll talk about that in a few seconds.
So what are you seeing out there?
Yeah, so I'll start quickly with sort of the private note space that I was
talking about earlier.
And, you know, there's just a lot of activity going on where essentially
people, just a regular investor out there is purchasing a note or creating
a note and doing private lending.
They may involve, if they do a ton of transactions, they may involve an
originator, but put it this way, you know, there's big conferences around
this.
There's Facebook groups and I've had several people contact me, but it's
called creative financing.
And I think there's a lot of above board people that are doing it.
They're like auctioning certain notes, very responsible, want to do it
to try to maybe help borrowers that might come into a bad situation where
maybe they're going into bankruptcy.
They can't afford it. And so essentially they're going to that borrower in
delinquency and say, Hey, listen, I'll take over your mortgage payments.
Essentially, and you're going to sell the house to me and I'll pay the
mortgage.
And typically what they do is then go find an investor to pay them and buy
that actual mortgage out from under them.
But in reality until they pay off the mortgage it's still in that borrower's
name.
And so what will happen is that borrower will be taken to foreclosure if
that investor doesn't make those payments as they promised and could impact
their credit.
So there's a bunch of this type of creative financing out there.
And then that sub two that I talked to you about, that's, that's kind of
where they do that. And they really try to kind of, they don't, they're
not evaluated for their credit, et cetera.
Instead, they just assume that they're not doing a mortgage assumption,
but they take on those payments.
And even if things are recorded with a County, the way that we prove legal
standing or ownership in this country is through possession of that note
and who owns that, who has that note is actually going to be the bank.
Or if it's a Fannie, Freddie loan, they have actual possession of that note.
And so there's going to, there's a potential for a lot of really ugly
situations out there where perhaps if you were trying, you know, you came
into trouble and you're like, Hey, somebody contacted me.
They seem legit. They're going to take over my mortgage payment.
They're also going to give me like $5,000 or are going to give me my equity.
But then what happens when that person can't find an investor to pay off
the loan, they're stuck with it.
And if they can't pay their taxes or insurance often, you know, the borrower
is essentially going to be the one that gets taken to foreclosure.
That's going to be a very, you know, unfortunate side of that, but this
has become a lot bigger than I think most people think.
I realize. Okay. So, so this isn't necessarily a good thing. Although of
course, if you're one of these sort of distressed homeowners or distressed
borrowers, it's, it's helpful because it's letting you stay in your house.
Right. And presumably these people that are issuing the private notes are
getting enough of a return that it's, it's of interest to them to do this.
But it sounds like you're saying lots of ways for this to get into trouble.
Yeah. And I'm all about the private marketplace. I really am. But I also
know how complicated this is.
And I know that some of the big players shouldn't even be participating
because they don't understand how complicated it is.
And so I just, I can see some of the trouble ahead, but I do think there
is a marketplace for private note sales if it's done responsibly.
But I do, there's also a lot of ways for it to go wrong.
Right. But it sounds like you're saying right now it's kind of wild Westy.
Correct. Yes, absolutely.
Is it, is it pretty much only being made to distressed homeowners or are
there opportunities for somebody who's got good credit just to get a better
deal on a private note than say from a regular bank?
Yeah, I think when interest rates are like this, you know, that, that could
be the case. I I've read a bunch of examples of like somebody, their parents
gave them a home, they had a home, they just want to get rid of it.
It wasn't really worth it. Give them quick $14,000, whatever. I mean, there's
certain cases where I think it just makes sense. And it's not about default,
but how most of these folks find those are through looking on county records
for people that are behind in their taxes are delinquent.
And so it is typically the strategy is to look for delinquent borrowers.
Okay. Yeah. And obviously with these things, when, when you're a delinquent
borrower and somebody comes to you with a good deal.
Yeah, it may feel like a lifeline, but it may at the end of the day, not
really be the world's best deal for you. And obviously delinquent borrower
in these situations.
They're riskier and therefore, you know, many more things can go wrong. Like
you're saying, so I'm going to kind of park this as a creative solution
that is happening, but when that comes at quite high risk.
Now, the thing that I called you about the other day, which maybe we just
talked about for a minute here is, you know, I had, it's always sort of
intrigued me, this idea of assumeable mortgages, right? Where if somebody
has a, has a great mortgage,
and you're buying their house, why wouldn't it be great if you could get their
mortgage, right? Had the mortgage transferred to you. And in a high interest
rate environment, well, geez, that just becomes super appealing, right?
You know, if this person's sitting on a 3% or sub three mortgage, and you
know, you'd have to go get one near seven, you know, gosh, wouldn't, wouldn't
you rather just, you know, buy their house and assume their mortgage, right?
And I know it's not super easy. You know, there's a lot of factors that come
into play. But it's been a thing. And I've wondered for a long time about,
well, gosh, how do you get in on this, right? And I'd stumbled across this
company. This is no way, folks, any endorsement.
I'm just mentioning it. So you can check it out on your own companies called
Rome. I think their websites with rome.com. And basically what they've done,
I just find interesting, which is they have created an exchange where you
can go to these markets that
they're in and find properties with current sellers who are willing to let
their mortgage be assumed. So you go and you look at a listing and it tells
you, you know, what their current mortgage is at and all that type of stuff.
And they're doing, they're removing a lot of the friction for you by doing
that because otherwise to go and figure out which homes have an assumed
mortgage and which sellers, which guy's looking to sell and is he willing
to do this, right?
It's very hard for the average person to figure it out. And I guess there's
a lot of paperwork and stuff, additional paperwork, you have to do with an
assumed mortgage and this company helps you with that too. So they kind of
hold your hand all the way through the process.
So again, I'm not endorsing this particular company. I just think it's sort
of interesting that people are saying, oh, interest rates are so high. I'm
going to try to find a side door. Oh, assumeable mortgage. Well, that makes
a lot of sense, right?
So you're kind of nodding as I'm saying this. You know, we've talked enough
for me to know that you don't necessarily say this is the best thing since
sliced bread, but that it is a credible, interesting alternative to think
about when presented with it.
Absolutely. And I like the more traditional route where someone is assuming
the obligation and part of what Rome does and part of this process is you
release that borrower from that obligation.
And I think that's really critical and the difference between what's
happening in this sort of shadow market and some of these deals. And so
I honestly think it's a great idea because the thing about anytime you
transact with the agencies.
And right now, the majority of these are FHA, VA and USDA, it can be
unbelievably complicated to figure out what you're supposed to do. And I
can tell you the most servicers don't even know what you're supposed to do.
And because you have to fully sort of underwrite the file, you also need
a connection with an originator. And so some of the servicers today don't
necessarily have that, although in order to service FHA, VA loans, they
need to have kind of those relationships set up.
And so I think it's a really good idea. And honestly, to give people a
marketplace where they can look this up in their area and then help them
through the process. And as long as the fees are reasonable.
But one thing I've seen inside the industry, a recent article two days ago
is that the servicers were complaining that basically this, because it's
re underwriting the entire file for the most part, some cases where that's
not true.
But typically, yes, they can't charge a fee high enough to basically pay
for their own effort, just because the way the fee schedules have been set
up. And this is with VA specifically.
But I definitely think this is an alternative. And I think in 2017, Fannie
and Freddie started offering it as an alternative for default loans, which
is a different situation.
But to me, at any time you make this crazy world of mortgage easier for the
regular consumer, I'm a fan of that. Because it is so complicated. And if
you know, why not let someone take advantage of that, that was going to go
out and get a mortgage?
I mean, it makes perfect sense to me. Well, that's what's so interesting to
me about this. And again, folks, I'm not endorsing this model. I'm certainly
not endorsing this company, but is the housing market is fraught with all
these affordability issues that
reality and I've just spent the past hour railing about. But that is one
of the great things about capitalism is when a problem becomes big enough,
when allowed to, the free market can start finding really interesting,
innovative new ways to start servicing
need. And hopefully, that's what we're sort of starting to see here,
which is as dire and depressing as seems like the housing market has gotten
nationally. Maybe this is the time where these are the pressures that then
create the new diamonds of the future.
So, anyways, I don't want to oversell this, but this is one of the areas
that gives me a little bit of glimmers of hope that, okay, there might be
better ways of doing this. And of course, we've railed in the past, Melodie,
about how the housing sector is run like a cartel.
The realtors protect all their information, very cartel like, same thing
with the lenders and everything about this. Anything that creates a fissure
in the wall of the cartel and let's sort of new innovation happen in a way
that's good for the consumer.
I'm all for sounds like you were too.
Same. I am as well, especially for these crazy requirements. Yeah.
All right. Well, thanks for going along with me again. I've got a bunch
more questions that we'll just have to save for the next time you come
here. Very important question before I get to the very last one, which is
for people that have really enjoyed this discussion,
Melodie, and would like to follow you and your work, where should they go?
They can find me on X Twitter @m3_melodie, @m3melodie_substack, and
@m3melodie_youtube. I try to write a sub stack every week or two weeks and
a YouTube video at the same frequency.
All right, awesome. Well, Melodie, when I edit this, I will put the URLs to
those up on the screen. Folks will also put them down in the description
as well. So if you want to get one click access to those, that's where
they'll be.
All right, I've got just a couple of quick housecleaning things to mention
here for folks. And then I'm going to ask you the very last question,
Melodie, which is going to be we've just been talking about housing and
financially related topics this whole discussion.
What's one non-money related investment you'd encourage folks to develop? So
think about your answer to that while I just go through the next 30 seconds.
So just want to remind folks that we have locked in a date for the Thoughtful
Money Spring Conference. That's going to be Saturday, March 16. I think in
my video with Lance, I mistakenly said the 18th. It is the 16th.
So more details to be coming very soon on that. But again, make
sure you mark your calendars for that. A reminder that my substack,
AdamTaggart.substack.com, not only do I publish a lot of free information
there during the week about everything that's going on at Thoughtful Money,
but if you become a premium member there, in addition to the other
benefits, it acts as sort of like a discount card for you for things like
the conference.
So we're going to have pretty substantial price discounts for the people that
sign up early, early bird discounts. You will get an additional substantial
discount on top of that if you're a premium subscriber.
So just want to let you know about that additional benefit. And if you've
enjoyed having Melodie on here, would like to have her come back on again,
hopefully maybe in Q2 to give us an update on where she sees the housing
market or even sooner,
if there's anything major that really catches her attention, please let
her know that by hitting the like button and clicking on the red subscribe
button below, as well as that little bell icon right next to it.
All right, Melodie, as we land the plane here, let's get to that question
about what non money related investment would you encourage folks to consider
adopting in their lives?
Yeah, so I really enjoyed Steph Pomboy's answer and I think I'll just kind
of build off that in terms of, you know, I think what we have not been
investing in is our relationships, our in real life relationships.
I think a lot of us spend a lot of time with our not in real life
relationships. But I just think that, you know, one non financial investment
would just be in the time that you spend locally.
Because, you know, I talked about housing, and I think one of the reasons
that, you know, housing has become a casino, is that people don't care
enough about where they live, they don't care about their name, you know,
we, we don't spend a lot of time with our neighbors anymore.
We're all focused on just our thing. And so I think investing time and getting
to know your neighbors, investing time to getting to know your city council,
you know, to really care about these things and and understand what's going
on locally and sort of maybe
fight these things locally, like Wall Street coming into your city, buying
up your homes, they're going to have hearings on that, you know, go to the
hearings. So that would be probably what I would recommend to everyone,
because I feel like we're going we're going
to be going into a very tumultuous time this year, because of all these
elections across the world. And I personally want to have a great support
network. And I also want to fight some of these, these trends, like the
institutionals coming in and buying up homes.
It's a great point. I totally agree with all of it, you know, real estate,
it's they always say location, location, location, right, I would say life
is location, location, location, because that's where you're building your
roots, that's where you're building your
community relationships. So obviously, you know, the more you make that a
focus, the higher the probability of getting the type of returns you want
on it. And you raise a good point, like, I'm curious of people watching here.
How many of you can name anybody, one person on your city or town council? How
many of you have ever been to one of those meetings? How many of you have
been there and made your voice heard on a particular proposal or project
or initiative or whatnot?
I'm willing to bet that number is pretty low, I'm going to bet it's probably
in the single digits. And I would put myself on the list, there are folks
that don't know nearly as much as they probably should about their local
governance, right?
There's lots of things I do to try to stay involved and make a difference. But
there's a lot more that I could be doing if I'm really being honest about
this.
And, you know, I talk a lot about the individual helping themselves first,
it's kind of like the airplane put on your safety mask first before you
help the people next to you.
And the hope for that is that we ultimately drive change at the top by
getting individuals to live their values, then demand that of their elected
officials and it just sort of like percolates up, right?
But you can't just end it changing your behavior, you've really got to
get out there and argue and nurture the change that you want to see in the
world and that means being really involved at the local level. So anyways,
thank you for emphasizing that and given
your position there in real estate, it's very fitting for you. So thanks. All
right, well, Melody, I love having you on the channel, I always appreciate
this discussion, the door is open to come back on anytime you like.
Folks, if you've got any stamina left in you, the video that just launched
before this one is with Dave Bianco and Dave is a very smart guy and is
never short of strong opinions.
So if you want to hear that one, I'll put a link to it right here. Melody,
thank you so much again. Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
