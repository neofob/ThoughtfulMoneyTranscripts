Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
When I think back on all the experts
I interviewed last year,
the one whose market predictions played out most accurately
is Darius Dale, founder and CEO of 42 Macro.
So what do his models tell him is likely to happen in 2024?
Well, let's ask the man himself.
Darius, thanks so much for joining us today.
- Adam, it is a pleasure to be with you, my friend.
Congrats on the new launch
and thank you for the kind words, man.
It means a lot. Appreciate that.
- Oh God, well earned.
I'm gonna give you a chance to do a big victory lap here.
Very quickly, thanks to you for soldiering
through this with me.
Folks can probably hear from my voice.
I got a little bit of a cold here
when I was going back to eat this weekend
to say goodbye to my father.
Looks like I picked up COVID.
The test came back positive this morning.
So I got nothing else to do basically, but sit around.
So thank you for letting me bring you on here
while I potentially expire from this thing.
But I will try not to do so while we're talking.
And let me also congratulate you.
Last time we talked, you had just gotten married.
- Yes, sir.
- I think you might have some other big personal news.
- Yeah, man.
So we're pregnant with our first child, man.
So God is good, man.
And like I said, I'm sorry about your dad, man.
I know you're going through a tough time
and what has been somewhat of a tough year, man.
But you're a good dude.
A lot of people are rooting for you
and there's great things to come for you, my brother.
- Well, thank you.
And right back at you.
And I love the fact that you are continuing
the circle of life by becoming a dad yourself.
So congrats.
- God is good, man.
Appreciate that.
- All right, so as usual, lots of questions.
I totally want to go into some of the highlights
from this past year of how you were able to call the market
as well as you did this year.
Real quick though, if we can start at the normal
sort of general question I'd like to ask you
at the start of these, what's your current assessment
of the global economy and financial markets?
- Yeah, that's a great question, man.
So right now we'll start by saying we are in what we call
a Goldilocks top-down market regime.
Last we were on this summer,
we were talking about our global macro risk matrix,
which is a sophisticated quantitative tool that we use
to identify sort of what regime the market thinks we're in
so that we and investors following our process
can orient their portfolios
and all their incremental decision-making
to account for that.
And then we obviously do qualitative research
and supplement that to help us understand
how long that regime is likely to persist.
And that's really kept us on the right side
of market risk, really not just this year,
but obviously last year as well
when we were appropriately bearish.
So in terms of my general assessment and lay of the land,
again, we're in this Goldilocks regime.
It's being supported by a rising probability
of a soft landing in the US economy
and green shoots in places like China and Europe,
specifically with respect to the rising probability
of a soft landing in the US economy.
You go back to the summer of 2022
and we authored the resilient US economy theme
that was sort of the underpinning of why so many investors
were sort of wrong-footed on both stocks and bonds
for most of 2023.
That resiliency persists.
We continue to see really healthy balance sheets
in the consumer and corporate sector.
And ultimately, if that resiliency persists
and we continue to get positive inflation outcomes,
we're going to allow the monetary easing
that is currently taking place in financial markets
to actually promote the business cycle forward.
And one final dynamic I'll highlight,
and we can obviously unpack all this in great detail,
one final dynamic I'll highlight is that
with respect to that rising probability
of a soft landing in the US economy,
one thing that I think investors are sort of
not paying too much attention to right now,
but they ultimately will be forced to throughout 2024
is the fiscal impulse.
Now the fiscal impulse was very, very positive
throughout 2023.
It's likely to continue to be positive,
albeit less positive at the margins,
but it's very unlikely we see a fiscal cliff
heading into a general election year,
particularly with an incumbent Democrat president.
- Okay, so I'm going to wrap that up and say,
it sounds like you're feeling pretty optimistic.
I mean, we could say guardedly so,
but pretty optimistic for this coming year.
- No, no, about as bullish as I can possibly be.
- Well, there you go.
- The reason for this is not, again,
based on my own qualitative assessment
of what I think is happening,
is that our risk management systems,
which are all quantitative in nature
and very proven and work very well
to keep us on the right side of market risk,
they are as bullish as they can possibly be.
If you look at our gold macro risk matrix, as I mentioned,
we are pricing in Goldilocks.
Goldilocks is a condition where gross accelerating,
inflation decelerating,
that's nirvana for most asset markets.
And that's further being supplemented
by our macro weather model,
which has a bullish through month outlook
for the stock market,
a bullish through month outlook for the bond market,
a bullish through month outlook for the crypto market
and a bearish three month outlook for the US dollar.
Those are all very positive signals
that suggest the current Goldilocks regime we're in
is likely to persist at least over the next three months
and perhaps longer,
given some of the fundamental research signals
that we're observing in the economy.
- Okay, and again,
I want to get to your victory lap in a second,
but if I recall correctly
from the last time I talked with you,
you were warning people that stocks could perform much better
at the end of the year than they were expecting.
We were talking in October
when the market was kind of swooning,
there was a lot of negativity that, you know,
the big run that we had had this year was petering out
and you had said, no, there's a lot of indicators you see
that things are gonna pick back up
and it could get really good.
We talked about how- - The party analogy.
- The party analogy, yeah.
And I think we were talking specifically
like heading into recession,
the stocks do their best leading up to a recession.
I think the analogy that we kind of co-termed together
was the party gets at its craziest
right before the police show up, right?
Right before the cops get there, right?
- 100%.
- And if I remember correctly,
I think you were saying, you know,
so you were pretty optimistic about asset prices through Q1,
but then you were thinking, you know,
there could be a pretty big corrective event in Q2.
And I think at that point, maybe you were still thinking,
yeah, there's probably a recession in 2024,
correct me if that's wrong,
but we're thinking that, you know,
we might start slipping into it starting in Q2.
If that was true, sounds like you do not necessarily,
a recession may not be your default assumption anymore.
- No, no, it's definitely not.
It's definitely not our modal outcome assumption.
It never was our modal outcome assumption.
- It never was, okay.
- Yeah, if you go back to that interview,
what we talked about was our yield curve analysis
suggests that a recession, if it were going to happen,
had the highest probability of starting
sometime between Q4 of this year
and the beginning of Q2 of next year.
- That's right, that's right.
There was that range, yes, thanks.
- It was that range, yeah, exactly.
So, you know, we had to be on high alert
for a rising probability of a hard landing,
particularly as we headed into Q4,
and that ultimately allowed us to effectively
make the call that, hey, this summertime swoon
that we're seeing in asset markets
was ultimately going to prove to be a bear trap.
And ultimately, there's gonna be a violent, vicious rally
on the other side of that summertime swoon.
Obviously, you know, sitting here in late December,
that was obviously extremely correct.
But I think the more important thing
we need to discuss today is how the probability
of a hard landing is actually diminished,
according to our qualitative research process,
and we can unpack that in great detail.
- Well, let's unpack that, and there's a number of things
I wanna touch upon in our answers to that.
You had said that monetary easing has been helping
and could continue helping things.
Of course, you talked about the fiscal impulse
being a big factor in 2023 and still likely
to be one next year, just maybe not as much.
I have been having this discussion a lot
in, say, the past week, week and a half on this channel,
of we have been told that we were in a tightening era,
right, where we've had aggressive interest rate hikes
and we've had QT to the tune of over a trillion dollars.
And I think the average investor,
because of what they're being told,
is it's just assumed that the pond was getting drained.
But I've talked to a number of people who track liquidity,
and liquidity is a little funky in the sense
that everybody kinda has their own personal way
in which they calculate it.
But most of the people who I've talked with
who do look at it closely have seen liquidity
basically been rising all through 2023.
In fact, it bottomed in October 2022
and has been pretty much steadily rising since.
And of course, that could easily explain
why the markets bottomed in October 2022
and then had a great year ahead of them.
So is this rising liquidity a substantial factor
in your growing optimism that we may indeed
not have a hard landing?
- Yeah, absolutely.
So liquidity is rising both domestically and globally.
This is something we've been highlighting
on our clients for a couple of months now.
The U.S. liquidity actually started to re-accelerate
in late October by mid-November.
Global liquidity was trending higher as well.
It has not been a linear recovery in liquidity
since the fall of 2022.
We sort of peaked out in kind of mid-April.
We had a reduction in liquidity that persisted really
through kind of, you know, September, August, September.
And then that really started at the bottom
and inflect higher in October.
And so that's kinda where we are with respect to liquidity.
We do continue to see liquidity.
If you think about the things that lead the liquidity cycle,
because I think we're, you know,
among the world's experts in this subject matter,
the things that we've found statistically
that lead the liquidity cycle,
things like the U.S. dollar, bond market volatility,
currency volatility, crude oil,
all those things that are moving
and are in a condition that would suggest
private sector liquidity creation is likely to persist
and be quite positive over the very, you know,
short to medium term.
I mean, as long as that is the case
and you continue to see, you know,
very dovish pricing and then the interest rate side
of things, it's a very bullish cocktail.
You know, I don't think you can divorce, you know,
what's happening in the economy
from what's happening with the liquidity
and ultimately how those two things interplay
with asset markets.
But the reality is a lot of this stuff is just bullish.
And if I could share a chart, you know,
well, let's just take it to the charts here.
'Cause you know, I think I'm much better in these interviews
when I can actually reference the data
'cause we are data driven investors here at 42 Macro.
By the way, everyone says they're data driven,
but what most people are is they're confirmation bias driven.
You know, they are data driven,
but they're only looking at data
that supports their existing legacy,
positions and conclusions.
We are data driven in the sense
that we are analyzing the same data every day.
It doesn't matter if we're bullish or if we're bearish,
we wanna know what is happening
and how what is happening is likely
to influence asset markets over the short to medium term.
So this is our macro weather model.
This is one of the more important tools
that we've built here at 42 Macro
to help our clients stay on the right side of market risk
on a consistent basis.
And what we found is that, you know,
we're in the current constellation
of the principal components of macro
are actually in a very, very bullish condition.
So we'll start with the real economy cycles
here on the left.
If you look at growth, it is currently trending higher.
It's expected to inflect and trend lower
over the next 12 months.
If you look at inflation, it's currently trending lower.
It's expected to trend lower over the next 12 months.
The unemployment rate's trending higher albeit backing off
from the recent highs.
It's expected to trend higher over the next 12 months.
If you look at the implied sales growth rate for the S&P,
that number is trending lower.
The implied earnings growth rate
for the S&P is trending higher.
Sovereign fiscal balance as a percentage of GDP
is trending lower.
That means the budget deficit is widening.
The real effective exchange rate is trending higher,
although it's peaked and it's likely to may begin
a bearish trend in the coming months.
We shift over to the financial economy cycles.
Liquidity, as measured by our 42-macro net liquidity model,
that's the Fed balance sheet total asset side
minus the reverse super facility balance
and the Treasury General account balance.
I think a lot of this has become quite popular
in global Wall Street.
That number's trending higher.
If you look at our global liquidity proxy,
which is actually a better model,
that's the global central bank balance sheet
plus global broad money supply
plus global FX reserves minus gold.
That number's trending higher.
If you look at credit growth, domestic credit growth
and global credit growth are trending lower.
The policy rate's still trending higher,
although it's gonna be trending sideways pretty soon.
The two-year nominal yield spread
relative to that benchmark policy rate
is trending lower and at minus 114 basis points
is obviously pricing in a lot of easing
financial markets and monetary conditions.
If you look at aggregated dollar and Treasury's positioning,
we're at a neutral signal there
in terms of dollar positioning,
and this is non-commercial net length
divided by total open interest
for all the major currencies and gold against the US dollar.
We aggregate that same metric across the Treasury curve.
That's an extreme bear signal.
We aggregate that same metric
across all the 19 components in the commodities market.
That's an extreme bear signal.
This plus 2% net long.
And then this minus 2% net long
is a neutral signal for equities.
And so we kind of just went through
all the things that matter to asset markets
that have historically created dispersion
within and across asset markets.
And this current constellation of signal
in terms of the trends or the regimes
that these various component features are in
are currently telling you that the stock market,
based on how the model is projecting
excess return dispersion from the rolling back test,
is saying the stock market has a bullish three month outlook
as does the bond market, as does the Bitcoin.
And what does bullish mean?
Well, bullish means that you should be expecting
higher returns relative to baseline and lower volatility
relative to the baseline of that particular asset class.
You should be expecting lower returns and higher volatility
relative to the baseline of the US dollar.
You should be expecting neutral returns
for the commodities market.
And so one thing I think is really important
in terms of answering a lot of these questions
is understanding, okay, where are we coming from?
Do you have a, yes, the answer is yes,
because we have a Bayesian process
to understand exactly where we're coming from.
And then we do the qualitative research
in terms of understanding some of the fundamental dynamics
in the economy to give us a sense of, okay,
how long is this current condition likely to persist?
- Let me just ask about that.
So your model there says these are three month outlooks?
- Yeah, it's a rolling three month forecast
based on the current constellation.
So we refresh this daily.
As you can see, this is the refresh for December 21st.
- Yep, so when you do asset allocation,
are you primarily looking at a three month window?
Is this in conjunction with other longer
or shorter term outlooks as well?
I'm just curious your process here.
- Yeah, no, let's take it back to the process.
So the process starts with understanding
what regime are the markets trying to price in.
Goldilocks, reflation, inflation, deflation,
those are all various economic conditions
that the markets can be pricing in at any given moment.
And how we determine what the market is pricing in
is we use what we call our volatility
adjusted momentum signal,
and we score every major market in the economy.
There's 42 asset markets in this particular table,
things like the S&P, Shanghai Composite,
then we move on to the volatility,
like the CVIX, the move index,
move on to the commodities markets,
we move on to the currency markets,
and then we move on to US and global interest rates,
credit spreads, et cetera.
And what we're trying to do in this system
is effectively knock on the door
of every single major asset market in the world,
vis-a-vis through the lens of our volatility
adjusted momentum signal,
and ask them, okay, what are you pricing in?
What are you trying to price in?
So for example, let's look at the S&P.
The S&P is currently bullish.
Well, historically the S&P has been bullish in Goldilocks
and bullish in reflation based on our back testing.
It has not been bullish in inflation and deflation,
so those are getting zero points,
whereas Goldilocks and reflation
are currently getting one point apiece from the S&P.
We run that same process across the entire table
on a daily basis,
and ultimately what we're trying to do
is ascertain which of these grid regimes
is actually getting the most love
from financial markets at any given time.
And right now, Goldilocks, or not right now,
it's been about five weeks now,
where Goldilocks has been the dominant regime.
29 of those 42 markets are confirming Goldilocks,
and that's the highest share of the total.
You can see Goldilocks is the highest line on this chart
in terms of the share.
And so this process is sort of step one
in terms of how to help investors,
how we help investors orient their portfolio,
orient their incremental decision-making.
You always wanna be doing
what the market is telling you to do,
particularly when it does something new,
as it did kind of in mid-November
when it pivoted to Goldilocks.
We then layer on this macro weather model
to give us a sense whether or not
the regime that the markets are currently pricing in
is likely to persist.
And as you can see, stock market up, bond market up,
Bitcoin up, dollar down, commodities neutral.
Yeah, Goldilocks should persist.
And it's persisting for fundamental reasons.
If you look at it, the fundamental regime,
if you look at where the direction of growth
and the direction of inflation are telling you,
it's telling you that the economy
is currently in Goldilocks,
the markets are currently in Goldilocks,
and then all of these, the various principal components
of macro that have historically been proven
to create dispersion within and across asset markets
are telling you that Goldilocks-type market conditions
should persist throughout this asset class
over the next three months.
So to us, investing is not about having
some 12-month outlook,
particularly when I'm talking to our buy-side clients
who have to generate P&L on a daily basis,
but pretty much to stay in their seats these days.
It's not about, okay, on December 31st, 2024,
I think, therefore.
To me, it's about having a rolling Bayesian process
that allows you to consistently make money
and/or save money by being out of the wrong assets
at the right time.
And so to me, I think we have,
we do things very differently at 42 Macro,
and that's the reason why we started this presentation
with saying, of all the people you interviewed this year,
we had the most success.
And the reason we had the most success
is because we have a Bayesian quantitative research
and risk management process.
- Well, and you know, as you talked about that,
you talked about how, you know, you're data-driven
in a way that hopefully avoids confirmation bias,
where you're just literally doing
what the data is telling you to do.
And, you know, we've talked a lot recently on this channel
about the perception traps that a lot of investors
get caught in for understandable reasons.
So for example, you know, if you look at a lot of metrics,
stocks are still really richly valued, right,
by historical ratios.
But to your point,
you're just basically trading the market we have
versus the market that, you know, you think we should have.
Right? - Yeah.
- And just because stocks are richly valued
does not mean they can't get more richly valued
over the next three months or six months or whatever,
depending upon what happened.
I mean, the longer we stay in Goldilocks, theoretically,
you know, it can keep going up
for as long as we stay in it, right?
And so it's, I think it's just very important to have
analysts and frameworks out there like yours
that are so obviously so data dependent
that it's clearly not an argument of opinions.
It's just saying, hey, you know,
this is what the model is saying.
Now let's talk about whether we agree
with what it's saying or not.
But, you know, we're letting the data
do a lot of our opinionating for us.
- 100%, man, I appreciate you saying that
because at the end of the day,
you have a choice to make as an investor.
Are you the kind of investor that creates a thesis
and then positions for the thesis
and then subjects yourself to the, you know,
the obviously forecast there that many investors
have experienced, you know, over the last few years
to great degrees?
Or are you someone that's more humble
and respecting of market conditions
and respecting of the evolution of economic signals
and that allow you to sort of constantly adjust your,
constantly adjust your portfolio?
You know, I think, you know,
we very much would be in the latter camp.
You know, I'm not saying that,
we obviously think this is a better camp,
but you know, my goal is not to, you know,
force everyone into our side of the boat
'cause quite frankly, we will lose our edge
if everyone started to invest like this.
We are making money on the other side of the trades
that people who formulate these investment theses
and subject themselves to forecast error,
you know, we're on the other side of their trades
and making money because of it,
because we're being more agnostic
and because we're being more humble
and open to the evolution of market signals,
the evolution of the economy.
You asked a great question earlier with respect to,
you know, are you only concerned
about the next three months?
The reality is if you do this on a daily basis,
you never really have, you know,
you're always going to be forward looking
and you're always gonna have an opportunity
to reposition your portfolio
when something material changes in the economy
or in the markets.
And one final thing I'll say, you mentioned valuation.
You know, this is our positioning model.
We're tracking non-commercial length
as a percentage total open interest
across various asset classes.
We're tracking the year over year growth rate of cash,
the AI bulls, AI bears, AI bulls bear spread,
the AI stock allocation, bond allocation cash,
one month in realized vol is a proxy
for systematic investor positioning.
And then we have the market multiple here.
And you mentioned the market multiple,
we're in the 79th percentile of daily data
going back to, I want to say 1990s,
when we started having the price
of the next 12 month earnings data for the S&P.
And we are effectively at a level
that is consistent with major market peaks.
If you look at the major market peaks
that we have in this indicator,
we have data for this indicator for,
on a median basis, it's in the 80th percentile
at the major bull market peaks of the S&P.
However, we're not seeing that signal really confirmed
at, you know, things like, you know, stock allocations.
You're typically in the 82nd percentile.
We're only in the 55th percentile now.
You're typically down in the 33rd percentile on bonds.
We're in the 54th percentile now.
You're typically down in the 24th percentile on cash.
We're in the 37th percentile now.
So this tells you that from a positioning standpoint,
yes, the market is overvalued,
but it can and probably should and will get more overvalued
as investor positioning, you know,
kind of gets forced into this Goldilocks trade,
either by hook or crook.
If we persist in this Goldilocks top-down market regime
that our global macro risk matrix,
you know, called out, you know, a month ago,
if we persist, then this positioning will be forced
to change, at least on the buy side,
'cause we know folks will get, you know,
fired and they'll lose their jobs if they don't.
But even on the retail side, you know,
retail investors like to chase performances,
the number one thing, you can set your watch
to retail investors, chase your watch.
- Well, to your, our analogy earlier, you know,
the party's really got to get raging, right?
And you're saying it's, hey, folks are showing up.
They're having a good time.
But, you know, the cocaine and strippers
haven't come out quite just yet.
- Yeah, absolutely.
And going back to that analogy,
while we're on this particular topic,
I think it's a good segue, if you don't mind,
going back to rising probability of a hard landing
or of a soft landing in the economy,
because, you know, I think it's very important
to acknowledge things have changed, right?
Like when we were last discussing this,
we were saying, hey, look,
if we're going to have a recession,
it's probably going to start in this six month window.
So we need to be very, very, you know,
kind of cognizant of data that might support that.
And we were very much on the lookout.
You know, remember we talked about our 42 macro,
Fab Five recession signaling indicators.
We were talking about our, the Delta and the momentum
in Java's claims as leading indicators
of a near term recession.
And, you know, those things have evolved
in a favorable manner.
But to me, the most important thing that's happened,
you know, since we last spoke,
that has significantly reduced the probability
of a hard landing and significantly increased
the probability of a soft landing,
is the material bounce that we've seen in productivity growth.
You know, I'll just show a quick chart on that
and come back to it because it's kind of the punch,
it's both the opener and the closer.
But we saw productivity growth accelerated to 2.4%
on a year of year basis.
That's about kind of 50 basis points,
give or take above the long-term trend.
The reason that matters is because productivity growth,
the increase in productivity growth does two things.
It reduces the need for corporations to shed costs
and it reduces the need for them to pass on price increases
to customers, which ultimately takes the bed
out of the game, right?
And so if you have, you take the bed out of the game
and it reduces the probability of seeing mass firings
and mass unemployment.
So in this particular chart here, Adam,
we show our corporate profits model,
that's the shaded area curve,
that's nominal gross domestic income growth,
minus the spread between the growth rate
of unit labor costs and productivity.
And what we call it out, you know,
in terms of getting Q3 GDP report, going back to,
I want to say at the end of October was the first one,
we were noticing, hey,
this is the second consecutive quarter
where our corporate profitability model
is actually improving.
- Right, and we didn't have this
when you and I talked last.
It looked like hitting down to the zero bound, yeah.
- Yeah, we were at the cyclical lows.
Not only did the data point improve,
it actually was revised higher.
So, you know, we were at the cyclical low saying,
hey, look, you know, we are kind of getting to a threshold
where if you go back and look at the, you know,
all the recessions in this chart occur
when you have a negative value in this indicator,
we were getting close to that negative value.
So we should have been on high alert and on edge for,
you know, the probability of a reasonably decent probability
of a hard landing.
We never got that.
- So what's driving that?
Is it inflation coming down as aggressively as it has?
I saw one of the slides here said AI to the rescue.
Could it be AI that,
could we be seeing those kinds of results this early
or what's driving this?
- No, so we, as economists,
I'll put my economist hat on too.
I barely wear the economist hat.
I didn't wear the investor hat,
but putting my economist hat on,
we have no idea what causes productivity growth.
You know, we have seen, you know,
every major statistical study
in terms of white papers and whatnot
and the reality is, you know,
there's two things that economists,
if they were being honest,
will tell you that we know nothing about forecasting,
which is productivity growth
and really what causes inflation.
We have theories on what causes productivity growth
and what causes inflation.
Obviously, capital deepening, capital investment
have historically led, you know,
booms in productivity as we saw kind of in the mid nineties.
And that's maybe something that we could potentially be
on the precipice of here if AI is as big
as some investors think it might be.
So that's kind of the one thing I'll say is,
but to me, it's not about saying, you know,
what's causing it.
To me, the real question is, you know,
what do I do about it?
- Right, it's rising, so what do I do, yeah.
- Exactly, exactly.
So let's go back to this chart
and kind of there's a series of charts
that I think are very important to kind of hammer home
to help investors understand how the world has changed.
And if they are not accepting that the world has changed,
they will continue to lose money
on the other side of our trades.
And so this is, this again,
as our corporate profitability model would improve
for second consecutive quarter.
It's effectively signaling
that we're gonna avoid a deep earnings recession.
If you look at the black dotted lines in this chart,
where we show our corporate profitability model
in the top panel, we show corporate profits year over year,
nipple corporate profits year over year in the second panel,
we show nominal S&P earnings on a trailing 12 month basis
in the third panel, and we show the drawdown
in S&P earnings in the fourth panel.
As you can see in the black dotted lines here
that they all correspond to the bottom
in our corporate profitability metric.
And as you can see, almost always they lead
a significant drawdown in S&P earnings.
And now that our corporate profitability model
is actually improving, we can say that we're probably going
to avoid a deep earnings recession.
And that's positive at the margin
because ultimately what it means is that corporate profits
are not gonna draw down materially enough
to perpetuate mass firing and unemployment, right?
If you look at this, this is a nipple corporate profits
on a raw basis, and we show that on a drawdown basis
here in the bottom panel.
And with this red dotted line indicates
is that it's the median value of the drawdowns
that we typically observe at the start of recession.
And so we know corporate profits where they're down about,
let's call it seven and a half, 8% on a peak to trough basis
that's when recession start, that's when corporations say,
man, I gotta do something different.
I gotta start firing people.
I gotta start cutting costs.
And that becomes a reflexive process
of declining employment, declining income,
declining investment and declining consumption,
which is obviously what a recession actually is.
So we avoided that outcome, we avoided that fate.
Corporate profitability model saying that that fate
is kind of in the rear view mirror, at least for now.
One final, two final things I'll make
on this particular chart, it's pretty easy chart
to explain the blue line just shows wage growth,
private sector average hourly earnings growth
minus the growth rate of non-farm productivity.
And the reason that that spread matters
is because when you have a big spike in the spread
between wage growth and non-farm productivity,
you typically have a big spike in inflation.
That's exactly what we saw throughout the sixties and seventies.
That's exactly what we saw here
in the kind of the post COVID world.
And so, although I guess maybe not post COVID for you,
but this is what we're saying.
- Good one, that was a good one.
- But one thing I'll say is that we are now back
at a more normalized level in terms of the spread
between wage growth and productivity,
which should tell you that inflation and a lag,
given some of the lagging statistics
within the inflation data,
inflation and a lag should return to a more normalized level
over the medium term as well.
And then the final chart I'll share on this,
and then I'll shut up and let you get back
to asking questions is, you know,
if you're gonna have a soft landing in the economy,
soft landings are rare, right?
If you go back and look at the last nine tightening cycles,
which is all we have data for
in terms of the fed funds rate,
we've only had two soft landings.
We had two soft lands with the green dotted lines
in this chart indicate that's one here in the mid eighties.
We had another soft landing in mid nineties,
but every other time the fed has hiked the policy rate,
you know, underwent a tightening cycle,
we ultimately wound up in a recession within, you know,
kind of 18 to 24 months at the longest.
So how do you create a soft landing?
Well, one, you need, you know,
trend levels of productivity growth at minimum.
Right now, we're currently slightly above trend,
but you certainly need a decent,
a decent productivity growth environment,
but you also need the fed to acknowledge that, you know,
the policy is probably a little too tight
and they need to pivot.
And that's exactly what we saw on the mid eighties
in the mid nineties in terms of the fed, you know,
starting to implement rate cuts
in those particular outcomes.
And then we also saw,
in terms of what you need to create a soft landing,
we also saw above trend growth
in government consumption and investment.
This is on a year over year basis here in this bottom panel.
And as you can see,
the light blue line just shows the long-term average
of this year over year rate of change.
And as you can see, persistently for years,
a post this mid eighties tightening cycle,
we had above trend growth in government,
you know, purchases and investments.
So the fiscal impulse was quite positive
in terms of perpetuating growth back then.
And then back in the mid nineties,
in terms of that soft landing,
we had a productivity boom.
And in my opinion,
I think this had a lot to do with the internet,
the deployment, the production, the building,
and the deployment of the internet
in kind of in the mid nineties.
And so this goes back to the point, you know,
if we're gonna have a soft landing here in the US economy,
you're gonna need, you know, some fiscal stimulus.
You're gonna need the Fed to pivot to rate cuts,
check, check in both of those regards.
And then you're gonna need,
you're probably gonna need some improvement in productivity,
particularly off this multi-year base
of negative productivity growth.
And in my opinion, it's already happening.
- And you're seeing those.
Okay, Darius, I've got a ton more macro questions.
I'd love to get your input on,
but I feel like I'm sort of wasting the talent here.
I know everybody wants to know,
okay, this is all great guys,
but what does Darius think
the markets are gonna do from here?
So can I just let you run on your market outlook here?
So you're bullish for the next three months,
perhaps as bullish as you can possibly be,
if I wrote down that quote correctly.
Is it a hooray for everything?
Stocks, bonds, you know, I saw commodities
were yellow line, yellow light on your dashboard there.
How are you thinking of playing this?
- Yeah, so as you mentioned,
or I think we mentioned this last time.
So we run a systematic portfolio construction process
for our clients at 42 Macro
called our KISS portfolio construction process.
It's KISS, short for keep it simple and systematic.
And how that process works is we layer on our bottom-up
and our top-down risk management overlay.
Our top-down risk management overlay
comes from that weather model signal.
It's guiding the target allocations
per asset class for each of the asset classes
in the 60/30/10 trend following strategy.
And then we layer on our bottom-up risk management overlay,
which is our volatility adjustment momentum signal,
which determines our actual exposure
in the 60/30/10 strategy.
And so, you know, kind of just giving you a look
at where we are currently, we are max invested
and we have been max invested for about a month now.
If you look at, you know, we're at 0% cash,
we're at 100% of our max exposure of 60% in stocks.
That's, we just use the SPY for that.
We also, you know, create tools that allow our clients
to kind of create a customized version of this,
but we default to stocks as SPY.
We default to ag for fixed income.
We're at 100% of our max exposure of fixed income.
And then we default to Bitto
until we get ATF approved for Bitcoin.
And so we're at 100% of our max exposure there.
So as I mentioned, the target exposure for the S&P is 60%
because of the stock market signal
and the weather model is bullish.
The target exposure for the bond market is 30%
because the weather model signal
for the bond market is bullish.
And the target exposure for Bitcoin is 10%
because the weather model signal for Bitcoin is bullish.
And then each of these ETFs independently
are also signaling bullish
from the perspective of that volatility,
just the momentum signal that we highlighted
in the global macro risk matrix.
And so, you know, if you look at it
from a top-down quantitative signaling process
or from a bottom-up quantitative signaling process,
everything is telling you to be completely max long here.
Now, the system will evolve over time
and tell you to be less max long.
But again, it's not my job to predict the predictors.
My job is to do what the system says.
And the reason I say it,
and the reason that's a good thing is because it works.
This is the out-of-sample backtest,
the performance of this KISS process,
which we've been running since January of this year
on a live basis.
And I use this process to manage all of my liquid net worth.
So it's definitely,
I can confirm that it's definitely working.
- You've got skin in the game on how this model performs.
- Yeah, a hundred percent, man.
Absolutely.
I mean, I think this,
we're gonna run an asset management business someday
on this process.
I can guarantee you that
'cause I don't see too many firms
on the asset management side offering this type of product
to retail investors.
Obviously you can get this
if you're running a hedge fund, family office,
but generally speaking retail and RA investors
don't have the ability to implement strategies like this.
And so this is why we're so proud to present this.
And it's really being weaponized across the world
by thousands of investors
who are taking advantage of these signals.
So going back to just kind of some quick summary statistics
on why this process is so valuable.
If you sort of look at this hypothetical performance
of this process relative to the 60/40 portfolio
or relative to a 60/30/10 portfolio
of those assets on a raw basis
without those top-down and bottom-up risk management overlays
our KISS portfolio construction process
compares very favorably to that.
Right now, KISS has a sharp ratio of 0.9
which compares very favorably to the sharp ratio of 0.5
for both 60/40 and 60/30/10 raw
without those top-down and bottom-up risk management
overlay signals.
The average annual return for KISS is 12.7%
and the max drawdown for KISS is 10.6%
and there's only one double digit drawdown
in the entire back test
which goes from January 1st, 2018.
If you look at that,
that's obviously on an average annual return basis
is much better than the 7.1% return
that you get for the 60/40 portfolio
and you also have to suffer a 22.2% max drawdown
to get that 7.1% return.
And oh, by the way,
there've been three double digit returns
in 60/40 portfolio since then
with two crashes, 22.2% a piece.
And then lastly, if you just sort of ran 60/30/10 stocks,
bonds, crypto, stocks, bonds, Bitcoin
without any of those overlays,
you're gonna have a 12.4% average annual return
but your drawdown, your volatility
is going to be much, much more severe.
You got a max drawdown amount of 25.3%
and by the way, you've crashed if you're 60/30/10 raw
three times in the last six years.
So this is a very powerful process.
It's working.
It's gonna continue to work.
It's not gonna remain fully invested, fully bullish
but the reason I started this conversation
with answering your question,
which is I'm as bullish as I could possibly be
is because this system is telling me to be bullish
as I possibly can be.
And it's being driven
by some very powerful quantitative tools.
- All right.
And do me a favor if we go back to the KISS chart
where you have your allocations.
- Allocation, yep.
- Just for the folks that are listening on a podcast
and don't have this visual in front of them.
I just wanna note that you call this the KISS portfolio
because it is as simple as you can make it.
And for equities, you're using the SPY ETF
for fixed income, you're using AGG
and for Bitcoin you're using BITO.
So I just want folks to be aware of those
if they wanna go research them on their own.
- Yeah, I appreciate you saying that.
Thank you.
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, so look, the whole point of this
was not to sort of create an advertisement for a 4G macro.
What I'm trying to do is help investors understand
that there is a different way to invest.
Like think about it.
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing
over and over again and expecting different results.
Most of the people that I'm talking to right now
that are listening to you, Adam, need guidance
because they lost a bunch of money last year.
And even though the markets have gone really well this year
they didn't make any money.
They didn't make any monies
'cause they're doing the same things over and over again
expecting different results.
And they're not getting different results.
They're getting the same below subpar results
that they've been mired in for quite a while now.
We're just telling you that there's a different way
and thousands of investors all over the world
are appreciating that different way
because it's making the money.
- All right, well, congratulations so far on these results.
So I was gonna ask you about stocks and bonds.
You've kind of answered my bonds question here
which is that you were very bullish on them too.
You've got the max allocation of them.
I hate to go back to some of these macro questions
because I appreciate the fact
that a large part of what you're saying is,
yes, we take the macro into consideration
but we're really just looking at what the markets are doing
because that is telling us where they're most likely to head.
- Can I correct you a little bit there?
- Please do.
- Absolutely, yeah.
So I would characterize it a little bit differently.
We are orienting our investment decision-making process
around what the markets are doing,
what the markets are pricing in from a regime standpoint.
If the markets are trying to price in Goldilocks,
we should be trying to price in Goldilocks
in terms of the positions that we have in our portfolio.
We then supplement that global macro risk matrix signal,
that regime signal with the weather model
and then with our qualitative research
like we were just talking about with productivity.
And it's one thing to say, okay, today I'm fully invested
because KISS tells me to be fully invested
where Goldilocks top-down market regime,
the weather model signals are telling me
that it's a clear blue sky for the next three months.
But we also need to do that qualitative research
so that when I'm talking to institutional investors
or skeptical retail investors
about the persistency of the current regime,
then I can say, hey, yeah,
well these are all the things
that are happening fundamentally
that might make this thing persist, right?
That's why I do fundamental research.
I don't do fundamental research to say
the economy is gonna do X,
therefore I'm gonna position Y.
- Right.
- That's why we do fundamental research.
I do fundamental research
and we do fundamental research here at 42 Macro
to determine how long is this regime
that we're positioned for going to persist
and what's gonna cause it to change in the future
that we can kind of prepare ourselves for.
- Okay, great.
I really appreciate you elaborating on that
and it makes a ton of sense.
So let's tread in that world for a little bit.
So stocks and bonds have moved pretty far, pretty fast.
Do you have a concern that they could be getting so frothy
that they're pulling in a lot of their future gains?
And so maybe your weather report has said to date,
hey, next three months look good,
but if they keep kind of running up,
does that maybe potentially pull in the date
at which some sort of reversal is gonna have to happen
just because they're getting too overvalued?
I'm guessing you would say,
I've got enough indicators in there
to show me when the cocaine and the strippers show up.
And so I'm gonna sort of see some of those warning signs,
but I gotta imagine some of your macro research
is taking that into consideration.
Also in your answer too,
if you can talk about how you think of something
like interest rates, right?
So Powell just sort of surprised the markets.
One of the reasons why the markets are performing
as well as they are here in the short term
is because they feel like they just got a green light
from Powell to go party on.
And if Powell is indeed going to be more dovish
going forward, does that change inflation expectations?
And if so, does that potentially change any of your timing
of some of these regimes that you're looking at?
- 100%, that's exactly, we'll unpack that as well.
So I'll answer your question.
So to me, like the number one risk in the market,
obviously given that the market is effectively pricing
in a soft rising and reasonably high probability
of a soft landing, the risk economically
that could cause the market to start pricing
in something else from a regime standpoint
is a rising probability of a hard or no landing.
And so we'll unpack both of those in succession,
but let's start this conversation with interest rates.
And so what I'm showing in this chart here
are the policy rates.
That's the shaded area curve in this chart.
This is Fed, ECB, Bank of England, Bank of Japan.
And the blue line in each of these panels
is the three month overnight index swap rate.
So that's a swap on the policy rate itself.
And so, and what that swap rate over that particular tenor
is pricing in relative to the policy rate.
So the three month is the blue line.
The red line is the six month.
The purple line is the nine month
and the green line is the one year.
And as you can see on a one year basis,
overnight index swaps are pricing in,
170, let's call it seven rate cuts by the Fed.
That's very unlikely to happen in my opinion, right?
To me, this is a very aggressive starting point
from the perspective of,
where do asset markets go from here?
Because ultimately it means
that we're probably very fully priced
in terms of this kind of perfect soft landing scenario
with respect to the money markets.
That obviously will influence the bond markets
and will influence longer term interest rates,
which ultimately influence stock market valuations.
The one thing I'll say as an investor,
you need to be very careful
of sort of anchoring your entire investment process
or entire portfolio on one dynamic.
Because as we show with the weather model,
each of those dynamics have been proven to create,
dispersion within and across asset markets.
This is something we've back-tested in the weather model.
These are all the weather model component signals.
And we know that each one of these things at any given time
is actually contributing to the outlook for asset markets.
We are guilty, you, me, everyone on finance, Twitter,
everyone on these podcasts are guilty
of only talking about one, two,
maybe even three things at a time.
But in reality is markets are way more complex,
they're way more dynamic.
And our tiny little human brains will allow us to understand.
And so that's one thing I'll say.
So let's talk about the hard landing
and then we'll talk about the no landing
in terms of things that could potentially change the market.
So in terms of the market regime.
So we'll start here, I think you and I talked about this
in terms of the yield curve last time we spoke,
but we're still very deeply inverted
in the three month, 10 year treasury yield curve.
And this thing has the best back test
of predicting a recession of anything in the economy.
It's eight for the last nine.
The only time that's what these black dotted lines indicate
is the date of the initial version of the yield curve.
And ultimately each one of the last eight
have led a recession.
The only one that did not lead a recession
in the history of this time series is the mid 1960s.
And so, you gotta go back to the mid 1960s.
If this is not gonna create a recession,
you gotta say, okay, we have to have conditions
that are similar to the mid 1960s,
which from a private sector balance sheet perspective,
we actually do.
That's a loaded statement.
So I'm gonna pause that for now
and just get back to the hard landing probability.
So as we talked about last time,
the window of time that has the highest probability
of seeing a recession start,
if we were going to have a recession,
is this November, 2023 to April, 2024 time period.
And how we ascertain that as we went back and we back tested
the evolution of the economy through various metrics
from the date of those yield curve inversions.
And what we found is the 13, 18 month forward interval
for both real GDP in terms of seeing real GDP contraction
and has the highest probability
of seeing real GDP contraction.
And the 13, 18 month forward interval
has the highest probability
of seeing a rise in unemployment rate as well.
So that's where we're getting that window of weakness here.
We are in that window of weakness right now,
so we need to be very on high alert
for seeing a recession commence.
One thing that's given me confidence
that we're probably not gonna see a hard landing
is some of the fiscal policy dynamics.
We are seeing less fiscal support for the economy,
but it's not falling off a cliff.
You would need to see it fall off a cliff
to see sharp deceleration and growth
that could obviously lead to a big contraction
in labor market conditions.
And so what we're showing here is our fiscal policy monitor.
We're looking at federal revenue, federal expenditures,
and ultimately the federal budget balance
through the lens of the nominal year to date sum
for each of these line items.
We look at the share of the total by category.
We look at the year over year change by category.
And then we show the trailing 10 year Z score
that year over year rate of change
to give you a sense of how, if it's sharper
or not so much.
So a couple of things I highlight here.
If you look at the year over year nominal delta
of the federal budget deficit,
it's about $320 billion higher
than it was on a year to date basis
through November of last year.
So that's actually quite positive.
It's less positive than it was in June.
We were up $834 billion on a year over year basis,
but again, plus $320 billion is quite favorable.
We have a cost of living increase of 8.7% here in 2023.
It's only gonna be about 3.2% in 2024.
So we know we're gonna see things like Medicare,
which is 14% of the budget growing 19% year over year
or social security, which is 22% of the budget
growing 12% year over year.
We're gonna see that growth slow, but in our opinion,
and again, this is a qualitative research opinion.
It's very unlikely we see those things slow sharply enough
in a presidential election year
with an incumbent Democrat president
who was more inclined to spin than obviously
than many other presidents in history.
So in our opinion, we are having fiscal retrenchment,
but it's not the kind of fiscal retrenchment
that should cause the economy to fall off a cliff.
One final thing I'll say,
or sorry, just shifting gears a little bit
to the no landing scenario,
'cause I think equally the two biggest market risks
are hard landing and no landing
because soft landing has become so aggressively priced
in the markets.
That doesn't mean it can't continue to be priced,
but it's probably not willing to be priced
to the same degree and expediency that we observed
in the last, let's call it six weeks.
It's just very unlikely, right?
The markets don't annualize hundreds of percent at a time.
It'll slow down, but slowing down is very different
than okay, going from a Goldilocks regime
to a risk off inflation or a risk off deflation regime.
Inflation, risk off inflation regime
would be the no landing scenario.
A risk off deflation regime
would be the hard landing scenario.
So we talked about the hard landing scenario.
So we need to be very alert for signs of recession
over the next few months.
Given that window of weakness that we're in.
But again, we continue to believe
that the probability of recession has gone down
thanks largely to those improving productivity
and profitability dynamics in the corporate sector.
Getting back to the no landing scenario,
we talked about this chart last time you and I spoke, Adam,
which is a very important chart
for understanding the business cycle in and around recession.
So on this chart, I'm showing the median trailing 10 year
Delta adjusted Z score of a basket of indicators
for each of these cycles, housing, orders,
production and profits, employment, inflation.
So I'm showing the median Z score
of all the different time series
that feed into each of these cycles.
There's about, let's call it five to 12 indicators per cycle
and all the Delta adjusted means, by the way,
it's just that up is good and down is bad.
So you had to invert things like jobless claims
and the unemployed.
And so what we know is that the housing cycle
tends to break down about 16, 18 months ahead of recession.
The order cycle tends to break down
about eight to 10 months ahead of recession.
Production profits tends to break down
about four to six months ahead of recession.
The employment cycle tends to break down
right on time when the recession starts.
But the most important thing that I want to flag here
is in this chart, is the inflation cycle,
things like wages, core PCE, headline, CPI,
all that kind of stuff that we track.
Those things on a median basis tend to break down
six to eight months after recession starts.
And so what that tells me is that
we are experiencing immaculate disinflation.
We can see it in the data.
I'll just show you a quick chart on that
before we get back to this discussion.
We are experiencing immaculate disinflation.
This is the core PCE deflator shown
on a three month annualized rate of change basis.
That's the blue bars there.
The six month annualized is the black line
and the year over year is the red line.
And what we're seeing is that we're basically back
to 2% inflation on both a three month annualized
and a six month annualized,
which means the year over year is going to be dragged lower
in the months ahead.
So in our opinion, that disinflation process,
which has allowed the Fed to kind of take a victory lap
a few weeks ago, is ultimately what's contributing
to that easing, the dovish pricing
that we're seeing in money markets.
So to me, I think we also have to be on high alert
as investors for signs that, hey, inflation story
might not be as supportive and dovish as we think.
And two things I'll throw at you before I shut up
is this evolution of super core CPI.
You look at super core CPI on a three month annualized basis,
we are now tracking at 5.1% three month annualized.
That number's accelerated for one, two, three, four,
five months in a row, and it's still well above trend.
And if you look at something like median CPI,
that number's accelerated four months in a row
to 4.9% three month annualized.
That number's also well above trends.
So there are emergent signs of sticky inflation
in the economy, and those emergent signs,
if they start to materialize into more broad based signs
of a sticky inflation in the US economy,
then we will see an end to that Goldilocks regime.
We will see what the signals in the weather model evolve
in a way that starts to force our kids'
portfolio construction process to take down risk.
And ultimately we do believe that is something
that could very well happen, but it isn't happening now.
And I think we'd be fools to just jump in the kiddie pool
with everybody else and trying to predict
when those things are going to happen
and telling the economy and telling markets
what they need to do, as opposed to just being humble
and being Bayesian and monitoring this stuff daily
to spot the critical inflections in real time.
We think we figured out a better mousetrap for that.
- Got it, got it.
And I love your mousetrap, Darius,
that hasn't been abundantly clear
from your previous appearances here, huge fan of it.
So let me ask you a couple of questions
as we start to wrap up here.
The data suggests that we are in immaculate
disinflation, as you said, and you had brought that term up
the last time that we talked as a potential.
If indeed that's what plays out here,
does Powell like deserve a medal?
- I've been saying that the whole time.
I think he deserves an absolute A plus.
By the way, he nailed this, Adam.
At the beginning of the tightening cycle in March of 2022,
he said, quote, or I don't wanna, sorry,
I'm not gonna say quote, but air quotes.
He said effectively something to the tune of,
hey, I think we can create some slack in the labor market
by reducing job openings and not have, you know,
this kind of negative outcome and a hard landing.
And that's exactly what we're seeing.
If you go and you look at what's actually happening
in the labor market, it's also been immaculate
in terms of the slack that we've created.
So this is an important chart as well.
One of the more important charts in macro right now,
where we show the size of the labor force,
we show a nominal gross domestic income.
We see that nominal gross domestic income
long ago eclipsed its long-term trend,
but we have yet to eclipse the long-term trend
in the size of the labor force,
which means there's a lot of cash in the economy, you know,
but there's not a lot of people in the economy
to create goods and services, you know,
for that cash to be soaked up into.
This panel here, we show labor demand
relative to labor supply.
Labor demand is just total household survey employment
plus total job openings.
And that number is growing about, or sorry,
that number is about 2.4 million a surplus
in favor of labor demand.
And so that number peaked at about plus 6 million
in early 2022.
And the reason it's gone down from plus 6 million
to plus 2 million over the past couple of years
is this immaculate labor market slackening process
that Powell called out in March of 2022.
He said, and it's exactly what's happening since then,
is the red line has gone down.
Jolt's total job openings has gone down
for almost two years now,
but the total employment has continued to rise.
We have never seen a divergence like this
in the history of these time series.
And so Powell, going back to answer your question,
he does deserve a medal
if he soft lands this plane in the Hudson, you know,
because again, this is exactly what he called for.
We're seeing it in the data.
And ultimately, if we soft land this economy,
there's a lot of folks in the no landing camp,
and there's a lot of folks in the hard landing camp
that got to chase this market higher in 2022.
- And that makes a lot of sense
for your continued bullishness, right?
That if those folks just have to get up
and get into the pool,
because that's where the growth is, the gains are.
All right, so many other questions.
- No time, man.
- Well, I want to be conscientious of your time
and respectful of it,
but two last questions and I'll wrap it up.
And I'll take a short answer on this one
'cause it's a very long discussion.
We don't have time to do it full justice,
but a lot of people, and myself included,
I want to be super transparent about that,
have been, you know, for a long time,
urging caution about the lag effect.
Don't assume that it's not going to express itself
just because it hasn't expressed itself yet.
We, to a certain extent,
at least I'll say from my expectations,
haven't seen the type of lag effect
that I would have expected from such aggressive increase
in the cost of capital.
And maybe what has cushioned that
has been the net positive liquidity,
and that's been a really big factor in this.
But I'm curious, do you expect,
which is what's your opinion on the lag effect?
Is it something to be concerned about
or are you not that worried about it?
- Well, I mean, I think that the only lag effect
that we need to be concerned about right now
is the easing that we're going to see
and the easing that was going to flow through the economy
as a function of the financialization of the economy.
You know, don't forget that only 33% of bank credit
in the U.S., the private non-financial sector credit
in the U.S. economy is on bank balance sheet.
Only 32% of that.
That means the other 67% is in the buy side,
in the private sector.
It's an insurance fund, on pension funds,
it's on mutual funds, you know, that money.
So when we see money market rates decline
to the way they do in price and rate cuts,
and we see bond yields go down the rate they do,
we see bond market volatility go down,
currency market volatility go down, the dollar go down,
all those things are supporting
the credit intermediation functions
of these non-bank market participants.
And so, you know, in terms of the lag effect,
to me, the lag effect that we need to be most concerned
about as investors right now is seeing very positive
outcomes from the economic standpoint in, you know,
one, two, three, four quarters,
because of all the monetary easing
that's been priced into markets.
Again, we're so focused on the fed funds rate, not we,
but the average investor is extremely focused
on the fed funds rate,
but the inmates have been running the asylum for years now.
You know, what's priced into asset markets
are the fluctuations in where the fed funds rate
forward curve is.
And the fed funds rate forward curve is already priced,
you know, a major monetary easing cycle.
And so that is already being flowed into, you know,
corporate credit spreads and corporate yields
and things of that nature and making it a lot easier
for borrowers on both the household and corporate sector
to roll over existing debt and to require a new credit.
So in my opinion, I think, yeah, the lags matter,
but you gotta be thinking about this in terms of upside risks
to the economy, given the evolution of markets.
- Meaning that the lag effect that was priced
into the market may now need to substantially come out of it
because of these factors.
- Oh yeah, I wouldn't say it necessarily like that,
but saying we saw the slowdown, you know,
in terms of the lag effects from, you know,
let's call it the early 2021 through all the way through
kind of the late Q4 or early Q1 of this year.
That lag effect, you know, we saw regional banks blow up.
We saw all those kinds of things
and growth was much slower back then.
In our opinion, a lot of the tightening that we've observed,
you know, was part of, was in that window.
And, you know, it's not to say
that all of the tightening we observed was in that window,
but a lot of it occurred in that window.
And now what we're trying to say is that
because rates have come down,
because volatility has come down,
credit spreads have come in, you know,
coupons payments have come in in terms of, you know,
the yields on these credit instruments.
You know, the lag effect, in my opinion,
is where will the economy be, you know, a year from now?
And if you roll forward the current constellation
of market signals right now,
you're saying that the economy
is probably gonna be doing a lot better a year from now
than I think a lot of investors realize.
- Okay, and one of the things that I'm thinking of
when I talk about the lag effect is the debt maturity wall.
And, you know, even with, even if you take the Fed
at its projected three interest rates cuts this year,
you know, if you're a company and your debt's rolling over
at the end of 2024, you're still gonna be borrowing it,
probably 2X what you were before.
- 100%.
So I just don't see how we escape that.
Now, maybe what I, and this is why I sort of said
what I said earlier, is maybe you would say,
well, the market was pricing it, rolling at a higher rate,
and now the market's gotta price it,
rolling at a lower rate,
and that is actually gonna be maybe net positive.
- 100%, yeah, exactly.
I mean, if credit spreads have come in,
you know, 50 to 100 basis points,
that's 50 to 100 basis points of easing monetary conditions
that allows these, you know, corporations and/or households
to roll over that debt.
It's only a maturity wall if it's hard to refinance.
If it's easy to refinance
because the market is inviting you to refinance
by being credit spreads and rising equity prices,
then it's not a maturity wall, it's just business as usual.
- Got it, got it, okay.
So last macro question and then we'll wrap up.
So it sounds like you think, hey, in the short term,
things are gonna be good.
Things look like they're gonna be really good, right?
Party on everybody and let's go make some money.
Let me ask you a really long-term question,
which is so much of what's going on right now
is driven both by the fiscal impulse and by, you know,
some monetary monkeying around as well, you know,
that is continuing to give one might say
an artificial tailwind to things here.
Is that good?
I mean, does that, can that happen forever
or does this put us on a path to, you know,
currency devaluation, deformed markets,
accelerating wealth, inequality, all that stuff, right?
Like I understand why it helps markets
in the next three months
and maybe might help markets for the next three years.
But as we look out more broadly than that,
is this stuff that's actually more pernicious
than beneficial in the long run?
- I don't know the answer to that question, Adam.
And then, you know, quite frankly,
I'm not sure that I'm equipped to answer it
or even in a position to answer it.
And the reason why is because I don't know
if I had an accurate answer
or an inaccurate answer to that question,
whether it's gonna help me make money
or save money in financial markets either way.
Like we don't need to answer that question
to make and save money in financial markets.
- Absolutely get that, absolutely.
- The only job here in terms of educating our client base
and meeting with institutional investors around the world,
it's to help them make money
and save money in financial markets.
We can have political discussions
and theoretical and philosophical discussions off camera
and over drinks.
When I put this tie on,
it's about making and saving money in financial markets.
And right now our systems are saying,
it's a great time to make money in financial markets.
Eventually our systems will say,
it won't be a great time to make money in financial markets.
And we'll call that out in real time for our subscribers
in terms of portfolio pivots,
flagging the inflections in the mismanagement systems,
flagging the data in the economy
that is either leading or being coincident
with those inflections in the risk management systems
and ultimately helping investors understand
that the distribution of probable economic outcomes
is evolving from what it currently is,
which is coalescing around the soft landing.
Again, it's not about,
if we know that, let's have a hypothetical example, Adam.
Let's say we are going to have a no landing
or a hard landing at some point in 2024.
Why do you need to put that trade on today, December 21st?
Why not put the trade on when the markets are saying,
hey, we're starting to price in something different
than soft landing, than Brody.
- And if you put the trade on today,
you could very well get killed before you're right on it.
I've seen a lot of people do that.
- That's exactly what most people have done
throughout 2023, right?
Like, if I can just summarize our entire process,
it really is, we'd rather be trend followers
than bottom and top pickers.
Most investors want to be bottom and top pickers
and this is why they do research and they put on trades
that are counter to the market momentum.
But the reality is the most powerful force
in both the markets and the economy is momentum.
So your investment process should be oriented
around taking advantage of trends in momentum
as opposed to constantly trying to pick tops and bottoms
which don't occur very often, right?
Like you should be doing, orienting yourself
to things that occur on a higher frequency basis
that allow you to make and save money in financial markets.
So again, we do things differently.
We're proud of doing things differently
because our results are different and they're better.
- All right, great answer.
I kind of liken it to saying to your surgeon,
hey, you know what?
Honestly, I don't really care about your thoughts
about the future of the healthcare industry.
I just want my procedure to go well.
Just focus on my procedure.
- Exactly, exactly.
- All right, super well.
Well, look, for folks that really have enjoyed
this conversation or impressed by your Bayesian approach
here would like to benefit from it,
where can they go to follow you in your work?
- I appreciate that, Adam.
Thank you again for having me, man.
I love these conversations.
You're as good as they come when it comes to
kind of asking all the right questions
and then helping your subscribers and your followers
really kind of do better in terms of their portfolio.
So we are helping folks do a lot better
in their portfolios at 42 Macro.
Come check us out, 42macro.com.
One of the things I think that's differentiated
about our business is that we sell the exact same research
to institutional investors that we sell to retail
and RA investors.
We create a lot of education, educational content,
both behind and beyond our paywall
to help bring all the investors in our community
up to that institutional knowledge base
so that they can take advantage of weaponizing
what we think are some fairly simple but elegant systems
in terms of risk management.
So definitely come check us out, 42macro.com.
I'm on Twitter, DariusDale42.
We put out a lot of content on our YouTube channel as well,
42 Macro, so definitely check us out there as well.
So, you know, like I said, man,
this wasn't intended to be an advertisement of 42 Macro.
I could care less if we get one or zero new subscribers
from this discussion.
I'm just glad to have this discussion openly and honestly,
because I'm proud of what we built at 42 Macro
because it's working for thousands of investors
across the world.
And that's really humbling and it's quite a blessing.
- As I think you should be.
And congratulations again on the success,
the demonstrated success of what you've done there.
I care that if you're a good fit for people,
that they find their way to you.
So when I edit this video, Darius,
I will put the URLs up on the screen
so folks know where to go and folks,
I'll put links in the description of the video too.
So you'll have one click access to all those things.
And Darius, I think we talked about this last time,
but I really appreciate the mission of 42 Macro.
I think you and Thoughtful Money
have very complimentary approaches
where we're all about trying to
address the information asymmetry
and the institutional investor
and the regular retail investor.
And so anyways, I just want to again,
publicly call you out for your efforts to do that.
- Information asymmetry is spot on.
That's all we're trying to do at 42 Macro is,
hey, Mr. U is institutional investor
that I've known for 15 years in global Wall Street.
We're going to continue to support all the things
that help you make and save money
and keep your seat on the buy side.
But I also want to compress that informational asymmetry
and compress that knowledge gap
to our retail and investor clients
so that can bring them up to speed
so that they too can benefit from all these signals.
'Cause at the end of the day,
the goal is to make and save money in financial markets.
If we're doing anything other than that,
then we're wasting time.
- All right, I've got one last question for you
that I've been asking a lot of the people
who come on the program recently.
I forgot to mention this to you before we turn the camera on.
So sorry to surprise you with it.
We've been talking about making money.
We've been talking about helping people
build their financial wealth.
What is one non-money related investment
that you would encourage folks to invest in?
And I'm going to give you about 30 seconds
to think of that
while I do a little bit of housekeeping here.

There's a ton of information I give away for free there,
but I also give away those notes to the premium subscribers
for a very low amount.
All right, Darius, we're back at you here.
Some sort of non-monetary,
just, hey, we always spend a lot of time
thinking about money,
but it's not the only part of wealth.
What's something you'd consider somebody
think of adopting in their life to be,
to live a richer life?
- Yeah, a hundred percent.
That's a great question, Adam.
And my answer is investing in the people in your community.
I think one of the things that,
we're all guilty of being too busy these days.
There's all, there's just information deluge.
We're all working more in longer hours than we used to
on this kind of post-pandemic Zoom world,
where it's a lot easier just to get to your computer
and keep working and crank late at night.
But to me, I think, and this is something I find
in my own personal life,
when I make time to connect with high school kids
or college kids, or to mentor and actually really be,
get my roll up my sleeves and get my hands dirty,
my whole entire life and world perspective changes.
It's not about me, it's not about Darius.
It's about helping these kids achieve better outcomes
than they otherwise would without this kind of coaching
and this kind of mentorship.
And it really helps me because it puts my life
in perspective and ultimately helps me
be more focused at work, be more focused as an investor.
So, kind of the short answer to your question is just,
get out there and make a difference in the world
and be kind and really contribute to your community.
Because at the end of the day,
that is the wealth that we all wanna appreciate.
- That's a great answer.
And I'm actually gonna spend just an extra minute
on this folks.
So bear with us here,
'cause I think that is such a great answer.
Humans are social creatures.
It's just how we evolved.
And we get a huge part of our nourishment in life
from interpersonal relationships.
Which is so interesting because sort of the markers
for success in life these days are sort of the ability
to show that you don't need other people,
that you can live in the big house alone
on the top of the hill, right?
And that social media, despite being named social media
has actually made us feel a lot more disconnected
from other people, which is why obviously
we're seeing such huge rates and unhappiness
and depression and anxiety and all that stuff.
And I think a lot of that has to do to the loss
of these social connections that we're used to having.
'Cause again, that's how we evolved.
I used to at the prior company, we used to do conferences
and we would talk about wealth.
And we had this framework called the eight forms of capital
and financial capital was one of them.
And it's very important, but it was just one of the eight.
And we would ask people to rank themselves
in terms of how wealthy they felt
in each one of those forms of capital.
And the one they would always rate themselves the lowest
and was social capital.
Which was basically having people in their lives
that they could depend on or having enriching relationships
or a feeling of connectedness with their communities
or whatnot.
It's just a chronic deficiency that I would say
more Americans or more people probably sadly
have the not right now.
So I would say we sort of have an epidemic
of a loss of connection.
And so stepping into creating those connections
like you're saying, I just, I couldn't agree with more.
And it's funny you say this because literally
right before I hopped on to record this with you,
I was watching a little video clip from Mike Rowe.
I don't know if you know who he is,
but he's a big fan of kind of blue collar jobs.
And he was profiling a restaurant
that solely employs kids from the juvenile prison system.
And it basically gives them an off-ramp from prison
to learn skills, you know, learn job skills.
And it continues a lot of the sort of wraparound services
they have when they're in prison.
'Cause oftentimes you get out of prison,
you have things like, you know, mentors and job people
and mental health specialists and stuff like that.
And then you get out and you're right back on the streets
and you kind of, you know, you're unsupported,
you fall back into your old habits.
So this does a great job of taking, you know,
sort of damaged human capital in a community
and investing in it and rebuilding it
so that it can be productive and live a much better life
and have a much bigger future.
You know, it's just a small example,
but to your point Darius, like,
I think that's where our future lies,
where, you know, we've got to acknowledge that,
you know, first that we have a problem, right?
That we're as disconnected as we are,
but like solutions like that, where we say, okay, you know,
in addition to just policies or cursing the darkness,
like let's light some candles
and actually try to create some sustainable models.
Maybe they need to be economic ones
to make them incent people enough,
but to, you know, make people care
about building more of these connections
because it's a key component of human happiness.
Anyways, I'll get off my soapbox here.
- No, no, I love your soapbox, man.
Thank you for sharing all that.
And I definitely want you to send me
that wealth checklist too,
'cause I want to perform that as well as myself.
And then one final thing I'll say on all this is like,
you know, we spent a lot of time lamenting politics,
lamenting, you know, the way the world is, you know,
obviously you and I,
we haven't even talked about the four attorney today,
which we can talk about next time we're on.
You know, there's a lot of negative stuff out there.
Obviously what's happening in the Middle East
and what's happening in Ukraine is pretty tragic.
What's been happening in Africa
for the past thousand years is pretty tragic.
You know what I mean?
It's easy to get tied down and bogged down
and really depressed about what's happening in the world.
But the reality is go out there and be the damn change
you want to see in the world.
You know, it's like, it's stop complaining,
stop lamenting, stop whining,
and just get out there and start fixing the world.
If everyone took that attitude and start fixing the world,
the world would be the place that we all want to see it,
see it become.
- Totally agree.
And you know, it's a mindset change,
but we have agency.
We tend to think, you know, this is all out of our control,
but we have agency, particularly at the local level.
And there are some, on some recent videos here,
I've been talking about sort of the stoic philosophy
and the sense that the obstacle is the way.
It's actually the thing that is preventing you,
that is thwarting you.
That's actually where the path to progress lies.
And you've got to just basically stop trying to avoid it,
ignore it, get around it,
and instead just dial into your cross hairs
and figure out a way to go through it.
So, all right, my friends, we could talk forever.
We really look forward to having you back on again soon
so we can continue picking this up.
And maybe at some point, we'll just have that beer.
You mentioned earlier too, that sounds pretty good too.
All right, well, look, everybody else,
thanks so much for watching.
If you've still got some stamina to watch,
I did a great recent interview with Kevin Muir,
publisher of The Macro Tourist.
It's actually very similar to a lot of what Darius
and I talked about here.
If you want to watch that after this one,
I'll put a link to it right here.
Darius, my friend, congratulations on baby Dale.
I can't wait to hear the news when you're a proud papa
and everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
