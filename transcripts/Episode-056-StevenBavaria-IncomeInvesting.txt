Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
Now, okay, folks, in today's video,
we're delivering on one of the most popular requests
you've been asking of me to produce a video
on how to invest for income.
We're joined today by Stephen Bavaria,
author of the book, "The Income Factory,"
an investor's guide to consistent lifetime returns.
Stephen, thanks so much for joining us today.
- It's a pleasure, Adam, thank you.
- Well, I really appreciate you jumping on
relatively short notice.
As I said, this is a very high interest topic
amongst this audience.
I appreciate you helping demystify
the world of income investing here for folks.
So as we jump off of that and then get into your framework,
you've got a very specific framework
you call the income factory.
But before we get to that, though,
we could just start at a very high level,
which is why invest for income?
A lot of people buy a stock or a security
because they hope it's gonna go up tomorrow.
Investing's a bit of a different strategy.
Why invest in it?
- Well, actually, the two tie together very well,
growth and income.
If you go back to basic economics,
and there was a guy named John Burr Williams,
an economist in the '30s who wrote the book
that is still the basis for investment theory
around the world, the value of any investment,
of any asset, really, when you come right down to it,
is the discounted present value of all the cash flow,
all the income that that asset is gonna generate
over the course of its life,
or the investor's life, certainly.
And we don't always realize that market values
go up and down for all kinds of reasons,
but the ultimate reason most of us are investing
is because we're looking to the assets
to ultimately generate an income for us.
And if we invest in a way that grows,
we can use cash flow from the investments,
reinvest it, and actually create our own growth.
In fact, this is the basis for my own philosophy
that I call the income factory,
but I came to it through my own investing
and realized that over time,
you actually can grow your wealth faster
and more consistently by concentrating on income
than you typically can for most investors
by looking at growth and focusing on market value.
And the reason for this is that they know
for the last hundred years or so,
equity on average has provided a return of nine or 10%.
If you can achieve a nine or 10% growth
on your investments over the course of your life,
you're going to double and then redouble
and redouble again the income or the value of it
about every eight years at a 9% rate.
Every, you know, it's the rule of 72.
You divide the yield into 72 and it tells you
how often it'll double and redouble itself.
But most people do not achieve this kind of a return
because they focus on market price.
And of course the media focuses on market price.
So we're kind of brainwashed to think about market prices
that go up and down.
Whereas typically 10 years later, 20 years later,
people don't even remember the price
at which they first bought a particular stock
if they're still holding it or bond or whatever.
But the income growth, you know, compounds and continues.
So for the typical person who invests in stocks,
they then, they watch it go up and down
because unlike bonds and other fixed income,
you don't have steady, you know,
growth due to dividend compounding or income compounding.
You have the ups and downs and the volatility.
And if, you know, if you're smart,
if we're all as wise as possible,
we would just invest in index funds and forget about it
for year after year after year, and we would do fine.
And Nobel prizes have been one telling people this.
But most of us, myself included,
don't have the iron will required
to sort of sit through volatility of all sorts.
And with a typical stock portfolio, you make,
if it's an S&P 500, for example,
you'd make one and a half percent in dividends.
And the rest of your nine or 10% equity growth
is dependent on growth year after year.
And you're not gonna get it every year.
So the years when you're getting minus 10%,
hopefully to be made up by other years
where you get plus 20%, let's say,
it's not exactly that mathematicians
will be calling and complaining, but you know what I mean.
It's hard to just sit and wait and watch.
So most people then try to hedge the volatility
by buying things like long-term bonds
and other fixed rate stuff where you get stability.
But yes, stability, but over the long-term
at a return of three or 4%,
if it's a typical investment grade
or government bond over the last 10 years,
it's up to four or so now for a while.
So you put it all together and you're lucky
if you blend the portfolio with these so-called
stable assets that are like a rock on a boat.
It gives it stability, but it slows it down.
And then your other equity portfolio
that maybe will grow at 10%,
but you combine the two and maybe you've got six, 7%.
And then people try to time the market
and that usually costs the money
'cause they're sitting on the sidelines
when the train starts to pull out of the station again
and the stocks take off.
So it's very, very hard for a typical investor
to just invest in equities and sit and watch it
and let it grow over the long-term,
which is what they would need to do.
So what I do with income investing
is try to find investments.
And there are plenty of them that they're more likely
to be high dividend stocks like utilities
and master limited partnerships
and things that are more income focused
and not growth focused.
And then I also use a lot of high yield bonds
and senior loans.
And I combine it with investing through closed end funds
where you can typically buy at discounts.
So you can get 9, 10%, 8, 9, 10% covered call funds
or another one.
You can get 8, 9, 10% consistently year after year
in real cash returns that you can reinvest
and create your own growth.
And you're not necessarily growing the market value
which may move all over the place,
but you're not paying attention to it.
You're looking at your income, your cash income
which is growing and compounding.
If you're in a growth mode, now, if you're a retiree
you may be taking some of this out and living on it
and just reinvesting parts of it.
And we'll talk about that later,
but you can therefore create your own growth, reinvest.
And when markets are down, this is a psychological thing
as well as a financial thing.
It's easier to sleep at night.
If you know your income is growing steadily
regardless of what the market prices are doing.
And when market prices are down,
you're reinvesting at even lower prices and higher yields.
So you're growing your income faster
even during periods when the market prices are down.
Like in 2022, I grew my income at about 11%.
My portfolio of, I invest in funds primarily,
closed-end funds and ETFs mostly
because I like the diversification.
I want professionals managing my money and not picking.
I would never wanna try to pick individual bonds
or loans myself, but I let professionals do it.
And so I've got a portfolio of funds invested in all this.
And some of those funds were down in paper value
in 2022, for example,
but they were cranking out their income
at a faster rate than ever, at a higher yield than ever.
And I was reinvesting.
So I've been consistently growing my income
at a nine, 10, 11% rate for as long as I've been doing this,
even though the value of it in terms of market value,
it bounces around, but I don't pay much attention.
And when I started writing about this,
taking this approach on seeking alpha primarily,
I was called a heretic.
I had people saying, you can't do that.
You've gotta have growth.
And I said, no, math is math.
If you make 10% yields and 0% growth
and 0% yields and 10% growth, and you compound it,
you're gonna end up at exactly the same place.
And I had to prove that on Excel spreadsheets
and stick them in my book and on articles.
And finally, now I've got thousands of followers
who tell me, gee, I'm sleeping better at night.
You've changed my life.
I've never thought of income investing
as it may not be sexy, but it sure works.
That's a long-winded answer, but there you go.
- No, it's a great answer.
And look, I think there's a lot of people watching
who you probably just got their attention first off
with just the nine to 10% annual average returns,
but also the fact that income generating assets
tend to have substantially lower risk
than a lot of growth assets.
And so to be able to earn that attractive a rate
with the relative safety of fixed income,
I'm sure folks are watching pretty intently right now.
So I'm really looking forward to getting
into this discussion.
You mentioned a couple of asset classes there
that folks might not be super familiar with.
So hopefully at some point we can just talk briefly
about what they are so they know how to go learn more
about them after this video.
Let me ask you this first.
So you said a lot of people, which is very true.
I would say the average retail investor tends
to invest more in stocks than in fixed income.
Fixed income instruments are a little mathy
that scares people.
Also what you sort of tend to hear
on the regular financial media,
you tend to hear much more about the equity side of things.
And I think that's just because it's more interesting.
It's, to use your term, it's a little more sexy.
Everybody loves a story like in Nvidia
or like the meme stocks when they were running
about how riches can be made overnight.
But a lot of that is,
it's riskier, but there's a line
I think that's been really blurred over the past decade
or more between investing and speculating.
And we have especially post the 2008 global financial crisis,
we enter this era where financial markets,
but particularly the equity side was supported
and juiced by a lot of central planner stimulus.
And you had a lot of years where the market
just had gain after gain after gain after gain.
And the mantra was buy the dips.
You've got the Fed put, the Fed's got your back here.
And as part of that program,
it drove interest rates down to zero practically.
And that made it really hard on the fixed income side
to generate an attractive return,
at least from a lot of people's perspectives.
Now what's different about the era we're in now
is you actually have yields up at a place
where they're somewhat meaningful again.
In fact, I think treasuries are now delivering a real return
which hasn't happened in a long time.
So is this now an even better environment
for those that want to build an income factory?
- I'd say probably yes.
Although it's always been perhaps a better environment
than people would have thought
if they were just looking at fixed income,
the way the media and others describe it.
It's very important to understand
that not all fixed income is the same.
And the bets we're taking, if you will,
when we invest in different parts of the fixed income market
we're taking very different bets.
We're investing in a different set of possibilities
and probabilities and expectations.
The typical fixed income commentary, say on CNBC,
doesn't even talk about the kind of fixed income
I would invest in.
They're talking about the treasury market,
the long-term bond investment grade bond market.
These are markets where you've got fixed rates,
you're going out 10, 20, even 30 years on treasuries.
You're basically betting on interest rate movements
and you're not being paid very much to take those bets
because you have virtually,
from a statistical point of view,
you have hardly any defaults in the investment grade sector,
especially the higher end of it.
And of course, in the treasury,
we don't know what's gonna happen to our government bonds,
our debt years from now.
But as long as it's denominated in US dollars
that they can create more of,
you're not gonna have defaults by the US government
in any foreseeable future.
So you're really betting on interest rates.
I'm talking about investing in credit.
Now, when you're investing in credit,
you're being paid real returns,
you're getting much higher yields
because you're taking real risk.
And high yield bonds and senior loans,
which are asset classes quite,
that are totally available to retail investors
through the closed end fund market especially,
you can get currently nine, 10, 11% returns, yields,
I should say yields on these asset classes
because you are taking real credit risk
but you're being well paid for it.
And credit risk,
here's something most people don't understand,
high yield bonds,
which basically started with Michael Milken
and way back in the '80s and got denominated,
they got called junk.
They're called junk bonds
'cause they're from non-investment grade companies.
The average, there's so many people say,
"Oh, I would never touch a junk bond,
it's so scary and risky."
Many of those people,
in fact, most of them probably already hold stock
in mid cap funds and small cap funds
that's issued by the same companies
who issue high yield bonds.
Now the non-investment grade companies,
most companies that we've ever seen
are non-investment grade
and the stock issued by these companies
that is bought universally by investors
who have highly diversified stock portfolios,
small caps, mid caps is all below on the balance sheet
the debt that these investors say,
"Oh, I'd never buy that, that's high yield bond."
Well, unless those high yield bonds are paid off,
the stock that many of those investors already own
is worthless because if the company goes bust,
you're not gonna get anything back as a stockholder.
But if you're a bond holder
or especially a secured senior loan holder
and senior loans are a big investment,
a big asset class I like,
you're gonna probably lose on a high yield bond,
you'll have a recovery of maybe 40%.
So you'll lose 60%.
On a senior loan, you'll have a recovery of 60 or 70%.
So you lose 30%.
So even in a normal year when defaults are say 2%,
if they're that high on non-investment grade companies,
you might lose half of that.
You might lose 1%.
If you lose 50% and you've had defaults
on 2% of your portfolio,
then your loss will be half of that, 1%, 50% times 2%.
So, and then even in a recession,
you might have 5% default.
So you lose half of that, that's 2.5%,
which you're earning 10%.
So 2.5% might reduce your earnings that year to seven,
but it won't even touch your principal.
So there's a lot more security and predictability
in the credit markets, the real credit markets,
where you get paid for taking credit risks
than there is in any equity market.
And this is why I find once I start explaining to people
what you're really betting on and what the risks are,
it makes a lot more sense to them.
And they say, wow, I never knew that.
And then they, I have a lot of readers
and members of my group that just,
they tell me a couple of years later, wow, this is great.
I never knew you could invest like this and get,
you know, these kinds of returns and sleep at night.
- Okay, great.
You fast forwarded to a question I was gonna ask
around some of the dead instruments
that are lower on the seniority ladder.
You just answered that question, which is great.
And I think that is a great reframing in people's mind is,
hey, if you're running a stock, you know,
and in most companies, like you said,
unless it's a real big blue chip company,
it's probably not an investment grade company.
And if that company gets into trouble,
your stock's gonna take a much bigger loss
than whatever variety of debt you have
because the debt is higher on the seniority list
than the equity.
- May I make one little point too?
- Absolutely.
- I like to think about this is
when you get into credit investing
and a good 50% or more of my portfolio and my models
is in credit investing.
And part of the equity that we invest in
is the equity of business development corporations,
which in fact, all they do is make credit.
So I consider that part of credit as well.
But I think of it as if you went to a horse race,
we went to a racetrack,
if you could bet on the whole field of horses
to just make it around the track and finish the race,
that's what credit investing is.
You're just betting on companies to not go bust,
to stay alive.
And even if they don't do well,
even if their stock tanks,
as long as the management keeps the company alive
and the horse makes it around the track,
you're gonna do fine.
You're gonna get paid.
When you bet on stocks,
it's like betting on a horse to win place or show.
It's gotta do well.
It's gotta not only survive and finish the race,
it's gotta increase its earnings and its stock price.
So it's a very different bet.
So unless you're getting paid a lot more to buy the equity,
you're better off just taking the credit bet.
- That is a great analogy.
So a bond, a credit instrument, it's contract, right?
It basically says, hey, if I'm still around by time X,
I will have paid you this along the way
and then we'd give you your principal back, right?
So your point, that horse just needs to finish the race.
- Even if the companies really run into problems,
laid off half its people,
I've worked for companies that have had to do that,
but they have to meet their contracts
and pay their debts or they're gone.
And let's be honest,
the CEOs of companies and other people,
I wrote a book called "Too Greedy for Adam Smith"
about CEO pay and how it's out of control,
but CEOs and the other management of these companies
have enormous skin in the game
to do whatever they have to do to muddle through
and keep their companies alive.
And that's really,
when you think of corporate America that way,
even in the worst recessions,
you've got most managements have just got enormous skin
in the game to kind of get their debt holders paid,
no matter what happens to their stockholders.
And that's what I'm betting.
- So, yeah, so here you're basically saying, look,
investing in this type of world,
you've got the system pulling for you.
The system's own self-interest is trying to help you out here.
All right, well, look,
I think we've laid a lot of good groundwork here.
Let's perhaps transition to,
in just a second, 'cause I got one more question.
I want to shoehorn in first,
but let's transition to your framework here
of the income factory.
What exactly is it?
How does one build it?
And then maybe what are some of the elements
that people could put together
to create their own income factory?
Very quickly, I should have asked this earlier,
but how should an income strategy, the need to,
like basically who should be investing for income?
Is it just as relevant for a 23-year-old
as it is for a 67-year-old,
or obviously does age and personal situation
come into play here?
- Well, here again, it has to do with psychology
and what your personal comfort level is.
And of course, I know a lot more now 50 years later
than I did when I was in my 20s.
But ideally, if you were a 20-year-old,
you'd set aside, and most people can do this
if they're in a company where they have a 401k or something,
you'd set aside certain amount of money
and you'd invest it mostly in equities, frankly,
although a lot of people are encouraged.
Oh yeah, put a portion in bonds.
Well, they're just slowing it down.
If you're in for the long, long term,
you'd be better off just investing your entire 401k
in equities and then forgetting about it.
Rip Van Winkle would have been a great investor
if he had invested in the S&P 500 or whatever first
and then forgotten about it.
- Sorry to interject.
A funny data point on that is apparently I've heard
that people who work at big brokerages,
they often say the best performing accounts
are those for people who have died
and the family hasn't come and claimed the assets
and they don't make any changes.
And so they tend to do the best over time.
- That's right.
Now, I'm not recommending death as a strategy,
but you're right, that makes a lot of sense.
The only problem with that is,
and in fact, I would not recommend,
if somebody has the guts, the wherewithal
and personal confidence to do that
and to just sit on it and not worry about it,
I would not recommend that they take
an income factory approach.
But for those of us, and I'm one of them,
who frankly, during the periods where it's down
and you're kind of worrying, gee, I hope it's coming back.
I hope this isn't the 1930s again
and we're in for a 10 year or longer depression here
and we need a war to get us out of it.
For somebody who's unable or finds it uncomfortable
to sit and just watch their equity investments
go up and down, even though they know
they're not gonna need to touch the money
for 10 years or 20 years or 30 years,
the income factory, by allowing them
to create their own growth, by investing
in a pool of assets, you need wide diversification,
but a pool of assets that's gonna provide
a steady 8%, 9%, 10%.
Sometimes, like the last couple of years,
we've gotten 11%, but I don't expect 11% year after year.
But even if I get eight or 9% consistently,
I'm pretty happy then, regardless of what the price does
in the interim, because I'm compounding
and growing the income.
And that 27 year old, that's what they really,
even if they don't fully realize it,
that's what they really need 40 years later,
their portfolio to be providing an income
that they can easily live on in retirement
or whatever they're planning to do at that point.
So either approach works, but it's nice
to have the alternative because if you didn't have
an income factory alternative, then your alternative
might be to start taking money out of the market
at difficult times, so you sleep better,
putting it in the sidelines, investing in low return,
long-term bonds, and then all you're doing
is decreasing your potential return,
both in the short-term and often in the long-term
if you've tied yourself into long-term low return assets.
- Yeah, so we interview, well, I mean,
a lot of experienced investors who share your sentiment
that we as humans can be our own worst enemies here
at times in the stock market, and I've interviewed
a number of behavioral economists who have the science,
the behavioral science that goes into all of that.
And what I really like about your approach is
you just say, "Look, it's just math."
You're just putting the power of math in your corner here
so that if you can not get too emotionally charged
and tinker with it and screw things up,
the math should see you through in the long run.
- That's right, and it's especially comforting
during those periods, and 2022 is the most recent,
when stocks were universally down,
and if you were only making a 1.5% dividend
on your S&P 500 or whatever,
but seeing the rest of it tank,
to instead be earning your 9, 10%,
and seeing it reinvested in an even higher yield
than it had been a year ago, I'll tell you,
it really, you feel an awful lot more comfortable
and sanguine about your investment strategy
than you would if all you saw was the downside.
- All right, very understandable.
So I think we've whetted people's interest enough here,
so let's get to the meat of the discussion here.
So tell us, what is an income factory
and how do you construct one?
- Well, an income factory, I mean,
at a high level definition,
an income factory would be a portfolio
that you've invested in various assets
that generate high current yields
on a regular basis,
but where you're not necessarily expecting growth.
I mean, ideally, if you bought something
that was earning you 10% forever,
a portfolio, let's say, that would generate 10
and didn't grow at all,
and you were able to compound it,
or even if you were retired
and you took 5% or 6% of it out,
but you left 4% in to continue growing
'cause even if you're 70, you may live to 90
and you wanna make sure you don't outlive your money,
that would be an equally good alternative.
So you start at the high level by saying,
okay, I'm committed to earning,
creating most of my growth through current yields.
So that's at a high level.
So then step two is you say, okay, what are the asset classes
that I can consider?
I think this is where you'd like to go now, right?
What are the asset classes we should consider
that would meet this requirement?
And then what would be a portfolio
that would contain those?
And I'd say in general,
they would be the kind of credit assets
I already mentioned,
like there are a lot of senior loan funds in the,
especially in the closed end fund world.
I like the closed end fund world
because if you're careful when you buy,
you can often buy at discounts.
So you end up buying a fund at an 8% or 10% discount
to its net asset value.
So you get a bunch of assets that are earning you,
that are earning 8% or 9% yields,
but because you've only paid 90% of their market price,
because you got them at a discount,
they're actually generating a higher yield for you.
So you have senior loan funds and they're run,
you wanna buy funds run by real professional organizations.
There are senior loan funds run by Aries and Apollo
and Blackstone and BlackRock and Invesco.
Just, you know, give you an example,
Blackstone is another one.
I mean, these are companies I know
because I spent years and years in banking.
And when I was at Standard and Poor's,
I developed the first ratings
that were ever assigned to corporate loans.
Corporate loans had never been rated before.
So it's an area I,
that's why I got into this
because I'm familiar with these kinds of assets.
So senior loans and then the high yield bonds I mentioned.
And again, you've got a lot of high yield bond funds,
they're earning in the,
they're yielding in the eight, 9%,
some of them higher areas.
And you wanna, again,
buy funds that are run by really solid organizations
that, you know, know this well.
PIMCO, of course, is well known for its fixed assets.
Although they're not so much into the corporate areas,
they are into the more standard bond areas.
But you've got KKR, and again, Aries and Credit Suisse,
oh, you know, BlackRock again.
And some of the insurance companies like Bearings,
which is owned by Mass Mutual is probably the best,
has one of the best records out there.
It's high yield bond funds.
I'll give you a couple MCI and MPV,
if anybody wants to check out.
But they've been at the top of the list for years
in terms of their total return as high yield bond funds.
And what makes some of these,
why it's important to have really great management teams
run by organizations that have been around a long time
is that a lot of these funds,
they have great relationships with private equity firms.
So even if they're lending
in the middle market corporate area,
they're lending to companies that are owned
by other big firms that have a lot of skin in the game.
So if you do run into credit problems,
you've got an owner who's willing to work with you
to try to prevent losses.
So it really, there's a lot of sort of sophisticated people,
organizations that are running these funds.
And as retail investors,
we can sort of tag on to their expertise
and benefit from it.
So high yield bonds.
- Just for one sec, Stephen.
So just to clarify for folks,
so it sounds like you're saying,
look, don't just pick an index fund, right?
Pick a fund that is actively managed
by one of these professional managers.
And a lot of the names that you've mentioned here,
I'll say a lot of retail investors don't have a lot of love
for these guys because they kind of look at them
as the guys that are dominating the system
and slanting the playing field
to their advantage and whatnot.
But I think what you're saying is when these guys are smart,
they're winning the financial arms race
where they've amassed a huge army of quantitative analysts
and other sorts of advantages.
And they have the relationships.
So they can kind of play a little bit unfairly
to their advantage and you can use that advantage
to your advantage as the small guy here
by letting them be the guys
who captain your actively managed fund here.
- That's an interesting way to look at it.
- You don't have to agree with it, but.
- No, I don't think of them as playing unfairly,
but you're absolutely right.
People who do things for a living and are closer to it
are more likely to have the connections and the knowledge.
And I'm not talking about inside information
or anything like that, but they know how the game is played
and they've been doing it for years.
And some of the top rated funds
are in fact run by these people.
Like I mentioned MCI MPV, because in the whole,
in what used to be called the private placement market,
I don't know, maybe you're hearing a lot lately
about the so-called private credit market,
which a lot of the big names in finance and investing
are talking about, it's like they've just discovered
private credit in the last year or so
and have been writing articles and everything about it.
But private credit has been going on for generations.
When I was a journalist for a brief period
during my kind of midlife career switching,
I used to write about the private placement market
and some of these insurance companies
like the Prudential, Mass Mutual,
they dominated the field in private placements
which were non-public debt.
Corporations would come to them
and they would float a bond issue for them
and sell it to other insurance companies.
And this has turned into the so-called private credit market
and now you have lots of big investors involved in it.
But these guys are pros.
And yeah, I like letting pros run my money.
I wouldn't dare go out and try to buy
individual high yield bonds
from individual high yield companies,
but having Aries and Prudential and Mass Mutual
and other people making decisions for me
and having highly diversified portfolios like that,
that I can buy at discounts in the closed-end fund market,
yeah, I really like that.
- All right, great.
So I'm sorry, I interrupted you.
So we've gone through- - Oh no, I'm glad you did.
- High yield bond funds.
What else would you put in there?
- Well, then you've got their real estate.
Now real estate's really in the dumpster right now,
but it seems to be turning around.
Real estate has been, for generations,
has been a good provider of steady,
you know, higher yielding returns.
You don't get the growth, but you get, you know, you get-
- You get the cash flow.
- Yeah, and so there are, you know,
there are real estate funds that one can look at.
Cohen and Steers is a big company
that runs closed-end funds.
They have a lot of real estate funds
that have been around for ages that have done well.
You know, so I would say the real estate,
there are lots of REITs around,
but then there are funds that buy REITs.
So, but real estate definitely would be something
you might want to include.
Some others, you know, utilities and infrastructure
is another asset class that while they're stocks,
they tend to pay higher dividends.
Often they're regulated or,
well, now with infrastructure companies,
sometimes they own regulated utilities.
Sometimes they own toll roads.
They own all kinds of things that generate regular income.
And if you, again, if you buy these
in the closed-end fund world,
you've got some that have just been around for ages
and pay nice, steady dividends in the 8% and larger,
but some of the really solid ones like the,
there's one called Reeves Utility Income Fund.
It's a symbol of UTG that's been a,
it's been an investor favorite for, you know, for years.
And it's real solid and it pays a yield of about 8.5%.
And it's increased its dividend about 12 times
in the last 20 years or so.
- Okay, and is the theme pretty consistent
amongst each of these asset classes where you're saying,
you know, find ideally a closed-end fund
that's professionally managed.
If you're buying a closed-end fund,
look to try to buy it at a discount,
but again, more importantly,
find a professional manager with a good track record
in this space.
- Yeah, you want funds with really good track records
that have been around a while.
And then the other thing is, yeah,
you're looking for investments that,
yeah, they may grow over time,
but you're mostly looking at a dividend
that if that's all you got,
you'd probably be pretty happy most years
to just get that and reinvest it.
And you're gonna end up with a portfolio
that maybe has an average return of nine to 10%
in terms of yield,
but you'll have some superstars in it
that are earning in the mid teens,
yielding in the mid teens,
and you'll have others that are,
and we haven't gotten to those yet, but we will.
And you have others that are, you know,
yielding in the seven, eight, 9%.
And you mix them all together, well-diversified,
and you've got your equity return in yield
that you can compound as long as you want to
to get that equity growth.
- And I'm probably jumping the gun here.
Again, I don't want to interrupt your flow here,
but it seems to me that sort of you can project
with confidence,
or you can probably project with more confidence
what you're gonna end up with over a period of time,
10, 20, 30 years or so,
because you're basically saying, right,
I'm putting my principle in, it's gonna grow at X,
I'm gonna reinvest the X, right, every year,
so that I can calculate that compounding.
And then I'm gonna hopefully contribute,
you know, just from my own savings,
a certain amount every year,
so I can put that into the equation.
And then you put all that into Excel
and you pretty much can say, all right,
in 30 years, I should have this amount
and barring something crazy.
- That's right.
And the something crazies that you are not including,
I mean, when you say barring it,
you'll still think of them, but you can't always project.
I mean, interest rate levels,
which are driven by inflation rates as well,
they're going to change over time.
And if you think about what your return
on a credit investment is,
you've got a base rate that's a kind of interest free rate,
which was zero, you know, over much of the last 15 years,
but now is something more real, more like 3%, 4%,
whatever, you know, short-term government bill rates are.
And then to that, you add your credit risk.
So some of these same assets
that are now earning us 10 or 11% in yield,
we're probably only yielding six and 7% 10 years ago,
because they were on a base rate that was much lower.
So over time, you know,
if we really got inflation down to zero again,
and I mean, it's quite likely that we might only earn
seven or 8% and reinvest and compound that
at certain points in the future,
but we'd probably be pretty happy with that
because the economy would be,
I mean, there'd be a lot of different things going on.
When you have lower interest rates for longer,
then you're discounting the future value of the cash flows
at a lower discount rate.
So they're actually gonna then be valued more by a market.
Now, I don't know anyone
who expects interest rates to go down.
The level of interest rates we're at right now
is actually, while it seems high to many people,
is about the average sort of rates we've had
for the last 50 to 75 years for those who are old enough
to kind of remember back.
So I think most, you know, most people I know
don't expect rates to drop all that much,
even when they finally start to go down.
Now to kind of continue on,
there are some other asset classes that are very attractive.
There's a specific one.
Well, you have the business development company.
I mentioned those earlier.
BDCs, which many of your investors
are probably already familiar with,
are specialized companies that invest in,
for the most part, middle market corporates.
And that's all they do.
And they are like little mini banks,
except they're far less risky in many ways than banks.
They're not nearly as leveraged.
They can only leverage themselves, I think,
about two to one max.
And instead of relying on deposits
that can walk out the door in a bank run,
they have long-term liabilities.
So they have a liability side of their balance sheet
that's far more fixed and under their control
and that they can match to their asset side better.
So BDCs, they've had a terrific run
over the past year or so,
but I rely on them
and I like them a lot as an asset class.
And they're actually,
there are some ETFs that are available.
There's one called, well, Putnam,
Putnam up in Boston, Putnam BDC,
with the P-B-D-C as the symbol,
was just launched last year
and it's an actively managed ETF that invests in BDC.
So that's one I like.
I like the idea of an actively managed ETF.
And then there's another ETF run by,
it's called B-I-Z-D, the VanEck BDC ETF,
but it's B-I-Z-D.
And it's got a very good record,
but it's, and it's been around much longer,
but it's interesting how P-B-D-C,
the actively managed BDC,
beat B-I-Z-D, which is more of an index type of BDC fund,
by about three percentage points over the past year.
They both did very well.
Like B-I-Z-D had a total return of 27% for the past year,
but P-B-D-C beat it with 30%.
So last year was a very good year
for credit investing generally and for BDCs.
But I really like BDCs
'cause they're actively managed companies.
They're kind of like mini banks.
And I think they're gonna be around doing what they do,
cranking out nine, 10, 11% yields,
certainly in the closed end fund sort of wrapper
for a long time.
And then there's also,
I don't know if any of your readers, listeners, watchers,
viewers are familiar with CLOs,
collateralized loan obligations,
but these are securitized vehicles
that were only open to institutional investors
for many, many years,
where they would take senior corporate loans,
secured corporate loans and securitize them,
put them into a pool.
This started about 30 some years ago
when corporate loans were first becoming traded
outside of the banking world.
And CLOs, these collateralized loan obligations
are leveraged pools of senior loans.
So the equity in them and the debt,
they have different tranches of debt,
have been very popular as a number of retail funds
have come out in the last 10 years
to allow retail investors to invest in these.
And they've been, I mean, they're not for the faint hearted.
I've written articles explaining what they are,
but they've, as a small portion of one's portfolio,
I mean, a couple of the funds are now generating yields
that they're fully covering
with their current cashflow of 16, 17, 18%.
And then there are some other ones that buy CLO debt,
which is less risky than CLO equity.
And even some of them are earning
and paying yields in the 14, 15% range.
So CLOs are another asset class worth including
in a small amount, in a diversified income factory.
And then you've got covered call funds,
which you may be familiar with,
which are their equity funds.
Eaton Vance is big and highly regarded
in the covered call area
and has a whole bunch of closed end funds that they run.
But covered call funds are kind of an interesting investment
to include as well, because they invest in stocks,
some of the same stocks that growth stock funds invest in,
but then they sell covered calls.
So they're kind of selling off a portion
of the potential income.
If you knew the stocks were gonna go up
and you were positive of that,
you'd never sell a covered call on it.
But if you don't know that for sure,
it's a nice way to convert, to increase the regular income
on the fund so that you're trading off potential growth
for a steady income.
So covered call funds and many of these generate
nice steady yields of seven, 8%,
and they've been doing it for years.
They're a nice component of an income factory as well.
- So we've got senior loans, real estate, high yield bonds,
and then they're plain old equity funds that,
especially in the closed end fund world,
there are a lot of equity funds
that are kind of growth type funds,
but they pay out their growth as they earn it,
as they make capital gains, they actually pay it out.
So they have much higher yields than a typical sort of fund
sort of index fund would have.
And there are quite a few of those
that are in the closed end fund world.
Some of you want some names?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, like the Adams Diversified Equity Fund, ADX,
has been around for years generating solid returns.
And you've got Liberty All Star Growth,
which is another oldie but goodie
in the closed end fund world,
in a lot of pretty conservative portfolios, I would guess.
It's ASG.
And then you've got Charlie Royce.
People may know he's well, probably in his 80s now,
but the Royce Value Trust, the Royce Micro Cap Trust,
they've been around for years earning really solid returns.
They're growth funds, more likely to be mid cap,
but they pay out nice dividend.
They convert their growth,
their capital gains into a steady income.
They know that closed end fund investors
are typically more interested
in getting their money out regularly as dividends
than in seeing it just,
they'd rather do the growing themselves by compounding
than with a typical growth stock,
the stock just does the growth internally
and pays you 1% or whatever.
- All right, so sorry to be repetitive here,
but pretty much in every asset class you've mentioned so far,
the strategy is the same.
You typically buy closed end funds,
ideally try to buy them at a discount if you can,
but look for a good senior manager
with the long track record.
So even here on the equity funds,
same deal, closed end funds.
- Absolutely, that's right.
This is why funds,
I don't claim to be a great stock picker.
I'm good at theory and I call,
I think of myself as a portfolio manager,
more than a individual stock analyst.
That's why I like to,
I spend my time finding funds run by people
who know a lot more than I do
and have been doing it a long time.
And it works so far.
- Great, so I mean,
what I kind of take from your approach here
is you're leveraging the sort of safety of the contract
with these instruments.
You're leveraging math,
having a strong sense of what you're gonna get back
and how it's gonna compound,
and you're leveraging expertise and competitive advantage
by going after or letting the active management be done
by the really big successful guys.
- That's right.
Which is why for people willing to do enough research,
which might mean,
and I'm not just trying to promote my own stuff,
but I mean, I've spent a lot of years writing about this,
doing articles on Seeking Alpha about it.
And so most of the people that are followers of mine
or members of my investment service
are smart retail investors who do it themselves.
But what they're doing is pretty,
you don't need the level of expertise to pick funds
that you do to pick individual stocks or bonds.
And so that's what I try to do is give people,
I try to keep it as simple as I can,
and that's why we stick to funds and funds run by pros.
- Okay, before I get to my next questions,
were there any other major asset classes here
you'd wanna mention?
- No, I think we got the basic ones.
No, that would be about right.
I mean, we covered stocks, bonds,
major corporate debt instruments,
and some special things like DDCs and CLOs.
- All right, well, I really appreciate you mentioning
certain fund companies that folks can look into.
You haven't gave some tickers along the way.
I just wanna underscore for folks,
both for Stephen's sake and mine,
none of this is personal financial advice.
These are just things to go consider.
I'm gonna make my pitch in a little bit,
my standard pitch for why most people,
unless you're experienced DIY,
should work under the guidance
of a good professional financial advisor
and/or follow somebody like Stephen
who has a service that shows you all the analysis
and lets you actually do the work on your own.
But yes, none of this is personal financial advice.
- No, and I would add anything I write
and any of my service, I make a point of saying,
what I'm doing is sharing my own opinions
of what I do and how I invest and what works for me so far,
but there's no assurance it's gonna keep working for me
or guarantees that, we're all in this together
kind of helping each other,
but none of us are professionals
and certainly there are no guarantees.
- Okay.
Well, look, can you talk for a bit about the,
just differentiate for our viewers,
the accumulation phase of the income factory, right?
Which is that, hey, like I'm in my early fifties, right?
I'm gonna be building the factory.
I'm gonna be putting money into it,
hopefully for a good while, not taking money out.
So contrast that versus the withdraw phase.
How does the factory work when people start taking
a partial or total annual returns out?
- Okay, that's a good question and I get it a lot.
When you think about total return on any investment,
your total return is the amount of cash you collect,
say in any period, say in a year.
It's the amount of cash you collect from that investment
and the amount by which that investment goes up or down.
Now, at any age, you have a choice at the end of any year,
what to do with that total return.
Now, if the total return is mostly
in the form of capital growth,
then you always have the option
of selling some of your assets,
taking some of the growth and harvesting it
and collecting it for whatever you need it for,
to build a house, buy a car, whatever,
send your kids to college.
Now, once you get into a retirement phase,
that really doesn't change.
It's just that most retirees have more of a need.
When you're in your accumulative phase
from age 25 to 55 or 60 or 65,
you've still got the choice each year.
Do I need to take money out for some reason or another?
But you're mostly, you're right, gonna leave it in.
If you want it to grow, you'll mostly leave it in.
And if it's in an IRA or something,
you'll definitely wanna leave it in.
When you become, once you're retired,
people who have traditional investment strategies
almost have to start selling assets
because they're only gonna get one and a half
or 2% in dividend payments.
So they have to start selling off some of their growth.
Hopefully not all of it though.
If you've got an income factory
and you're getting it all in the form of income,
then your choice becomes,
how much do I wanna keep of that income
and how much do I wanna reinvest it?
So if you've got a traditional portfolio
and you're earning on average 10% a year,
some years you won't earn any of that,
you have no choice but to sell off some of your assets
each year if you need it to live on with,
whether you've earned a capital gain or not.
With an income factory, if you're earning 10%
or whatever in yield, it's your choice.
They generally say you shouldn't take out more than what,
five, 6% or so, 7% and they oughta keep the rest in
and let it grow.
I mean, that's gonna depend on your outlook,
how much other income you have, all that stuff.
But I'd say the average person 65 or 70
should still be thinking of themselves
as in an accumulative phase,
even if they're taking out 5% or so,
because you might live to 90.
I mean, my grandparents and my father lived in 96.
I'm in my 70s, but I'm still thinking growth
because I wanna at least prepare
for being around 20 more years,
even if I'm not lucky enough to make it.
So, I mean, so seriously, this is a question
that doesn't really change that much
just because you go from being 50 to 60 to 70, it's more,
but if you do have an income factory
where it's all coming in in cash,
it's a much easier decision about,
because you're used to reinvesting it anyway.
Now it's just a question of, well,
maybe each year I'll cut back the amount
I reinvest by a little bit and keep it.
And how much you keep will depend
on what your current needs are as a retiree,
if you're living solely on that.
You know what I mean?
So it's very much, it's a lot easier
with an income factory to make the decision
'cause you always have cash that's coming in.
You don't have to sell stocks that might be down.
- Right, right, it seems to me,
rather than kind of building a nest egg
that you're gonna then withdraw,
draw down in your twilight years,
you're building a pension plan.
- That's right.
- That is paying you an annual salary
and then you can just determine
how much of that you wanna take
and how much of it you wanna reinvest.
But even if you take all of it,
you're not actually dipping into your principle there.
- That's the critical point.
And that's why it's so important.
To look at the source of a fund's yield,
if it's paying you a yield every year
and it's paying it from interest that it,
what they call net investment income in the fund world.
If you're collecting net investment income,
which means the interest or dividends the fund receives,
and it's not dipping into its own capital gains
in order to pay you that yield,
then you can be a lot more comfortable
spending more of that yield
and not reinvesting it
than if it were from a stock fund
where they're dipping, they're selling you,
they're eating their seed corn, so to speak,
to pay you a dividend
because they didn't have the capital gains that year
to cover it.
I've written a lot about that.
And that's a real issue.
As people get closer to retirement,
it makes more sense to have an income factory approach
because you're more likely to have a portfolio
that generates cashflow each year,
even if its paper value is going up or down,
because you won't have to sell any of those assets
and sell it at those lower paper values.
- And let's talk about the paper values for a second.
So you've done a good job of laying out the benefits
of the income factories.
I'd love to your thoughts on any risks
that folks would need to keep in mind.
And one that comes into my mind,
and maybe it's a real risk, maybe it's not,
you can correct me, is
let's say I was assembling an income factory myself,
or I was picking the individual bonds to go into,
the individual assets to go in it.
I would have the guarantee that if I held them to maturity,
no matter what happened along the way with prices,
I'd get my principal back.
Some of these ETFs don't,
I presume they don't necessarily give you that guarantee
if you were to sell the ETF,
you're just selling it whatever the market price
of the ETF is at that given moment, right?
So what kind of risk is there that,
yes, it's churning off the income you want over time,
but you might have a life event or whatever
where you need to start selling the principal
and it's substantially lower
than you'd like it to be 30 years down the road
versus that guaranteed principal return.
How big of a factor is that in your outlook here?
- That's always going to be a factor,
whether you've got a stock portfolio
or a fixed income, income factory type portfolio,
the market can always react negatively as it has
in the last few years, there've been years where,
I mean, in my own personal portfolio,
it's actually right at a breakeven point right now,
which I'm delighted at because I've been collecting
10 and 11% yields for years on it.
But there was a time when it was way down
a couple of years ago in paper value,
but it was continuing to crank out the income.
And I'd say if somebody thinks they're likely
to have a life event and some aren't,
you can't project everything,
but if you know your kids are going to college
in so many years,
or you're saving up to buy a house or something,
those kinds of things you should probably set aside
a portion of your savings for,
and invest it in something that's not as volatile.
For those, well, shorter term treasuries
and shorter term bonds that currently
you can get 5% or so on.
I mean, that's not what I'm looking for
for my whole portfolio,
but if I were saving a certain amount of money
for equity on a home or send my kids to college,
and I knew it was gonna be in a few years,
I would be more likely to set aside,
to do something like that.
But the major risk, I would say,
for the long-term investor is you always have the risk
that today's dividend, or that you'll have some losses,
or that yield rates will drop,
and that your fund that's now paying you 9%
might drop and only pay you 8 1/2%.
I mean, this is real.
This is why I set my goals.
Even though I've been earning 10 and 11%
for the last couple of years,
I keep telling myself and readers that look,
this is special.
Because you've had so much volatility in the market,
there've been fears of a recession that hasn't come yet.
Maybe it will or not.
There've been discounts on loans and bonds
that a smart fund manager can buy bonds and loans
at discounts when they're existing,
and then they mature if they don't go bust,
and 98% of them don't.
You buy something at 92 cents on the dollar,
and then they resell it, or not resell it,
it matures in a few years, and the company pays off at par.
You've got a nice capital gain there.
So there's been a lot of that boosting returns lately
as loans and bonds have been selling
at bigger discounts than usual
because of all the angst in the market.
Now, so you have things that can influence
the size of your cashflow over time.
And so, yeah, you can't fall in love with 10%.
And you have to realize that, hey,
I might be compounding at 8% in five years or 10 years,
but as long as you're compounding,
it's still gonna grow.
But yeah, the fact that nothing is assured
and that rates from yields from funds aren't guaranteed,
that can vary, and it has,
but it hasn't affected the overall effectiveness
of the strategy so far.
- All right, and we get to start wrapping up here,
unfortunately, but it's been a fascinating discussion.
I'm curious, pre-interest rates getting hiked
to where they are right now,
back when we were sort of in a zerp world.
I'm just curious, what type of returns
was your income factory portfolio returning?
- Well, yeah, I started, I get more and more,
this became more and more my way of investing.
I mean, I transitioned from a more traditional
form of investing, but I'd say-
- But your book came out in early 2020,
so right before everything went crazy.
- That's right, I'd say back then,
I was talking more about eight to 9%
as my more realistic target level of yields,
I would have been happy to kind of,
for a lifetime of yields at eight or 9%,
and just compounding them.
This getting 10, 11, 12% over the last couple of years,
it's been great, but I keep trying to tell myself
and my readers that we can't count on this forever,
but on the other hand, I don't expect it to go back
to a zero rate program.
- Rate environment, yeah.
So all I want to say is, yeah, 8%.
- Yeah, the long-term mortgage rate,
the 30-year mortgage rate average for the last 50 years
was something like 7% or so,
just to kind of keep that in mind.
- Keep it in perspective, yeah.
So yeah, I just wanted to point out that 8%
in a ZERP world on the fixed income side, credit side,
not so bad.
I know a lot of people that'd be interested in that.
And I just remember in 2022,
when everybody's portfolio was doing poorly
because stocks and bonds were going down.
I can't tell you how many people, Steven, came to me
and said, "God, if I could just find a way to get 4%
consistently going forward from here, I'll be happy.
I don't need anything more than that, right?
Just something that I can sleep at night in
and get a consistent 4%.
And you're offering something that, I mean, no guarantees,
but has been performing at twice or better than that
with the ability to sleep.
- That's right.
And even a very, even a most conservative investor,
if I were to sit down and get rid of the,
some of the things I own that are more aggressive,
you could probably pretty much count on it,
7% or 8% return yield indefinitely.
- Okay, all right.
Well, look, thank you for doing this.
You've done a really great job in helping beginning
to demystify the world of income generating assets
for our viewers here.
You've definitely given something to them to chew on.
Like I said, the structure of what you're offering here,
I think to many people, it sounds pretty compelling.
Obviously everybody got to do your own research.
An important part of that research
could be reading your book.
So Steven, if folks want to read your book,
where can they get it?
- Oh, well, they can get it.
If I were one of these people that's interviewed
all the time on CNBC, I'd have a whole bunch of these
on a bookshelf behind me all through the show.
But no, on Amazon, the income factory, there it is.
- So go to Amazon or wherever they sell books.
Before we turned on the camera,
we were sort of talking about how solutions like yours
don't get a lot of air time on the traditional
financial media because they're not sexy.
What sells is the boom of the day,
which stock just went up 30% yesterday
because of some news.
And also, a lot of these media companies,
their advertisers are big ETFs
and they tend to be on the equity side.
And fixed income is sometimes like watching paint dry.
But if your horse finishes the race
and that's all you need to do to win,
as an investor, that's great.
But as a network trying to get people to tune in tomorrow
for the next big soundbite,
it's not super effective for that, right?
- Oh, absolutely right.
And in fact, in my book, I spend the introduction
and my favorite chapter, chapter two, is why do we invest?
What makes us wealthy?
And I talk about this transition that's taken place.
Back when people had pension plans
and they didn't have to run their own money,
they weren't watching TV nearly as much.
But with a media that requires people to worry about growth
and indexes and the sort of things that they focus on,
yeah, you're not gonna hear much about letting the paint dry
with boring income factory strategies,
but I appreciate your interest in it.
- No, well, thanks.
Well, it's just reflecting our audience's interest in it.
So for folks that have really enjoyed this conversation,
whether they get your book or not,
where else can they go to follow you in your work?
- Well, if they follow Seeking Alpha,
I've been writing on Seeking Alpha for 20 years.
That's a worldwide website focused on investing.
It's got millions of readers
and actually thousands of writers, contributors.
And I became one 20 years ago or so.
And then a few years ago,
they invited some of the more popular writers, I guess,
to set up separate investment subscription services
that they host on Seeking Alpha.
So I took, by then I'd written my income factory book.
So I created a service inside the income factory.
So people can read public articles of mine on Seeking Alpha,
or they can take the next step
and investigate my inside the income factory service.
There's a free trial available and all that.
- All right, that's great.
So if they go to Seeking Alpha
and they type in your name, Steven Bavaria,
they'll find you.
- If they Google Steven Bavaria,
they'll find all this stuff, yeah.
- Okay, great.
And Steven, we'll put links to your book and your free
and your premium sub stack, sorry, Seeking Alpha page
in the description below this video.
So folks, if you wanna get just direct one click access
to that, you'll find it there.
All right, so Steven, I've got one last question for you
and I'll give you about a minute to chew on it
'cause I gotta do some housekeeping first.
And folks, you're gonna wanna hear the housekeeping
'cause there's some interesting resources for you there.
But the question is going to be,
we've been talking all about money and financial returns
in this discussion,
but what's one non-money related investment
that you would encourage folks to consider adopting
in their lives?
Real quick before we get to that, folks,
if you've enjoyed having Steven on here, time got short.
There's still a lot I'd love to talk to him about.
If you'd like to have him back on the program again
in the future to elaborate on income investing,
please let him know by hitting the like button
then clicking on the red subscribe button below
as well as that little bell icon right next to it.
Just a reminder that the Thoughtful Money Spring Conference
is coming up very fast now
and that lowest early bird price discount
is still being offered,
but that's gonna go away at the end of the month,
which is coming up quickly.
So don't delay anymore.
If you're interested in registering for the conference,
do it now to lock in that lowest price.
And if you're a premium subscriber to our sub stack,
you get $50 off that lowest early bird price.
Another benefit that premium subscribers of the sub stack
are going to get is I wrote a piece a couple of years ago,
basically just sort of, it's a primer on income investing.
And it just basically talks about
all the major common assets,
many of which Steven talked about here,
but there are others that we didn't have a chance
to get into.
So that primer just basically sort of explains
what they all are.
I know we used a lot of terminology in this discussion
that maybe not everybody knows.
That primer does a good job of sort of explaining
what each of those things are.
I'll be sending that after this interview
to all my premium subscribers on sub stack.
So if you're interested in getting that as well,
and you're not yet a premium subscriber,
consider upgrading, it's only 15 bucks a month, folks.
And you'll get that $50 discount to the conference
I just mentioned, plus that free primer
or that primer on income investing.
And of course, all the other benefits that you get
for signing up for sub stack,
like my notes to all these interviews
and all the other benefits that the subscribers get.
All right, last, I just want to underscore again,
none of what was said in here was personal financial advice,
but I think for a lot of people,
dealing with credit and fixed income instruments,
it's a little bit more challenging initially,
just because it's a little bit more mathy for people
and a lot of people get scared by that.
And a lot of people just don't have experience
investing in these instruments.
And so, as I do every week,
I highly recommend that unless you're an experienced
DIY person yourself,
that you work under the guidance
of a good financial advisor,
professional financial advisor,
who takes into account and understands
and appreciates everything that Steven
and I talked about here.
If you've got a good one who can do that for you, great,
stick with them.
But if you don't, or you'd like to get input
from one who does, consider talking
to one of the financial advisors
that Helpful Money endorses.
These consultations that you can have with them,
they're totally free.
To sign up for one, just go to thoughtfulmoney.com,
fill out the short form there.
But like I said, they don't cost you anything.
There's no commitment to work with these guys.
It's just a free public service they offer
to help as many people as possible,
positioned as prudently as possible
in building their wealth going forward.
All right, thanks for hanging in there, Steven.
We're now here at that last question.
What's one non money related investment
you'd encourage folks to consider?
Well, it may sound fairly perfunctory to a lot of people,
but I'd say, just to build up to the answer a little bit,
I find I know so much more now.
And I'm in my mid 70s.
I know so much more now than I ever did years ago.
And I wish that I'd known it sooner, but I didn't.
And so now, one of my goals, whether it's
from an investing point of view or just living,
is to try to live as long as I can
and be healthy while I'm doing it,
so I can apply all these lessons that I've been learning
for the last 70 years, some of them really the hard way.
And I said, I come from good Italian stock,
I guess, where my grandfather Giuseppe came over
on a wooden ship in 1901 as a teenager
and worked in the slate quarries and managed
to live to be 96.
My dad went through the Second World War,
was at Iwo Jima, was married 50 odd years, some of them
not so odd, and lived in '96 too.
So I'm hoping, I've got the genes,
and I'm hoping I can do it and continue
to make some kind of a useful contribution
and enjoy myself for the next 20 years.
So it all depends on just staying healthy and keeping
your mind wide open to new ideas and everything.
So I would say that's the most important thing.
And if you're younger than I am, and most of you probably are,
start working on it now.
We live in a 55 and over community,
and I see a lot of my neighbors and others, some of whom
are younger than me.
And I don't want to pass judgment,
but I think some of them wish they had started earlier,
taking care of themselves.
And so that's the most important thing you can do.
Take care of yourselves physically, mentally,
spiritually, however you can, and it'll
help your investing and your living, I think.
Great point.
Folks know that I talk about this topic a lot here,
but invest in your functional health, both physically,
mentally, spiritually, as you said,
so that just like the horses in your analogy,
you actually finish the race.
What good is building up this whole income
engine if you clock out halfway through the race
because you didn't take good enough care of yourself?
Right.
All right, well, look, it's been a wonderful conversation.
Thanks so much for coming on and introducing-- well,
explaining all these instruments for us,
demystifying it for us, but also presenting your framework
that I think a lot of people are going to find really
interesting.
And I love bringing on practical, actionable ideas
like this, and you've done that in spades here, Stephen.
I really look forward to having you back on the program
again at some point in the future,
but thanks so much for giving us so much time.
And everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
My pleasure.
Thank you.
