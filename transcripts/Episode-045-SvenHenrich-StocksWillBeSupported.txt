Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
The bears had every opportunity to break the markets over the past few years, from a global
pandemic with a broad economic shutdown to a resulting 40 year high in inflation, followed
by the most aggressive rate hike cycle in history.
But the bears failed.
The markets are back at all time highs, and likely to power a lot higher from here if
the arc he expects plays out predicts technical analyst Sven Henrich of NorthmanTrader.com.
He knows this isn't a popular prediction amongst those skeptical of today's lofty market valuations
and Sven himself doesn't like this prediction.
He recently released a report titled The Cynic's Guide to Markets, laying out the rationale
for the sanguine market outlook, which I'll ask him to summarize for us in today's conversation.
Sven, thanks so much for joining us today.
Hi, Adam.
Great to be back with you and congrats on the new channels.
Doing great.
Thank you, brother.
And the fact that we landed Sven Henrich is going to bring it to new highs, I'm absolutely
sure.
But no, buddy, it's always great to see you.
Thank you.
We always have great discussions.
Our challenge is hacking them into a single conversation.
We're going to do our best here.
I really want to dig into your cynics guide to markets, because I know it's a message
a lot of people, myself included, kind of don't really want to hear, but it may just
be reality.
So it's an important conversation to have.
Real quick before we get to that, though, just to set the stage, what's your current
assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
Well, maybe I'll start with financial markets.
Well, I guess the quote of the week is the future is so bright, we just got to upgrade.
That was Morgan Stanley on January 30th for the banks, and of course, the financial index
dropped 6% in two days right after.
Look, we've come out of a very powerful rally, S&P up 20% since the October lows.
This followed up on actually a couple of discussions you and I had last year.
One was the main message was liquidity.
The other one was technicals, and then of course, the powers that be in the background,
and it has culminated basically as a result of just the most dramatic easing in financial
conditions we've ever seen.
And that's, by the way, one of those things in markets that we all had to contend with
in the last four years basically.
Every year we see something we've never seen before.
Remember Jay Powell in September talked about how higher yields were helping the Fed in
bringing inflation down, and then right after that, it all fell apart, and now we have basically
a bonanza for markets.
And so in principle, and this is maybe where we can pull up one chart that you and I discussed
last time, that was the one-year yield.
My position back then was to say, look, if we get through a evident peak in a cycle in
yields, that is going to be opening the door to a market runway to new highs.
The one-year yields peaked in the fall, and by the way, I should just add, this is very
important to understand as well, this was right around the time, as you guys all recall,
every Fed speaker was talking higher for longer, higher for longer, higher for longer.
And right at the beginning of October, Janet Yellen suddenly came out, and she said, higher
for longer may not necessarily be a given.
And you and I talked about last year how the Yellen factor, better pay attention to what
Yellen says.
So she went completely against the grain in terms of what the Fed was positioning.
And lo and behold, we got a massive reversal in yields just a couple of weeks later.
And what this chart, the same chart I showed last year, was basically saying, as soon as
you have that return in yields, you get a major relief rally.
It's the relief from the peak tightening.
And we've seen this in cycle after cycle after cycle.
The question always was, and is here too, if there is to be a recession, how long is
the runway?
In some cases months, in some cases years.
We don't know the answer to that.
But what I would submit to you that in context of this historic chart, everything we've seen
in markets so far is completely consistent with history.
So on that basis, there's been no surprise just on that level.
And we'll go more into technicals later, because there's other things that are developing that
are far from usual, in fact, outright bizarre.
And so in context, you get-- and we got this in 2006 as well-- you get all this soft landing
optimism and so forth.
And you are looking basically at Goldilocks data right now in terms of the economy.
Because you see solid GDP growth on paper.
You see falling inflation.
You see a reduction in yields.
You see a massive easing of financial conditions.
And so price drive sentiment, and therefore everybody's optimistic again.
Is the economy as strong as it appears?
This is-- as bullish as we've been, I am a bit concerned that we're all looking at a
rigged deck to a certain degree.
Because the reality is last year, we've seen the largest non-US recessionary deficit in
history turn out to be $2 trillion.
The dream team that put out the forecast last year, at the beginning of last year, pointed
out to a $1.5 trillion deficit.
Well, we got a $2 trillion deficit, and debt increased by $2.7 trillion.
This is a level of physical impulse you usually only see during an actual recession, when
they have to come in and rescue everything and stimulate.
Yeah, to see this in this context, you just got to recognize that this is overstating
everything.
I mean, not like we're ever going to have a balanced budget, but presume for a moment
we had a balanced budget, GDP growth wouldn't be anywhere near this.
You talked about the labor market.
You can say, well, the labor market's holding in.
Yeah, fair enough.
You can say that's basically on the surface true, and it's not in past cycles.
It's not until the labor market properly cracks that something bad happens.
But who's doing the hiring here?
In fact, I had pulled up a chart a while-- this was last week, I think.
I was looking at the labor force in general.
And it's the civilian labor force, it's the government labor force, right?
The government hiring.
I mean, half the jobs for the last couple of years have come from government hiring.
And we just saw a 700,000 people drop in the civilian labor force in December, which I
found interesting.
Well, government hiring continues to roll up, right?
And so in fact, the civilian labor force is now below where it was last August, which
I kind of found surprising.
So there's these counter forces where I say, OK, what's the real story here?
But then I ask these questions, and I also have to ask the next question, which is, does
it matter?
If you have-- and this is the experiment.
This is maybe where now we go and be off into the bit unusual here, because we've never
seen this before, this type of fiscal impulse in a non-recessionary environment.
Is that so dominating that it will actually mask over any potential lag effect issues
you may still have?
I don't know the answer to that.
And be clear, they're not stopping this year.
They may talk about maybe having lower funding requirements this year, but the CBO just came
out this week, and their forecast is for $1.6 trillion deficit again this year.
And of course, if you get any surprises, that's going right back up to $2 trillion.
So this fiscal impulse part is still with us.
And so from that perspective, you can argue maybe, all right, maybe let's just keep this
going.
And whatever negatives there may be will be overshadowed by this behemoth of spending
that continues to roll throughout the economy.
Having said all of that, I think you guys all just noticed that in recent days, the
payoff announcements come rolling in by the tens of thousands.
In fact, on some levels, between 80,000, 90,000, depends on how you count that for the month
of January.
It's quite an uptick from what we've seen in the latter part of 2023.
And the reason for that, I think that's very important to note as well, is companies had
greatly benefited from all the inflation, because inflation was a great way for companies
to pass on higher prices to consumers, and that cranked up the profit margins.
But guess what?
Inflation has been coming down, and now you have the counter effect, and you've got pressure
on profit margins, and what you're going to do is you're going to cut fat, which means
you're going to lay off employees.
Right sizing, they called it back in the day.
And so, okay, so now you're going to have more and more people become unemployed.
Is it systemic at this point where you have to be concerned that all of a sudden the entire
economy cracks?
No, not yet.
This can go on for months, and it's only at the point when this becomes more systemic
and you see companies across the board lay off in major amounts that all of a sudden
this will then impact classic retail spending as people have to type in their belts.
So from that perspective, we're looking at officially fantastic data.
The party can keep rolling.
The deficit keeps on rolling.
There are some warning signs in terms of slowing.
But hey, even just now before we started recording, I saw the Atlanta Fed coming out, and they're
coming out.
They just cranked up their Q1 GDP forecast from 3.5% or 3% to over 4.2%, just like that.
Great job slowing things down.
Looks like we keep accelerating on the growth front, which is what you would expect from
record loosening of financial conditions.
So I mixed up the market and the economy a little bit, but there is a larger market message.
This rally here has, on one hand, not surprised from the technical perspective, but its makeup
is very unusual, and we can discuss that in a bit as well.
And I had this week in a new video flagged out a few warning signs that have me a bit
cautionary here.
OK.
Great intro.
So many things I want to dig into.
Again, the long arc here of the discussion is we want to get to your cynics guide.
So even though we're going to take a little bit of an indirect route there, we are going
to get there, folks.
OK.
I've got a number of things here.
I guess the first one, you talked about things playing out like they have in history so far.
When yields peak, and I'll see if I can bring up that chart again in just a second, when
the Fed hikes the discount rate and then stops and then begins to cut, that's typically when
we enter a recession, or at least when we've entered recessions recently.
That has been the precedent pattern.
Got to differentiate here because I call it two phases.
The first phase is yield relief.
That gives you the market runway, yields.
The market party is right, it hears, oh, they're done, awesome.
Yeah.
Awesome.
Everything is cool, the worst is over, blah, blah, blah.
It is then at the point where dropping, there is a point where dropping yields are no longer
reflecting the relief part, but they're actually reflecting an economy that is slowing down
dramatically.
Right.
And it's usually the Fed is behind the curve and they're like, oh my gosh, we tightened
too much or for too long and now we're going to cut like crazy.
Yeah.
That's the typical lag effect part of it.
And then yield relief turns into yield terror.
And typically that's what happens when the yield curves uninvert back to positive.
Right.
Which they've been creeping in that direction, right?
Creeping in that direction, but the big ones haven't crossed yet and need to basically
across the spectrum.
So from that perspective, the runway still exists and markets can still move higher.
It's when you see, and by the way, this is why it's kind of interesting yesterday because
we saw yields drop and markets drop with it, but today yields drop lower and the markets
bounce back up, right?
So this tit for tat game still continues.
You need to see evidence of an actual shift in the dynamics.
I don't think we've got anything confirmed on that front yet.
Okay.
So I'm just pulling the chart up here just so folks can see.
We don't have recessions shaded on this chart, but you'll see this pattern of rise in interest
rates than a peak and a plateau, and then they plummet and you see that before the dot
com bust, you see that before the great financial crisis.
You see it in 2019 and we ended up having a recession triggered by the pandemic, but
a lot of people, I think even yourself included Sven, I think we probably would have had a
recession even without the pandemic.
It would have been some other trigger.
And then now we were up at the apex here.
What's kind of interesting is these previous ones generally had sort of a bit of a plateau
where rates kind of hung out for a quarter or two.
Not in 95, not in 95, right?
Or in, was it 89?
You're right.
Earlier they're more peaky.
I think we're back to peak here.
So all I want to say here is I'm going to connect a couple of dots.
So we've had people on the program before, like Darius Dale, who has looked at similar
charts and said, hey, the markets tend to party their hardest right up until the wheels
come off there.
We talk about it, how the party gets its most raging right before the cops show up, right?
So that party into the recession is sort of like what you're talking about here, Sven,
where OK, Fed announced that it's done hiking and they're now talking about cutting.
You get this sort of relief rally going on.
Seems to be what's happening now.
Now TBD, if this is going to follow the script that the previous cycles have, because you're
raising a really important question here, which is, hey, yeah, normally we would expect
the lag effects from all of that hiking and the quantitative tightening and everything
to catch up with us, but we've had this massive wave of liquidity, including all this tremendous
fiscal spending.
So your question, which I think is a very valid one, is, will that overwhelm the lag
effect this time?
And maybe that'll just give a nice kind of permanent runway to this party to happen,
right?
So I'm reminded of the Teitler quote that said that democracies can exist up until the
point where the public realizes it can vote itself largesse from the treasury.
To me, it almost feels like the government has realized that it can vote itself largesse
from the treasury, where the government is now just spending like a drunken sailor to
keep the party going.
My question is, can they stop it politically, ever?
In other words, think of a program like Obamacare, and I don't want to say, or the affordable
health care.
I don't want to say it's good or it's bad, but I remember hearing at the time that the
strategy was, let's expand health care coverage for all these people that weren't covered.
And then it's going to be just so politically unpopular to ever take that away.
So now that the government is out there basically spending as extremely as it is, is there anybody,
new president, new Fed chair, whatever, who can step in and say, you know what, we're
going to start switching to austerity and we're going to have to start tightening our
belts here.
I wonder if the horse is out of the barn on this one and they politically really can't
stop it.
Well, I have a few comments on that.
Yeah.
I've never known you not to have a strong goose.
Just everybody's clear.
We live in an age where last year with a straight face, the treasury secretary went in front
of Congress and presented a fiscal responsibility act that called for $2 trillion deficits as
far as the eye can see.
And it was passed and ever since any government shutdown, whatever, every time the can gets
kicked.
In fact...
Just to interject, to be clear, we don't have a debt ceiling limit at this point in time.
No, we don't.
That's kicked into 2025.
I have a question for you, Adam.
How many nights of sleep have you lost since the U.S. debt has hit $20 trillion?
I worry about it a lot.
I don't know if that's the answer you're looking for, but I do worry about it a lot.
I'm just asking because Janet Yellen in December 2017 says $20 trillion debt should keep every
one awake at night.
In 2018, in January, she said the deficits are not sustainable.
This was at the time debt $20 trillion.
Interest payments on debt were $500 billion, not even quite, but like $450.
And now just a few years later, we're sitting at $34 trillion going on $35 trillion pretty
much in the next quarter, who knows.
And interest in debt has more than doubled now over $1 trillion and there's no end in
sight.
What has changed?
Is it just political posturing?
Because now Janet Yellen is overseeing all this, but it's parallel to the same thing.
They all been saying these things for years.
These are not internet bears that are complaining about the debt.
That was the head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, and now Jay Powell saying these
things.
And all of a sudden, now we're in this phase where, okay, you know what?
And fair enough.
When I first saw them going into rate hikes, into the highest debt construct ever, my view
was something's going to break.
Guess what?
Nothing's broken.
And the fact that nothing is broken and they're going to continue on this path because there's
no way out to your point, there actually is no way out.
They're completely trapped by this construct now.
Maybe 10, 15 years ago, you could have said, okay, let's do some austerity.
Let's try to be disciplined and we'll just take the pain.
Maybe you could have done that back then, but I think it's gotten so large, so big as
part of the economy.
I mean, interest rates alone are bigger than now the entire U.S. military budget.
And guess what?
$1 trillion is just going to be the beginning part of this.
This is going to go to $2, $3 trillion.
It's going to blow out the entire discretionary U.S. budget of the U.S. It's insane.
And so you got to keep wondering how is this all going to get funded ultimately.
And it's not just the numbers that have been taken on, it's the maturities of the previous
debt that had been financed during the low interest rate area.
Because we're going to see trillions of dollars in maturities coming due this year and next
year.
And they're going to have to be refinance at much higher rates.
So yes, myself and a lot of people have been wondering for a long time, how is this math
going to actually work?
And well, Janet Yellen has an answer.
She said, don't worry about it.
It's fine.
The same person that said to lose sleep at night over $20 trillion.
Yeah.
I don't want to be sensational about this, but is this like the captain kind of ordering
the waitstaff to bring out the good champagne and caviar on the Titanic just to keep people
calm and distracted while he's trying to figure out how the heck do we deal with this water
that's rushing in?
I would love to see a podcast of Janet Yellen in 2017 talking to the Janet Yellen in 2024.
I'd be really curious to see how that conversation would go.
Now, I mean, it is a real reality.
And by the way, this reality has mattered to market participants in the last few months.
I go back to when I said the Fed's staying higher for longer, higher for longer, out
comes Janet Yellen saying it's not necessarily a given.
But it's not an accident that she is saying that because of the mathematics of it all.
She as a treasury secretary has a real need to see lower interest rates coming and coming
fast because they're going to run into a wall where the size of the interest payments alone
will just choke out all growth because they're going to be so constrained by that.
So she really needs lower rates.
And that's why when I was watching this show between higher for longer and not higher for
longer, you got to wonder who's really in charge of everything.
And then fast forward from October to December, Jay Powell coming out and saying it's way
too soon to talk about rate cuts.
And 12 days later, he goes, we talked about the rate cuts.
OK, so what happened in those 12 days?
Does that maybe reveal who's stronger in this battle?
Yeah, I think absolutely.
I think, look, the reality is the way that this was managed with reverse repo and the
funding requirements was pretty clear that Janet Yellen was willing to take on higher
interest payments in order to avoid going through reverse repo.
So basically, she helped fuel a bunch of liquidity into the market, which helped to using financial
conditions.
And when you saw that massive drop in loosening of financial conditions in the lead up to
the December Fed meeting, you would have thought Powell would stand up and say, hey, in terms
of our inflation mission, this is not what we want to see.
Instead, he doubled on down, causing even further easing in financial conditions and
lighting the rally even further on fire.
And that made very little sense on paper.
So look, I didn't bring my tinfoil hat here, but you got to look for the messaging and
what happens after the messaging and especially who is messaging and when.
And it's pretty clear to me that given the math realities that there are big, big powers
at play that need to manage this without blowing things up.
And that's why I think, if you look at the yearly chart, for example, that I brought
along on the S&P, this is a chart you and I discussed last year.
And as you said in the outset, look, we had a global pandemic.
We had the highest inflation of 40 years and we had the most aggressive rate hike cycle
and what broke nothing.
I mean, that little, that COVID crash looks like a little dip.
This is by the way, if you look at the EMA that a five EMA is the exponential moving
average and it's one of those super long-term charts that basically tells you, okay, when
are you not actually structured bear market and when you're just having a little corrective
move.
And COVID crash global pandemic, it totally fell below and we all know what happened and
it just got printed away by the end of the year, closed far above it.
So it never happened.
And then of course we had continued printing into the top of the long-term trend line from
the 1920s, imagine that, and then 22, all 22 was, was a dip back at the yearly five
EMA.
And by the way, that dip to the yearly five EMA, it's moved up since, but that was precisely
the moment Janet Yellen came out and said she was concerned about liquidity in the treasury
market and that was it.
And last year we had at the beginning of the year, March banking crisis, little selling
at the beginning of the year, that was the tag then.
And of course Yellen was concerned and that was it.
So I'm just looking at control and I'm looking at this in terms of who's in charge here.
And you just got to objectively look at this and say, what?
Nothing has happened.
It was basically an ongoing bull market fueled by money.
When they didn't have to remove the money spigot a little bit, they let it happen to
a certain degree.
And then every time the market was this close to breaking, they flipped the switch.
And last year, basically when you, if you want to view it through the lens of the official
monetary tightening process, there was no monetary tightening last year on a net basis.
Yeah, the balance sheet rolled off, but by the way, this is very different to QE.
When during QT, you have a passive rollover.
It's not like that they're actively dumping assets.
It's passive.
They just roll off the balance sheet.
What happened was with the BTFP bank rescue program with bank reserves, and by the way,
during that initial rescue, they obviously expanded the balance sheet again before starting
the passive rollover again.
Those were maybe the lessons from 2008 that they applied, which is you don't wait until
things break.
You start intervening right at the moment when they look like they're breaking or could
be breaking.
And so on that basis, you just got to look at this objectively and say, okay, who's in
control?
Well, bulls are in control.
That's reality, and bears with every excuse in the book, couldn't break anything.
Sorry to say.
And now we're way above the yearly five EMA again, and maybe you get lucky and you got
another attack this year, but it's not until you break that thing and stay below it for
at least the second year.
And it just hasn't happened since, guess what?
Early 2000.
I should say the financial crisis, we had one big red candle in 2008, and we all know
what happened in March of 2009, big old intervention again, and that was the end of it.
We all look at things in daily, weekly timeframes, but if you look at the big picture, it's pretty
clear who's in control at this point for sure.
So the question I have maybe philosophically is to say, if you can't break the market with
a global pandemic record inflation and a record tightening cycle, what's it going to take?
I think that's a great question.
And undeniably looking at this chart here, yeah, the bulls have had the preponderance
of the winds here.
I'm curious, we see the EMA line, it's getting up near the high end of this range.
And when we've seen that happen in the past, it has come off a bit or gone sideways for
some prolonged period of time.
Do you expect that to happen here again, or could we potentially punch above this long-term
channels upward limit here into kind of unknown territory?
Well, in terms of the pink line on top, this is actually farther than it seems, but you
can make the case around 5,400, 5,500 for this year, and obviously it's rising in terms
of the yearly 5 EMA, I would simply say you get a reconnect in most years, and then it's
either support or it falls through.
But in most cases, it's support as we just seen in the last three years again, you can
even make the case it held obviously during COVID even though it temporarily pierced it.
But a tag is not a requirement either.
You may see some years where it doesn't tag it, in the early '90s, for example, or even
a couple of times in other decades.
In most cases, you see a reconnect.
And so maybe that's a potential event happening, and we can talk about 2024 and from a strategic
perspective into 2025, what maybe to expect there.
But at the moment, we're pretty sizably disconnected from it, and at some point we may approach
it because I don't expect '24 to be all smooth sailing either.
Okay.
And that's perhaps a good entree into your cynics guide to markets.
So I want to let you talk about it in any way you want to.
The kind of key "too long, didn't read" summary I took away from it was you think that 2024
could be a bumpy ride, but what you're more confident about is that if we do have any
real weakness, particularly in the economy, that the response to that is going to be overwhelming,
and that that would then likely ignite a very strong market rally, say perhaps in the 2025
or whatnot, depending upon, obviously, when that breakage might happen.
Did I get the crib notes right?
Yeah.
I mean, look, given what I just outlined, I actually hate it.
I'm talking a position that I actually hate to be supportive of in a way, because I'm
not supportive of it, but basically this is where the cynic comes in.
By the way, if you remember good old George Carlin, if you scratch a cynic, you'll find
a disappointed idealist.
And maybe that's part of what's going on here, because I would love free markets and I would
love proper price discovery, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
But as we've seen again, everything got crushed and saved.
I just have to be extremely practical about the control pivots and where they are and
what's happening behind the scenes, unfortunately.
Now the cynics guy basically first acknowledges all the bullish structures from liquidity
to historic yield turns to the relief runway have led to the rally that we talked about
last year into this year.
But now the setup technically, and that's based on a number of factors.
One is technically, the other one is historical, and the third one is actually seasonal.
We aren't in a presidential election year.
They have their own seasonal quirks, if you will, which calls for initial chop in kind
of the first quarter, if you will, with intermittent new highs on the year.
I would argue that so far, that's exactly what we've seen.
We saw intermittent new highs, we saw chop, and we'll talk about what's happening underneath
in this main indices in a bit as well, because that's really critical as well.
But it says it's kind of going to linger along for the rest of the year.
There's going to be some more corrective activity and then guess what, yet another rally into
the end of the year, because that seems to be the standard script.
I could argue that maybe this year has potential for more political volatility, because here
too we're facing a very unprecedented type of presidential election.
And none of us have a clue how that's going to turn out, no doubt.
But there's always flip side, there's flip side for risk or big relief rally or it's
a big nothing burger.
So that's all to be determined.
But what's interesting to me, and I just realized that late last year and then I put in some
more thoughts into that during the cynics guide of markets, and I saw a 10 year cycle
chart on the S&P and it was kind of fascinating to me because I never looked at markets in
this context.
Again, much, much bigger timeframe, and it had a certain flow to it with basically just
a glaring big rip into year five.
And I said to myself, well, maybe that's driven by a couple of years or what have you.
But no, I went back and I looked at every single decade since 1900, every single one
of them.
I have the article on my website, you can see it there.
I actually think it's still my pin tweet.
Things can always change.
Things can always be varied and what have you in all these decades, obviously tremendous
events happen, recessions happen, crises happen, wars happen, you name it.
And what all of these things say, every single one of them, is no matter what happens in
year four, whether it's a stable, bullish year, or whether it's a really choppy year,
or if it's even a bearish year, which has happened a couple of times in these fourth
years, but no matter what happens, the fifth year is up.
Show me one fifth year in a decade that's not been up, you can't, because they all have
been up.
I mean, not even an exception, really, that's incredible.
And what it also says is that then trouble starts brewing in the latter part of the decade.
And you may still have them like in year seven and year eight, and then you may have a big
rally in year nine, and then you have trouble in the beginning part of the decade.
But you don't need to go back to 1900 to get a sense that actually we've just all experienced
that.
I mean, after all, what was 1999, it was a big up year.
What was the first couple of years in 2000?
It was a recession, it was trouble.
Guess what 2015 was, it was an up year, I mean, 2005, that was an up year.
When did the trouble happen?
Seventh and eighth year.
We peaked in 2007, we had the crisis in eight, and guess what?
Even though year nine, 2009 started down, it ripped up.
We did have some corrective activity in 2011, 2012, 2015 was up.
Guess what?
2018, down year, right?
What was 2019, the ninth year?
Back up.
And then what happened at the beginning of the decade, COVID crash.
And 2022 was a down year, right?
And what did the cycle chart say?
2003, it starts all heading back up.
In the fourth year, it says a bunch of chop, up, down, up, down, new highs, and then rip
into year five.
So surprise me, take it for what you want.
I have these charts on my pin tweet in that article, you can look at every single decade.
And so you're saying that is an unbroken track record for the past century?
That's the one thing that seems to be a guarantee.
Now, me having pointed this out may make this all invalid, totally valid, but I find that
to be the most fascinating thing.
So there have been a couple of fourth years that were terrible, like 1974 oil crisis,
but 1973 was already a bear market, right?
Because we're not in a bear market right now.
So there were a couple of exceptions.
We definitely struggled in the fourth year.
In fact, even in 2004, you had the strong start, by the way, that was also a presidential
election year, 2004, I believe.
There was a lot of back and forth chop.
There was even a new low in the summer of that year, but not below the October lows
of 2003.
And then just retire.
And then of course, 2005, the rest is history.
Basically what it says, what have we said earlier is that whatever happens in 2024,
that pattern structure, that history that so far has 100% track record says whatever
low you get, you buy into 2024.
In your four.
All right.
And we can debate what that low may be.
I have no idea, right?
I mean, there's all kinds of possibilities I'm looking at, but I think it is weird to
think that markets have reacted in a very consistent manner over the course, over a
hundred years in each decade.
And that's the world you live in, where you're a guy who looks at patterns, right?
So I do want to give note to the folks I've had on the channel recently who have a very
short term focus.
So these tend to be folks that have a trading model and the headlight of their trading model
goes out a month or three months or whatever.
And they have been saying for the past month or so, all indicators are green, right?
And the market has been rewarding that.
But then also when we look at people who have a much longer view, so one that would share
the arc that you just mentioned there, Sven, is Michael Howell, who his work very much
focuses on liquidity.
He thinks that liquidity is going to keep going, keep rising from here.
He says it's going to be a rising tide for the next two years.
So he expects both the economy and the markets to do very well between now and two years
from now.
Again, nothing goes in a straight line, but he's got a lot of confidence.
It's going to be a lot higher in two years from now than it is now, which your projection
would say.
And Michael is, I would put him in the bull camp.
What's interesting is I would put some of the bears that I've had on this channel into the
same camp.
And so we look at a guy like Felix Zulauf, who I would say Sven, I think his macro thoughts
are quite similar to yours in terms of the concerns and whatnot.
He says we're in the era of the roller coasters where we're going to see these market breakages
and then moonshots as the stimulus keeps getting bigger and bigger every time.
And looking at it this year, when I interviewed him a month ago, he said he believed that
the markets were going to do really well in Q1.
He believed the economy was going to surprise everybody to the upside.
But he didn't think that these were really sustainable growth that was pushing the economy.
And so he expects the downside of the roller coaster this year with, we hit an all time
high say at some point around the end of Q1 and then it falls, the market falls through
the rest of the year, perhaps falling pretty substantially.
But then like you, he expects a big central plan or rescue and markets to hit all time
new highs by a long shot in 2025.
Again, not for good fundamental reasons, just because of they're being juiced by all of
this rescue stimulus.
So I just want to sort of connect these dots from different people we've had on the channel.
Even though you don't love what you're saying, I think your arc is to a certain extent supported
by other people.
Some of whom are using different methodologies or looking through different lenses, but still
coming to the same conclusion.
Yeah, I mean, look, the deciding factor last year was simply liquidity.
We had that tightening move here.
Everybody was talking about, oh, M2 growth is negative and that means the end of the
world.
If you look at M2 in absolute terms, it barely budged off from the post COVID highs.
I mean, it was a very minute reduction.
And if you look at it in terms of year over year, it actually increased since the banking
crisis last March in terms of the trajectory.
So all the indicators were back north and we see equity prices basically following suit
there.
And again, if something bad were to happen in '24 and you get some sort of scarecrow
moment, you just know this is the most awesome firepower, potential firepower the Fed has
had in many, many, many years, 5.33% Fed funds rate.
See a crisis, they popped up to zero in a heartbeat and QE, again, COVID, we've seen
what this all can do.
Now having said all this and talking about markets in context of this four year cycle
and choppiness and so forth, I want to dig a little bit into some of the technicals for
a moment because there's one chart I want to show you, which is the strongest sector
we all know, technology, NDX, I have a monthly chart of NDX, I find interesting is one of
those charts that says, okay, maybe I want to be a little bit cautious right now.
Little bit of context, first of all, I have not adjusted these trend lines in at least
a couple of years ever.
I mean, COVID crash created a new trend line in 2020 for my perspective, these trend lines
have been in place for years and it was interesting when in, if you look at the NDX, they're in
the middle of 2020 when they saved, but right before the COVID crash, NDX hit that center
trend line again, perfectly, right and they rejected from there and it bottomed at this
new trend line that was created and then we got the stimulus and then it ripped above
that trend line, that center trend line and if you look closely, you can see then there
was a little back test of it in kind of the fall of 2020, that was these two little corrections
that just back tested it and it just ripped higher into the top of 2022 and the 2022 top
actually coincided with a long-term trend back to 2006.
And the reason I mention this is because these big, big picture trend lines for some reason,
I can't tell you why the market tends to respect them in a big way.
In fact, when we had the big tightening move there in 2022, what you can see is and I talked
about this last year at the end of 2022, beginning of 2023, is how precisely NDX kept tagging
that new uptrend line that was created with the COVID crash.
I mean, ding, ding, ding, that's what I said, you know, controlled bear market, we talked
about it at the time, it just held every single time, it was amazing and in the process of
all of this, it kind of created this really steep falling wedge and if you see at the
bottom of the chart, that was new highs, new lows, that was like the most blood sea of
red we'd seen since the global financial crisis.
So you see the most intensive selling since the financial crisis and you can't break the
trend and you got a bullish falling wedge, what does that tell you?
That tells you big rally is coming, right?
I mean, that was the case then and then we had this big rip up and then in the fall,
basically all it did is build a bull flag and then rip right back to this trend line.
Guess what?
We just hit it this week, January 31st, hit it perfectly and reject it.
Wow.
I mean, just as a technician, I go, wow, this stuff still has relevance, you know.
Now, does that mean end of the line and everything falls apart?
I can't say that.
Is it making the case for maybe a corrective case?
Yeah.
In fact, if you look back at the low end of it, what's kind of disturbing here is despite
how powerful this rally has been, the new highs and the new lows on NDX have not expanded.
In fact, they've gotten weaker since last year.
I mean, in January, look, I mean, this is a monthly chart obviously, but look at the
close of the month, there's nothing there and it speaks to the awesome thinning of this
market that we're all aware of with the Mac 7s.
The market cap expansion that we've seen in some of these stocks have been not only historic
in terms of size and velocity, but they're just absolutely stunning and it's concerning.
In fact, over the holidays, I ran into a multi-decade money manager here in the UK, very, very calm,
very rational, intelligent guy, he's been in the business for a very long, long time.
And we were talking markets a little bit, a little bit sharp talking, and he expressed
to me as an asset manager, fund manager, how on the one hand, he's very concerned about
the thinning of the market, but on the other hand, it also has a real life implication
for him.
And that one is broad and it's very real for the entire industry.
He has long-term clients that love him to death.
And they say, you know, you're a great guy, you do great work, but why am I paying you?
You do all this work and all this analysis and you're lagging the index.
Because unless, if you are, remember the old RHT, you want to be diversified in risk management
and all this, if you're truly diversified in this market, you're lagging the index because
the power of the few is so dominating.
Like tonight, we got three stocks reporting, right, Amazon, Apple, and Meta.
That's five and a half trillion dollars in two stocks.
Ten stocks, 50% of the QQQ.
It's super thin in terms of the leadership.
So these guys are in a terrible position because on the one hand they get pressure, because
how do I catch up?
And then they have to engage in chasing.
We saw this again at the end of 2023.
The reason we get these year-end rallies, they have to chase, they have to chase, they
have to chase.
They have no choice.
Sorry to interrupt, but it's not just chasing.
It's like having a sword point at your back.
I think most of them don't want to do it.
On the fundamental level, they're just like, I don't believe these companies have the upside
ahead that their valuation suggests.
But to your point, they've got like a professional spear at their back that says, hey, if you
want to stay in business, you got to do this.
Yeah.
And so you then create behavior.
I mean, behavior scientists can probably look at this, but you're creating behavior that's
completely disconnected from anything fundamental because it becomes a mechanical game in how
to position and how to, you know, be forced basically to maintain your job in one way
or another.
Right.
And certainly your point, but it's like that I had to burn the village to save it.
It's like I had to breach my fiduciary duty to my clients to do what they wanted me to
do.
Well, it's interesting because that's exactly what happened into year-end.
They chased everything up.
And then at the beginning of January, they immediately sold out because I'm guessing
they were probably imbalanced in terms of what the mandate may be.
So they sold out.
You saw the first week dip in January and then guess what?
Markets went back up on the heels of the few and they were forced to chase again.
But now they haven't, again, allocated the same aggressive level as the end of 2023.
So that by math implication means they're lagging again.
Right.
It's one of those things.
And this is actually why I want to show just a mind-blowing chart.
You know, everybody talks about equal weight and this, that and the other.
There's a chart I've been tracking for years.
It's called XVG.
It's the Value Line Geometric Index.
Let me explain what that means.
What it does, what this indicator does basically says, we're taking, I think it's based on
1600 stocks and we assign the same value to them.
They're all worth $100.
And then we measure how they move relative to each other as price changes.
So it kind of gives you, it's, you know, all the indices have basically a market cap weighting
hacker to it, meaning, you know, Apple has a greater influence than a stock that is worth,
you know, $10 billion in market cap vis-a-vis $3 trillion.
So obviously then you look at the S&P or the NASDAQ 100 and you see how these indices rip
to new high.
It's maybe a different way of looking at equal weight.
And there's a couple of really interesting things I want to highlight.
The first part, it's not the blue boxes, I'll get to them.
It's the right half of the chart and which basically says is this broad index in 1600
stocks in the market has been in a very contained range since basically Russia invaded Ukraine,
right?
That's when we fell down and we've been in this chop range for the better part of almost
two years.
And the bottom pink line, if you look to the left, that was resistance in the beginning
of 2020 after the COVID crash.
It was key support in October of 2022, it held, and it was a support again in October
of 2023.
Because as you recall, you know, a lot of indices were lagging up until that point last
year.
And hence, by the way, that chart was a screaming buy on the daily version.
We had a really nice positive divergence and it again hit that key support.
And what we saw, it ripped higher brutally into the end of the year.
That was the big rally.
But first point to note here, just actually fascinating to me, is that that rally in XVG
again stopped dead in its tracks at the top pink line, the resistance line.
I mean, just perfect.
It's like, wow, it mattered again.
So from a philosophical point of view, I would just say argue with everyone, and not argue,
but suppose to everyone that for me to see a really confirmed new bull market, you would
want XVG to cross above that line.
And by the way, I was in vacation the tail end of the year, and when I came back and
looked at this chart, I was actually surprised it had not crossed.
I would have expected it to cross because all of a sudden everything was rallying, right?
Small caps, everybody was talking about the big catch-up trade, blah, blah, blah.
It hasn't crossed.
So I'm a little bit baffled.
And now it gets even more interesting.
You noticed that the S&P obviously last week, this week, made new all-time highs, all-time
record highs.
On the bottom, you see the S&P, while XVG after that first dip in January did not make
a new high.
It made a lower high.
That's a negative divergence.
That's a red flag.
And this is why I bring in the other blue boxes, because ironically, we saw the same
behavior in the lead up to the 2022 top.
If you can see at the top or at the bottom, you see S&P making new highs, but XVG did
not.
It made a lower high, negative divergence.
If you go back to pre-COVID crash, the bottom S&P makes new high into February, right?
Everybody ignored COVID and XVG did not, it made a lower high.
Now, obviously, I'm not calling for a crash here or anything like that, but I'm noting
that in the last few years, that behavior has been troublesome.
It would at least suggest there's now some sort of risk of a pullback/correction tied
back to what we just saw with the NDX, the strongest index hitting a key multi-decade
trend line, I would say in a given everything that has happened and how strong this rally
has been, that kind of makes sense to me.
But I have to say also, and this is the other thing that's absolutely baffling here, the
fact that S&P and NASDAQ and Dow made new all-time highs, but XVG continues to be stuck
in this box so much lower below previous all-time highs, that is reflective of maybe that really
two-sided economy.
Because if you look at utilities, you look at transport, small caps I mentioned and so
forth, they are not anywhere near all-time highs and they're not doing really well.
So you have party headlines on the main indices, but what lurks beneath is pretty dark.
So I'm a bit concerned about that, I have to say, and I'm obviously curious how this
plays out and which transitions me now to, we've seen things that are normal, like yields
turning and that being peak of the hot tightening cycle and therefore that's relief.
We see some unusual behavior obviously in construct of the economy and the deficit.
And then look at this chart, I'm overtly transversing into the bizarre and I'll give you one specific
example on BPSBX, it's one of those classic signal charts that we track on a regular basis
because it's on the RSI and kind of gives you a sense when things get cooked on the
overbought side and when it gets oversold on the bottom side.
And sometimes you have these nifty little divergences you can pick out, for example,
I put in here the one that we had in the fall correction here from September or October,
this was a classic buy signal.
Because the BPSBX in the center of the chart made a new low, but the RSI on top did not.
That's a positive divergence.
And then we saw this massive rip back to overbought.
And two things happened here.
So first of all, the rally was so powerful that the RSI on top got to 90.
I've seen that a couple of times in 8, 9, 10 years, a couple of times.
The usual market script for something like this, like 2018 or what have you, is that
then there is a pullback.
And then if you look for some sort of topping signal, you would then wait for a new high
on BPSBX, basically the polar opposite of the positive divergence at the low and look
for a negative one where the RSI goes to like 70, 75, makes a lower high vis-a-vis a new
high on BPSBX.
That's kind of my expectation.
When I saw that 90 reading, I said, that's okay, but I can always see where this is going.
So I thought, what?
What I see here, I've never seen before.
I mean, I've seen a lot in markets and sometimes things surprise me, but this one blows my
mind because in this last week, S&P, new high every day, new all-time high, new all-time
high, new all-time high.
And I look at that RSI on top, it's not even ticking up.
It's not moving.
What is that about?
Because usually you see it moving up.
You look at the history of that chart.
When you have a rally, especially to new highs, it's kicking up.
It's not kicking up.
And that just tells me that there is a lot of selling underneath this market that is
masked by the indices, the main indices that make new all-time highs driven by a few stocks,
which now brings us to a really bizarre conclusion because with XVG, I can make the case, oh,
everything is just about to be horrible.
But now looking at a chart that says, this is almost oversold, even that we just had
one down day of all-time highs on the Dow, right?
And I'm going to extend this chart to the next chart, which is the nice even.
That's one of those big weekly oscillated charts I like looking at because it kind of
gives me a really good sense when markets are really fried on the downside when they're
setting up for a rally or when they're getting cooked to the upside, and maybe it's time
to reduce exposure and all that stuff.
That black line that kind of oscillates up and down, hence it's called an oscillator,
kind of gives you a sense for what is regular market rhythm.
And first thing you've got to notice here, so we just made new all-time highs multiple
times in the last two weeks, and this thing is almost max oversold.
That's stochastic.
It's almost as oversold as it was at the October lows.
And we're looking at this and saying, are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
That's not normal.
And usually when you look at these bottom signals on the oscillator, you can see it
yourself on the chart, that's usually the result of markets having pulled back probably
at least a couple of weeks, maybe three, and you can be in the midst of a big correction.
See that time and time and time again, happens several times a year, right?
Sometimes it gets to max oversold, sometimes it doesn't.
There's only one time where I can say markets made new all-time highs and this thing has
been kicking to oversold.
And that was right before the COVID crash again.
Don't ask me why.
You can see that vertical blue line I tagged in, we had this initial high or this all-time
high into the end of the year and we had a dip, I think it was a January correction.
The NICI indicator itself, that's the blue and red candlestick movement corrected a little
bit and then S&P made a new all-time high on the lower read, basically the same level
as it's doing now.
And the stochastic was nearly max oversold.
That was before the crash.
It wasn't oversold after the, I mean, it was obviously more oversold after the crash.
I'm just saying we're watching a chart that has a many, many year track record of acting
in a certain rhythm and now it's behaving very unusually.
And the only precedent I have for that acting this weirdly was before the COVID crash.
Again, I'm not calling for a crash.
I'm just saying there's some really odd things going on in the charts that have me baffled.
And you can take these two things in two different ways and say, well, because COVID was an event
and something happened, it turned out to be a massive bull trap and we got the crash.
Fine.
You can take that interpretation.
But the flip side to this, I'm just telling you straight, where I feel analytically challenged
to flip side to this is to say, well, maybe while the indices are making new all-time
highs day after day after day, the broader market is correcting significantly underneath
and it becomes ever more oversold.
And that means any dip you get may be extremely shallow and then this thing can really fly
to the upside.
So that's, I guess, the mystery of discovery that we have ahead of us.
And if liquidity has anything to do with it, then of course, I would be curious to see
what happens now that they're going to remove BTFP in March and what happens with the reverse
repo facility because all of these have been great incremental contributors to liquidity.
As I said earlier, the fourth year tends to be choppy, presidential election years tend
to have weakness in the first quarter.
So maybe this all coincides with some sort of weakness into March.
But then if I look at charts like this, let's say we get weakness into February, March,
then these kind of charts already tell me we're going to be oversold very quickly.
The question then becomes how much downside are you going to get?
Basically it's already setting up for a buy.
That's kind of the message here unless something breaks and then of course then we have something
else to deal with.
What I'm trying to tell you is that while part of the rally has been completely rational
and it's been driven by factors that support that rally, it's now morphed into some really
odd behavior on the signal front that's a bit head-scratching and in the past has produced
sizable corrective activity basically.
Okay.
So I've written a lot of notes while you were talking there.
I'll get to my last one here, which is I take from the preponderance of this Sven that you're
kind of nervous about the market right now that you see potentially a good deal of reasons
for why some sort of correction, who knows how prolonged or deep it would be, but that
could happen this year.
And you've already said earlier, you sort of expect turbulence volatility this year,
something eventually that probably will spark intervention at some point later this year,
which would make 2025 maybe be a really bonanza year for the markets.
Am I accurate in saying that you're kind of nervous right now?
I'm relaxed.
I told this to our clients as well.
I'm trying to be as practical as possible and trying to be very tactical and opportunistic.
We had closed most of our lungs before we went on vacation, right before Christmas.
We came back, had a little bit left, and then we're looking at, okay, well, how's this market
in play?
And we walked straight into the first dip in weeks, right?
And just looking at the technicals, it was saying, buy.
And then we had the next dip, buy.
There were two dips.
That was basically it.
And that worked out great in January.
But now as these signals have evolved into the bizarre fashion that they have, we're
back to square one.
I mean, I have zero complaints about January, that's all great, but now I am cautious.
I'm cautious based on all these signals, on where we are in the charts.
And I don't have a swing-buy set up at this moment.
I said, we'll stay tactical until we have a swing-buy set up.
And to get a swing-buy set up, I can think of a couple of scenarios.
Now I'll share one with you, and it's totally theoretical at this point, but if you pull
up the S&P chart I sent you, my view on these things generally is, okay, I look at technicals
and if a pattern works, it works until it no longer is relevant.
And on the S&P chart, this was a chart I put out on Twitter, not this one.
Oh, not this one.
Okay, sorry.
That's the yearly.
That's not a buy set up at this point, but we may well turn it into one.
In early October, I put out this concept of the cup and handle, and we've got since copied
obviously all around.
But the point was, looking at through this whole decline in '22 and then the uptrend
decline, the COVID lows and then the low of the October '22 bottom, that weakness into
the fall, if there is to be weakness, it would set up for potential powerful cup and handle
pattern.
And when Israel invaded, or rather Hamas invaded Israel, we got a moment of sweat there.
As you recall, there was a budget concern that this could go regional again and create
a wider conflict.
But that was also the time when Janet Yellen talked about higher for longer than necessarily
a given.
Janet beats war.
And so this temporary trend break just didn't even last.
It was saved.
It was saved the next week.
So that was my moment of conviction challenging, frankly.
But again, I refer you back to that XVG chart.
It was cooked.
It was very much oversold.
And so this trend held.
And then up until this week, we had, what, 13 weeks straight up or 12 weeks straight
up out of 13 or something like that.
This is the kind of stuff bears never get, ever.
Many bulls get that straight up.
You don't get straight down.
I mean, COVID crashed three, four weeks, that's it, right?
Even though in the peak of the tightening cycle, I think six, seven weeks, that was
the unusual down move back then.
This one way fashion you just never get.
But what we got, technically objectively observe here is this pattern as plate.
It was a powerful breakout and it's just rear tire.
And structurally this chart has a room into 5,400.
Now with all the things I talked about, what would make sense to me in context of history,
seasonalities, key levels being hit and weakness underneath, what would theoretically make
sense to me is that we would see some sort of backtest.
And an outline here, a red line, which is completely theoretical, but it happens to
be that the uptrend line from the COVID crash lows in '20 and that downtrend line that was
successfully broken out of, they interject.
Guess when?
March, right during this Q1 seasonal weakness and so forth, BTFP and the next Fed meeting.
How do you convince Powell to cut rates?
Something scary happening in markets.
Look, I can't predict this, but what would in my mind, for example, be a just powerful
swing by set up with the view that this pattern structure could go to 5,400 is the S&P for
example, pulling back to those two lines.
And there's by the way, some other confluence areas there of moving averages on longer term
charts and shorter term charts that would all kind of meet in a general vicinity.
So I would, in the context of these oversold charts, we would be cooking oversold.
And sorry to interject, I just got to laugh that it's at 4,500 for folks that are listening
on a podcast and can't see this chart.
We were just at 4,500 back in what, November?
It's funny that that would be panic.
That would be a reason for the Fed to maybe justify cutting, which is a return to only
4,500.
Well, I mean, look, that's how these corrections go.
I mean, in essence from current highs, if they stick, I don't know, but if the current
highs were to stick, we're talking about a literally garden variety, eight percent correction.
That's what that would be, and the level actually I think is 45, 25, but who knows where, if
that were to happen.
We could have another one of those fake scary dips.
It's perfectly normal, eight percent correction, run off like this, perfectly normal.
But if I look at now how the market's been evolving and all of a sudden you see big cap
tech stocks just absolutely getting creamed, you just know how quickly sentiment is going
to shift.
It's the end of the world again, especially if you get a pierce down.
If you get a pierce down below the trend line, then we'd be looking at a massively oversold
chart.
Small caps would be puking again, banks, God knows what's going on with them.
We already see rumblings right now.
That's where the psychology then comes in, and then you could even make the argument,
"Oh my God, we've obviously dropped far below the 22 highs again, and this all looks like
a massive double top."
You can just see the narratives already and saying, "Oh my God, that was a big double
top.
It's all over.
Goodbye."
Sure.
I'm not saying that can't happen.
I'm just saying if we were to get such a pullback, which seems completely out of reach at the
moment, because we can't even have more than one down day on the occasion, because that's
just the way this market has been run.
But I'm just proposing this as a theoretical and say, "Let's say we were at that level
in March, right around the Fed meeting, everybody's scared.
There's a lot of confluence support there, and forget all the macro and everything else.
Technically, that looks extremely clean."
Now, as Mike Tyson once said, "Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face."
It's always nice to look at these things in theory, but when you get carpet bombed by
selling stocks, the psychology is always a very different one.
But I'm just saying in context of these fourth year seasonality and shop, it's a cool potential
set.
That's basically what I'm saying at this point.
We may not even get that low, or it may break.
These are the things that's what makes trading fun, right?
It's always uncertainty.
But I'm trying to be extremely flexible and practical here, but also keep an eye on what
has mattered so far.
And so far, this construct has mattered in a big way, it's been very important.
And yet again, at the moment when it could have broken, it was saved again, which has
been the hallmark of the last four years.
I guess that's where I'm going, which is where this to play out and hit that red zone that
you've identified there shouldn't be a shock to anybody with a brain or market experience
for all the reasons we just talked about.
It would be a perfectly normal thing to expect.
I just feel that your very correct points about the sentiment that we'd have then, it
really belies the story of strength and resilience that we're being told where just a small garden
variety pullback is interpreted by the market as the onset of Armageddon, right?
And it's kind of like a shark has to keep swimming or else it drowns, right?
We have this market that unless it's Christmas morning every day, it's the end of the world.
And I just wonder if that does belie the fact that everything we're sort of being told all
the reasons not to worry, it's like why if this thing just seems like it's going into
cardiac arrest every time it's not having a perfect day.
The hardest part of trading is psychology.
I think most traders would acknowledge that.
Everybody wants a dip until they actually have one and they're scared to buy.
And look, it happens to the best of them, the most professional ones.
Remember October 22, when the S&P was cracking through 3,600, you got first left, right and
center calling for 3,200.
And there's two coins to this because if you're in the midst of a heavy correction, you as
a trader always have to look at what the potential downside risk levels are, right?
You always want to be aware of pivots and yeah, you got to be aware of that.
Well, what then happens is when you're on Twitter or Wells and everybody is screaming
for these lower targets, it starts impacting people's psychology.
They get scared.
They get scared and then they're afraid to pull the trigger because they're afraid it
may go down to that level.
I guess no one heard of stop management.
You can manage that risk with stops by the way, but it's common human psychology and
you have to pull opposite when you have these big monster rallies that we've seen time and
time and time again that go on forever and ever and ever.
And they just keep squeezing and they defy credulity because they get dumber every time.
It's like, seriously, now you're upgrading?
Like BlackRock this week.
Okay, so we did what, 13 and up weeks and 14 and here comes BlackRock and upgrades to
your stock.
Thanks.
Where were you in October when it actually mattered.
And so then you have the polar opposite psychology as markets seem bulletproof.
We go up every day, every dip is bought, the VIX is crushed, nothing bad can happen and
the market ignores everything like in the last months now, even this week, we get news
of everybody bombing everyone.
It looks like it again.
No one cares.
No one cares.
What are your point about the Mag-7?
We have a bunch of companies getting pulled in front of Congress right now who's basically
debating whether or not these companies should start to be allowed to get sued or whatnot.
Nobody really seems to care.
No.
I mean, you know, one thing we can never trade on is geopolitical risk.
We can be aware it's out there, but generally the market ignores it.
Ukraine, Russia, that mattered for a little bit, but we're at new all time highs, the
war is still going on.
Israel, Hamas, that mattered for two weeks.
Right.
The closing of the Red Sea, yawn.
Yawn.
All that matters, and unfortunately I hate to be so bland about this, like we talked
last year, all that matters is the directional flow of liquidity and whether financial conditions
get tighter or looser.
And who's the boss on that, Janet?
And I'm not a political guy, but I'm also wise to the world, I would think, and I hate
to say it, but it's an election year and there are political motivations, you know, and I
don't like it, but I can see it in the works.
Right.
Pure coincidence that we're making new all time highs right at the beginning of a new
election year.
Right.
You might not like that there's a steamroller going down the street in a direction you don't
want it to go in, but it doesn't mean it's wise to stand in front of it.
That's exactly right.
I don't like that truck.
Let me stand in front of it.
Yeah.
I mean, that's the raging against the machine.
We all got to be, we may not like it, but we got to be practical and we got to understand
who controls what.
Now, if things change and we see breakdown of true support, like for example, that 4,500
area level, if that pattern were to bust down and break down and, you know, and it may get
temporarily, I don't know, but if that, you know, already the next level to look at, look
at, which is that yearly chart I showed earlier, which the yearly five EMA, that will support
every single year, it's a 4,300, you know, okay, show me an end of the year close below
that.
So if we drop that EMA drops further, okay.
It's going to start sinking a little bit.
So you may get to 4,300, the EMA is maybe at 4,200, you know, cause then by definition
they're moving averages.
They move along with what Bryce is doing.
So you got to keep an eye on them, you know, if we were to drop to, let's say 43, 4,200
from here, which is by the way, what is that November levels?
Yeah.
Like I was saying, yeah.
It would seem like the end of the world again, but all we're doing is again, touching key
historic support.
So unless you break this by the end of the year, sorry, bears, you've got nothing from
a large structural perspective, but I tell you one thing you do have, I bet you right
now if we were to drop this year below that yearly five EMA, by the end of the year, 2025
is going to be rate cut QE party time.
And presumably that is go long big time.
What when the COVID crash happened, where was the fed funds rate at the time?
It was much lower than it was now.
And you know how much power they unleashed.
And this was by the way, part of my consideration in the cynics guide to market, you know, for
years I've been rambling on about market cap to GDP, right?
Because yeah, we had the big tech bubble in 2000, where that got to 150% market value
revisions to be the vis-a-vis the underlying GDP of the economy.
Whereas in the seventies, eighties, it was around 60 to 80%.
So that what happened in 2000 was just unprecedented at the time.
And then we had the big recession and it got back to 75%.
Then they intervened, you know, and cut rates to zero.
And we got the housing bubble got to about 137, 140%.
And then we had the global financial crisis and it dropped to 50%.
And then of course, that was the beginning of permanent intervention.
And it got so bad following the COVID crash that we ended up at an all time peak of 200%
market cap to GDP.
Absolutely insane.
And guess what happened in 2002 when we had that year of down?
It just got back to the very top of the tech bubble, which was 150%.
That was the bottom, 150% is now the new floor.
And now we're heading back up to 180%.
And I used to rail at all this, and then I'm starting to suspect something much darker
going on here because it used to be that markets reacted to the economy, right?
But then it started disconnecting, you know, the phrases out there, you know, markets are
not the economy and vice versa.
Well, I have news for you when you have financial markets that are so much larger than the economy
itself, it's almost like a clear and present danger.
You cannot let this thing drop in a major way because everything is invested and centered
and financed by financial markets.
Also, maybe everything we talked about in terms of the magic savings makes sense.
If you're a policymaker, maybe you have two issues.
One is what influences which more?
Does the economy influence markets more that are much larger or is it markets influence
the economy more now that they've gotten so much bigger?
So if you really want to manage the economy, maybe what you have to do is manage markets.
I know it's dark because basically what it says is we are now in the business of driving
sentiment and consumer spending vis-a-vis the direction of markets.
We wanted to slow down markets with tightening, we brought markets down, but not to a point
where it could be a systemic issue.
Just enough, right?
Consumer sentiment on the floor.
Guess what?
Consumer sentiment is going back up now.
Why?
Because markets have been magically rising, right?
And this is where the second part comes in, which is either even darker part because we
talked about all these net constructs and how trapped they are in these refinancing
requirements.
Any party, it doesn't matter which one, cannot afford a just massive reset.
You wouldn't have a recession, you would have an outright catastrophe and depression, which
would be prohibitive to be able to even finance what you have to finance.
The whole system wouldn't work.
I'm almost afraid we've gotten to the point now where financial markets have to be managed
to prevent the unthinkable and because they've gotten so large vis-a-vis the economy, it's
actually convenient because you can manage the economy with that.
It's kind of self-serving in a way.
You would probably ask me, "Well, how is this all sustainable?"
Beats the hell out of me.
But if you're trapped in that way, you have no choice but to continue.
What the last four years have shown is how incredibly powerful and effective they are
in managing that equation.
Finally it's gone way beyond my expectations.
I'm impressed, I have to say.
I don't agree with it because guess what?
Here we are at new all-time highs and you know what that means.
The net worth of the top 0.1% is at all-time highs, over $20 trillion and by the way folks,
the top 0.1%, what is that?
That's 132,000 households, 132,000 households and you got to be worth at least 46 million
to be in that 0.1%, $20 trillion.
Don't even look where the bottom 50% are in aggregate, it's a pittance and obviously the
bottom 50%, it's over 100 million people, it's a huge number.
Rounding error assets-wise, sadly.
While everybody's victory lapping about the soft landing, just look at all transaction
prices of housing, record high.
Recessions used to serve a purpose which was cleansing of excess but now we are in a point
where housing is completely unaffordable for millions and millions and millions of people.
>> The majority.
>> The vast majority and especially the young who can't move out.
I mean I see it here in London too, oh my god, how are young kids supposed to afford
this?
>> You and I have kids, I think we're wondering how the hell are they going to afford all
this?
>> Yeah.
I'm thinking about buying them a boat, teaching them to sail, go somewhere.
It's a real issue and now we're in this position where everybody's claiming victory
on inflation and how insulting is that?
Because prices are sky high still, they're not going to come down, we're just a new normal
much higher up.
Housing hasn't corrected at all, you can argue commercial real estate but that doesn't apply
to the regular family.
So the middle class again got screwed here while the very top of the echelon got to keep
all of their post-COVID excess gains.
That top 0.1%, they added $5 trillion to their wealth following COVID and they're right back
at it.
>> Right.
>> 132,000.
>> Folks have heard me mention a lot on this channel recently that the new survey results
are out that in the US, 93% of financial assets are owned by the top 10% of households.
So it's funny, if the policy is that markets much go up, then the policy is the top elite
are going to get even more advantaged relative to everybody else or conversely, the advantage
is going to be much more disadvantaged.
>> Advantage is not even the term, I guess, it's just total dynasty wealth creation in
the hands of the few at the expense of the many because they're stuck with us.
>> National slash global aristocracy, yeah.
>> And look, I'm not a communist, I'm not a socialist, I've greatly benefited from the
capitalist system that we have but that's a social trend that scares the hell out of
me.
>> Yeah, me too.
And you and I have talked a lot about this in the past and I actually had a question
here about it because we should probably do a discussion that's just focused on that Sven
because I think we have a lot of material to say.
Let me ask you this and you might not have an answer to this, it's okay if you don't,
but let's say I make you emperor Sven, okay?
So for a limited period of time, you can tell everybody what to do.
What reforms would you think of to try to address this accelerating wealth inequality
gap?
>> This is where, first of all, I don't want to be emperor, I just know absolute power
corrupts absolutely, is it not?
>> Yeah, but like I said, it's a limited period of time.
If you don't give up the reins, we cut your head off but you get a limited period of time
to do some good.
I hate to say it, I wouldn't like the solutions that maybe would be obvious.
I mean, I hear people talking about taxing the hell out of the rich or what have you.
A lot of people are really wealthy because they've actually done really well for themselves,
they've worked hard, they've been smart, they've been building successful businesses.
I'm not making this a enemy of the rich, I think most rich people, unless they just fell
into it by inheritance, I think most people that are rich and have worked themselves into
position to be rich, they deserve to be rich.
And then I can look here at the UK where I'm paying just ridiculous amounts of taxes and
I say, come on guys, really?
This is insane.
And what are you doing with it?
What am I getting for in return?
But at the same time, when you are wealthy and the wealthy have power to lobby and help
set the rules, if you will, they've gained a lot of additional advantages in actual terms
of tax structures and clever ways of shell companies and this, that and the other.
There's a lot of people that are gaming the system to their advantage because greed, I
guess, right?
If you have a billion, you want three, if you have three, you want 10.
Mine is enough.
I'm afraid it's not one of those things that can be solved organically, but it's also one
of those things I would not want to see solved top down, meaning by force.
By redistributive, hey, we're just taking all your money.
The ideal, and this is where maybe the, again, you scratch the cynic and find a disappointment
ideal is the ideal way would be actually what happened organically, that there is an appeal
to our better angels as a society to recognize the path we've been on and are going on in
this direction is not for the betterment of our global village society, whatever you want
to call it, and it's going to lead to a really dark path.
When I see billionaires that have all the wealth they could ever want in the world arguing
like children on Twitter, I'm very disappointed, guys.
You're the guys that have built great companies, you're the guys that have the smarts.
What is that behavior?
Could we elevate everything a little bit?
The problem is we have no elevation.
I look at the political spectrum these days, and I'm just absolutely disappointed in humanity.
Sorry, folks.
Plato would not be impressed.
I don't see anything on the political horizon system.
Things are going to get better.
There's adults in the room.
It's all gamified.
It's ugly.
I hate to say it.
Sometimes this better angel organic view may only come if something really terrible happens.
It's during a crisis and after a crisis that people get together and figure things out
and help each other.
Right.
And say, "Hey, maybe there's a better way to do this because what we were doing before
led to this terrible crisis."
I'm on record many times on this channel saying, "Sadly, my money is on that, that we are
not going to proactively change our ways for the better.
We're going to keep doing what we're doing until we're forced to change."
I got to start wrapping it up here, Sven.
I could keep going forever.
Thank you again for just putting it all out there the way you always do.
On this topic, just to wrap it up, there are two things that I suss out of what you were
saying that I think you would be on board with, and I'm just going to pose them back
to you just to see.
One of the reasons why I want to have this conversation is that I keep bringing up this
topic about the wealth disparity and the trajectory it's on because I have the exact same concerns
that you do.
It's a pretty emotionally charged topic.
Most people, I think, are on board with growing wealth disparity bad.
But when you start to get to specific potential solutions, that's where people really start
getting triggered.
"Oh, that's socialist," or, "Oh, I'm a libertarian, and that goes against my ideals," or whatever.
But the system has metastasized so far, the time for elegant solutions may have passed.
And I don't know.
I just want to have the debate.
And so I'm hoping this channel can continue to have a debate on this discussion because
just like you're talking with the markets, we might not like where they're going or how
they're run, but just to stand in front of the truck at a protest isn't in our best interest.
It's not going to help us.
We're just going to get mowed over by it.
So anyways, two things that I thought I heard you say that maybe you'd be on board with
is one is, if you're an emperor, get money out of politics.
I know it sounds simple and is incredibly hard, and most people say that'll never happen,
but that would be a big one.
And then the second one would be stop intervening with natural market forces.
I think that would be a way where we could bring that gap down pretty substantially just
by letting markets do what they want to do without all the intervention that's going
on.
And this would be painful, right?
It wouldn't be fun, but it would be a natural fairway.
But this is where it's hostage taking because let's suppose you and I had the chance to
talk to the powers that be and plead with them, stop intervening with markets.
If I were them, I would tell it to the both of us, Adam and Sven, okay, we can stop intervening
in markets.
And by the way, your other issue, wealth inequality, which 20 million people you want to see unemployed?
Yeah.
But to my point, I think we're well beyond the point.
Billionaire one, two, three, four, and five, okay, he'll lose a few billions of his portfolio.
He's still a billionaire at the end of this.
Which millions of families are you going to screw with a systemic crash of a system?
Yeah.
Sorry.
We bloated it up to this degree.
But if you want us to stop intervening in markets, that's what's going to happen.
Yeah.
But I think you'll get back out.
Yeah.
If you capitulate there, you're stuck in that hostage situation forever, right?
So can we have the system correct to a point where it will be more sustainable going forward,
hopefully be more fair and maybe more widely distributive of prosperity going forward,
but you got to take the pain, right?
That's one of the problems here, which is there is no painless door, right?
And yeah, it'll hurt to fall from this rung on the ladder.
But if we wait another 10 or 20 years, we're just going to be that much further high up
the ladder.
So whether we choose austerity, which we never will, or if it gets imposed on us, that fall
is going to hurt even more.
So I get your point though.
It's not a crowd-pleaser.
No.
I mean, COVID was kind of an interesting example, right?
Because we had the crash and to be fair, they went in and they saved everybody and everything,
right?
We stimulus checks to help for families and this, that, the other.
Yeah.
What would the size of the check, 600 bucks, 1,600, I forget what it was.
No, there were a couple of different sizes, but yeah.
There were a couple of different sizes, you know.
But the top 0.1% got 5 trillion in global wealth, you know, that amongst 132,000 households.
Yeah.
Again, completely disproportionate, but that's, how else do you do that when you're so dependent
on markets?
I don't have the answer.
I'm just seeing an ever more divergent political climate across the globe.
And I see ever more political instability as a result of this.
No one can see eye to eye and if you can't see eye to eye, you can't even talk about
solutions.
Right.
Well, and in addition to the political instability, you're going to get social instability at
some point if this keeps going, right?
And we've already seen it begin to break out in other places, right?
Nobody wants to see that, but sadly, I think that's where we're headed to.
All right.
So I got to land the plane here.
I've got one more question I'm going to ask you Sven in just a minute.
I got some housekeeping to do first.
That question is going to be what's one non-money related investment you'd encourage folks to
develop in their lives because we've been talking so much about money so far this conversation.
Very quickly, folks, if you've enjoyed this conversation with Sven, we'd like him to come
back on the program again in the future, particularly if he sees something in his charts that make
him think that something important is imminent, please let him know to do that by hitting
the like button, then clicking on the red subscribe button below.
What was that little bell icon right next to it, want to remind folks that the Wealthion
Spring Conference is coming up fast.
It's going to be at March 16th.
Yeah, it's going to be Saturday, March 16th.
Tickets are already selling very strongly for that, which is great to see.
A lot of folks are taking advantage of my urging to register now so you can lock in
our lowest early bird price discount.
It's nice to see so many folks doing that.
And then if you're a subscriber to my premium substack, you get additional $50 off of that.
To go learn more about the event and lock in that low price, go to ThoughtfulMoney.com/Conference.
Just a reminder for folks, Sven has talked a lot about the uncertainty of what 2024 may
bring and several times mentioned, hey, some prudent management, like maybe some stop management
or having some hedges given how overextended the market is.
It all comes down, like I say, pretty much week after week that the most people watching
this should be working with a good professional financial advisor who can put together a plan
for them with those type of loss protection mechanisms in place.
Most people just don't have the experience, the bandwidth with their lives or the interest
to do all this, quite frankly.
So I highly recommend that you find a good professional advisor to do that.
If you've got a good one who's doing it for you, great, stick with them.
But if you don't, consider scheduling a free consultation with one of the ones that we
endorse here at Thoughtful Money.
These are the guys to see on the channel every week, like the guys from New Harbor, Lance
from RIA, and Jonathan Wellum up in Canada.
To set up one of those free consultations, just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com, fill out the
short form there.
Doesn't cost you anything, no commitment to work with those guys, just a free public service
they offer.
Okay, Sven, we're here at the end here, my friend.
That non-money-related investment, what do you got for us?
Well, at risk that Tim Cook is going to be upset with me, I would suggest don't get any
Apple goggles and actually do the pull-up.
I mean, I've got phases in my life where I've gotten frustrated, and I've gotten out of
shape, and I've gotten stressed, and I've gotten angry, and I realize that this is just
not a good state to be.
What's the old outage?
Health is wealth, contentment is wealth, and from my perspective, there's nothing more
important to do than find a really nice health balance.
I know we all have to sit in front of screens and looking at markets or work or whatever
you do, and we carry these phones with us around.
Spend as much outside as you can.
Fitness, manage your calorie intake.
I mean, the last couple of years after COVID, I ballooned up, I lost a bunch of weight.
I feel so much better, and if you're balanced with yourself and your body, you just have
a whole better attitude to life.
And don't argue with people and strangers on social media, why?
That's all part of the equation.
I know there's all these professional agitators out there.
Don't take everything seriously, just try to find inner balance and spend as much time
outside and don't, my God, don't buy these goggles.
I think I put a tweet out the other day, we're going to go extinct.
Just imagine all of us with these goggles and droning around.
We're getting ever more disconnected from the real world, and it's just not for me.
I'm trying to keep it real.
All right.
Well, very well said.
Keep it real, my friend.
Health both physical and mental probably is nothing more important than that.
I'd share your concerns, especially if you've ever seen the movie Ready Player One.
You look at the Apple goggles now and you're like, "Oh my God, we're stepping into that
dystopian future right now."
I will say one thing about fitness, and you and I talk about it a lot off air, Sven, we
both have a huge respect for it.
One thing that I've done recently, just because I had so many things knocking me off my game
last year, and everybody knows this, family passing away, the COVID and the exam I was
taking and all that stuff, one is my gifts to myself health-wise from the start of this
year has been to do meal prep.
Nutrition is such an important part of physical fitness, and I think it also helps the mental
fitness too.
It's really an unfair part.
If you want to change how your body looks, nutrition is much more important than actually
exercise, sad it is to say.
We all think, "Oh, I can just go run a few extra miles."
Much less impact than actually getting your eating dialed in.
But when you do meal prep, God, it just makes your life so much easier.
It takes a lot of the worry.
It takes a lot of the frustration.
If you can just stick to the meals that you've prepared for yourself on the plan that you've
prepared for yourself, you don't have any of that shame or self-loathing when you're
finding yourself just snacking too much during the day, and it makes just a huge difference
in everything.
So one little small change folks, and it's a change that can help your pocketbook too.
You can buy in bulk and prepare in bulk.
There's only goodness that comes out of it.
So I'll stop with that commercial, but I'm a huge fan of nutrition and meal prep.
All right, Sven, as always, my friend, it's always so great to catch up with you.
Like I said, you've got an open invitation to come back on this channel any time you
like.
Thanks so much for giving us so much of your time today.
And everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
Thanks Adam.
Take care.
Bye.
