Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
Recent inflation reports show that it's proving sticky, stubbornly refusing to recede down to the
target rates that central banks are shooting for. But rather than simply staying sticky, could it
actually start surging again? Today's guest expert thinks it could due to growing global economic
imbalances. If that happens, what would the implications be? And what can investors do
proactively today to prepare? For answers, we turn to macro and commodities expert Tavi Costa
of Crescat Capital. Tavi, thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for having me, Adam. Looking
forward to this. Thanks. Tavi, it's a total pleasure having you on. I think this is your first
appearance here on Thoughtful Money. It will definitely not be your last. I appreciate
very much you coming on the program here. I follow your work religiously, Tavi. You are a prolific
publisher of analysis. But one of the things that I think you really do is a huge service
to macro students like myself is you produce really just some of the best charts out there,
hands down, that really help us visually understand what's going on. So I've been reading a lot of your
recent work and I saw you put out this, I call it a warning necessarily, but a thesis that inflation
could really start ramping back up here. I want to dig into that with you. Before we do though,
can we just jump off at the general question I like to ask you when we sit down and talk,
which is what's your current assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
Well, that's a good question. Thanks for having me, Adam. I think that there's a lot of things
obviously that comes to mind when I get asked that question. In the commodities industry,
I think we've been in a consolidation period for some time now and it's interesting how the
commodity space usually works through a cycle. Usually you have a few commodities that are hot
and then others that are not as hot anymore. So you got cocoa right now, orange juice was
the hot commodity not too long ago. And then you see the new ones like gold and then oil has been
in a consolidation for some time, but they all work together. To me, that is a big picture of
where inflation is going to fit into as we see hard assets continue to improve in terms of
appreciation. Regarding the economy itself, we've been in a place I thought we would have been in a
recession already, but the reckless amount of fiscal spending has been one of the big
components of why we haven't seen a bigger deceleration of growth in the economy and
potentially what's been driving all that. And the other thing has been certainly the leadership on
the mega caps. So my assessment of that is that the leadership is, to me, a problem. I mean,
the lack of companies actually leading the market in a large way, overall speaking here in the US
economy, especially seeing the divergence of small cap companies, equal weighted and other parts of
the market relative to the larger portions is something to be aware of. We're starting to see
a deceleration as well or a deterioration of the labor markets, which I think is an important one.
And I think gold is sniffing something. I mean, it's clearly something that none of us really
know what it is, but we all suspect that it has to do with further debasement of currencies and
other issues. And so now we're in this environment where there's definitely a speculation, multiples
in most of the equity markets. I would put into buckets that it's technology, consumer
discretionary are the big sectors that are probably driving most of the valuations in
markets right now, and particularly the mega cap ones. And we've seen some movement towards
the metals and mining industry recently, nothing like we think to the degree that we think. And
certainly the reshoring is becoming bigger than the green revolution. And it's hard to believe
that we're going to see construction spending to the levels that not only we've seen in the
last 12 months, but that we will probably see in the next 10 years without making the metals
and mining industry much larger. So I know I'm going all over, but those are most of the thoughts
that I have. And when I think about the risk of interest rates and that whole narrative that most
people were referring to as higher rates for longer, I think that's the case with inflation
specifically. And we can get into that, but inflation to me is the main reason why I believe
emerging markets will do better than developed markets, where I believe the natural resource
industries will do better than the traditional businesses in general, particularly technology.
I think that's going to create opportunities in apex markets too, given that setup. And there's
going to be outflows from especially foreign investors that have fully allocated capital into
US equities that are yet to transition away from that, and that rotation will create a lot of
opportunities as well. Okay, yeah. Well, that script there is kind of like the opposite of
what's going on right now. So that would create a lot of opportunity for folks who anticipate that
if it indeed happens. So yeah, so it sounds like inflation is kind of the lens that you're
looking through most right now. Why don't we just go straight to that? What are the reasons why you
see it heading higher? And maybe if I can just ask you in your answer to address you, you talked
about how, in your opinion, the reckless fiscal spending is what's been sort of pushing off the
economic slowdown, at least here in the States. Presumably, you can't just do all that fiscal
spending without any implications. There's got to be some price to pay. Is inflation the price
you pay for that? Yeah, I think that's what it is. And I would say, I used to categorize inflation
in what I used to call pillars of inflation, and I still call them that. And they're all specific
parts of it. There's the chronic under-investments in natural resource industries, just looking at
the CapEx for producers and commodities. It looks very obvious that companies have
under-invested. The second one is what's happening with the labor cost. We're seeing protests and not
only that, but folks requiring higher compensations and all sorts of things. And that's, to me,
that's something similar to what we saw in the 1940s. The reckless amount of fiscal spending is
also playing an important role here. And I think the most important one of the pillars
is de-globalization, which potentially started in 2015, 2016, between US and China tensions. And
that kind of escalated to all these other issues, especially conflicts between regions and countries
that we haven't seen in centuries, and now they're coming back and becoming more prominent.
Now, to me, I would say that there are some new trends going on. I think three months ago it was
a lot harder to make the case that we would see a re-acceleration of inflation. And learning from
the 1910s, the 1940s, and the 1970s, I think the big lesson was that inflation develops through
waves. And I'm a firm believer that that model will work again today. And so not only from a
math standpoint, but also from a psychological perspective of business owners and also consumers.
And so now we're seeing the conflicts at the Red Sea causing the freight costs to go higher. And
people start seeing those things as unique things, and they're not. They're all really interconnected
in a bigger picture. And then you have today, in fact, agricultural commodities surpassed the
levels that they did reach back during the Russian invasion in Ukraine. That's going to have an
impact in food prices, ultimately, in my opinion. We're seeing gasoline prices starting to rise as
well. And all those things are going to be important, but there's one more that I would call
perhaps the fifth pillar of inflation that is even more important than all this, which is what's
happening with immigration. There's illegal immigration is increasing in the U.S. in a way
that we haven't seen probably ever. This is really unprecedented in terms of the number of people
coming to the United States, and mostly illegally. And that will ultimately drive shelter costs.
I think that that's going to be a large component that will surprise a lot of
deflationistas that think that a shelter cost is actually going to go away in terms of the pressure
to the upside of consumer goods and services. I'm actually of the opposite view on that front. I
actually think that shelter cost is going to be pressured to the upside given the size of the
population, actually increasing and demanding a place to live. You can read all sorts of
academical reports in regards to that type of immigration change in a country and the types of
consequences that it tends to lead to. And one of them is inflation without a doubt. There are
other things as well, potentially the risk of crimes and other things also could be the case
here. But I think the main one certainly is the cost of living is going to have to be also
increased. And so as we see that occurring, I would think that inflation will reaccelerate
in a much bigger, faster pace. And the second thing that will probably be part of the narrative,
and it hasn't really participated, but I just can't believe it wouldn't, is oil. Oil is
interesting because it was a very hot narrative back two years ago or so when Russia invaded
Ukraine and all sorts of other things kind of led to oil prices going to $130 a barrel. And today,
you know, we're back below 70s or so, right in the 70s, 75. I think that there's a very important
level in oil. If we do surpass $85 a barrel, I think we're going to see a reacceleration in oil
prices, energy prices in general, very similar to what we've seen in gold. And I think that's going
to be a big part of the reacceleration of inflation narrative. And so that's one way to kind of express
that view on something that hasn't happened yet that I think is highly probable to occur.
So yeah, a lot to unpack there, but those are some thoughts on inflation that I think will
be very critical to how we manage money, but also how investors will be pricing assets moving
forward. Okay, so how much of this is looking over the next decade, and just saying, I think we're
going to have a secularly higher inflation for all these pillars that you mentioned? And how much of
this do you think, you know, we're starting to see now with with the difficulty of trying to push
inflation down below three, like, like, is this a tomorrow problem that you're talking about? Or
is this game already starting? Well, and Adam, I think, you know, unfortunately, a lot of my
charts and research, a lot of people try to day trade a lot of those things, I feel like this new
generation, and as a reflection of the speculative environment we're in, think that they can make
money so quickly on things. And no, it's not, it's nothing that will happen tomorrow. I think this,
these are big macro trends that are developing over time that will create and unleash a lot of
trends that also would be very opportunistic from an investment standpoint. But, you know,
I think that the biggest one in terms of inflation being higher for longer, and I just mean,
what I mean by that is, if you look at annual rate of inflation per decade, I just think that
this decade will actually be higher than historical standards. And the prior decades that we've seen
this was 1910s, 1940s, and 1970s. Everyone can claim, and I don't disagree, that all those were
somewhat different than today. You know, they, you know, in the 70s, we didn't have the debt problem.
We had the issue with labor costs increasing and some de-globalization issues that cause,
you know, the oil embargo situation, some others. In the 40s, you know, in the early parts of the
40s and late parts of the 30s, we kind of had the World War II that also caused inflation in a big
way. But then we had a more globalized environment. That was a peak of de-globalization that was very
different than today in which also the banks had to buy US Treasuries, restore financial repression.
All sorts of things were playing and actually gold and the dollar were packed. And so it was
a very different environment, much more disciplinary, believe it or not, than today.
And then the 1910s was, you know, you had the pandemic that happened, you had the World War I,
all sorts of things happened there as well, but it was also more, there was a lot more discipline
from a monetary policy perspective and, you know, compared to today. And so what are the things that
happened in those decades that is important? Those are important takeaways. Well, first of all,
hard assets did really well, not only hard assets, but hard assets are companies that produced those
assets that did quite well relative to the overall market. What is different about today, not from a
debt perspective, which we saw in the forties, is definitely the fact that we have valuations
really extreme in financial assets. We didn't see this in the 1910s and 1940s or the 1970s. And so
it is a little tricky to think about, you know, if inflation really is going to be higher for longer
and historically higher relative to other, the prior decades here, then what does that mean about
financial assets being so already frothing in terms of valuations? Can they return even more
than what they have done in the last 10 years or so? No, and I would be very cautious about that
because knowing how inflation works, it usually causes the cost of capital to rise and cost of
capital then, you know, helps you to understand how to discount a business. And if your interest
rate is higher, your discount rate is higher, then the present value of that asset has to be lower.
And so, you know, ultimately I would think that that has to impact the valuation of companies,
particularly the ones that have very frothy valuations. But the real opportunity,
if you think about this is, you know, we all would like to kind of look at the big short idea,
right? What happened in the big short in '08 and the banking crisis and all that, and kind of think
about that framework today, but the big short really is the debasement of currencies. I mean,
there's no way around this. It's the monetary dilution given the overwhelming amount of debt
that we have in the system is undeniable, but also, you know, there is no way around this
situation outside of creating inflation to get out of this issue. And so as we see this path moving
forward, I think it's always important to look back on Japan. And Japan is a very good roadmap
for a lot of the issues we're seeing. Yes, Japanese markets are making new highs, but the stock market
there is really cheap relative to the US. But one important thing is if you look at gold and silver
and copper, all in Japanese yen terms, they're all making new highs. And if not, they're close to it.
And, you know, that is an important roadmap to me because I do think that a lot of the businesses
that are linked to those hard assets are basically priced for failure. And not only that, they're
very distressed, particularly the metals and mining industry. The same is happening with
emerging markets, which, you know, we can go on. And I have got this whole thesis in my mind about
what I call the AI paradox, which is related to all these technological investments we're seeing.
But anyways, I think that the big picture is how many opportunities will be created here in a
natural resource space and thinking about resource rich economies and the risk that you're running,
you know, buying what most people are talking about, which is, you know, AI related stocks
and semiconductors and, you know, all sorts of things that look really expensive on a historical
basis. All right. So let's dig into that then. So what I hear you're saying is particularly because
of this higher for longer inflation outlook that you have over the, I'm just going to say coming
decade, and we don't know exactly how long it's going to be, but it's going to be some secular
duration, that you think that hard assets and the companies that produce them are going to perform
well. And then on top of that, you're saying hard assets and a lot of sectors, the companies that
produce them are kind of unloved right now. So it sounds like it's a little bit of a twofer,
right, where you get companies that have really good prospects, but you're able to buy them at
a really good value right now. And that's in contrast to maybe AI right now, which,
I mean, might have good prospects, who knows, but it's hard not to argue that it's not,
the hype hasn't gotten pretty extreme. And certainly the valuations have gotten certainly
extreme. So at least in the case of these hard asset producers, you might be able to buy tomorrow's
winners at bargain basement prices today. Is that kind of how you look at it?
Yeah. And I think, Adam, we often talk about in the markets, I know some people say you want to
buy high and sell higher, but ultimately what we learn is that what you really should be trying
to do is buy something low and sell high. But that concept, although it sounds so simple,
it's actually really difficult to do. And the main reason for that is because psychologically,
for whatever reason, investors just don't like something that is cheap. I don't know why. I mean,
this is the only place in the world where a system of valuing financial assets, when things get
cheaper, people run away from it. And the investors that are able to sustain that emotional stability,
to be able to have the conviction to deploy capital into an industry or a company or a country
that is distressed at a situation that you disagree with the market because of the inefficiencies that
are being caused. Those are usually the best opportunities you can find. And so,
there are some pockets of the markets that look like that. And why does a business in Brazil,
just call it a financial company in Brazil, trades at one, two, three times earnings when you have
another company in the U.S. trading 50 times revenues. And so, that deserves some sort of
premium for being in the U.S. But that spread between those two valuations is really extreme,
just as one example. I mean, I can give more examples. Why Microsoft has a higher
market cap than the entire energy sector combined, knowing that the entire energy sector combined
makes, generates more free cashflow or double the amount of free cashflow than Microsoft alone.
And so, those are really, this is just those types of imbalances that are completely unsustainable.
There's a reason why Warren Buffett owns a ton of oil companies today. And I think that that's
probably going to be translating into higher oil prices as well at some point. And so, I think I've
never seen in my life this disconnect of metal prices, for instance, relative to the metals and
mining industry. Using a similar example, if you just look at Microsoft and Apple today,
they have 70 times the size of the overall metals and mining industry. I can't think of a world
where we see reshoring, revamping of manufacturing, all these constructions that may happen in the
future, ports and airports and all sorts of things without making the metals and mining industry at
least a little more relevant than what it is today. It's basically irrelevant in the market. And so,
when I see those things, I think the general investor that looks at something cheap, like,
let's just pick on metals and mining, what the usual argument is, is look how these companies
have done. They have done very poorly. They've been bleeding capital. Their balance sheets look
awful, blah, blah, blah. And I think that the mindset of an investor is usually always looking
at the future, not the past. The fact that something hasn't worked for years and decades is
main reason why it should be in your radar for the future. And so, that's how I approach things.
And if I can find enough reasons of why, especially the underlying metal into those
mining companies is supposed to be doing much better in the near future, then it checks all
my boxes, essentially. I really want to get into that space. And we've built a business investing
in exploration. There's a lack of geologists, as I think I've mentioned in your programs in the past,
but there's a lack of geologists in this industry. And that is actually causing a problem of
inefficiency because if you invest in exploration, for instance, which requires a lot of technical
knowledge, if there is not enough geologists out there, people don't know how to interpret the data.
And so, the public markets become fundamentally broken because they don't even know how to
interpret data that those mining companies are putting out there. And so, if you take an
activist approach or a much more long-term mentality to buy those assets and really try
to unlock value, I think that's brilliant. And so, this is just one. I mean, there's other things
in a natural resource space that can be done as well that could be just as interesting. And the
same thing can be applied even in emerging markets. I think that the political environment
in emerging markets will always be a risk that would never change. Brazil, for instance, will
always be risky politically speaking. But there are times when markets shift their prioritization
outside of the political risk but into other things like being a resource-rich economy.
And I think we're starting to see that there's a reason why Brazil is outperforming
a lot of other markets. And I think that's just the beginning. I think we're going to see a lot
more than that. All right. Well, I want to dig into exactly where you see the opportunity and
where you're directing your focus as an investor in this space. Perhaps if you've got it handy,
I don't know if you do or not, but you have a great chart there that basically shows
the relative valuation of commodities to the S&P, I think, or the equity markets in general.
And I'm doing this from memory. But I think that's been very depressed of late. I don't know if it
started ticking up yet or not. But I mean, that there's a good visualization of just sort of the
opportunity set that you're talking about. If the pendulum begins to shift back into this space,
I'm probably overexaggerating, but kind of unloved right now. While you're looking for that, let me
just ask you a question about what you guys are doing at Crescat. So you have your own funds that
you manage for clients, private client capital. You're out there investing in these exploration
companies, which are super high risk, because you might find gold, you might not. Those companies
are taking the risks. But to your point of there being a lack of geologists, you guys
have a renowned geologist as your partner. So you're taking kind of like a BYOG approach to
this. Bring your own geologist. And if your geologist can read the results well, because
he's experienced, you've got an edge on the general market. Because as you said, a lot of
these people don't have the talent to interpret the results correctly. Does that summarize that
fairly? Yeah. And I think it's also an issue of lack of capital in the space and the lack of
capital, given the fact that there is no attention there. And I think it's pretty simple to explain
as far as how the industry works. I mean, that there's producing companies, developers and
exploration and royalties too. But the more you go to the producing side, it's more de-risked. And
those companies are usually have consistent cash flows and so forth with some exceptions,
especially at the beginning of those producing assets, but more at the end of it or middle parts,
they're more consistent. And it doesn't require a lot of technical work, meaning a geologist
doesn't need to necessarily cover those companies, because it's not necessarily as relevant as other
things. And so now if you think about what's happening in the development side, it's more
engineering and figuring out how to build a mine and how much is it going to cost and all those
things is much more financially savvy and engineering savvy in that portion. Now, when you
talk about exploration, it is very, very technically savvy. I mean, that you need to be in order to
do very well. It's extremely risky. But the whole point of this is that there are companies that
drill in their property and they're intercept things that are mineralized, which means that
they basically have hit something that has whatever the mineral is. And at the same time,
you should be applying, increasing the probability of finding a deposit, right? Because you found
something mineralized. So should you have a deposit there at least a probability of finding
that should be higher than what was estimated by the market prior to those drill results.
And what you see here is that a lot of those situations is that the company reports those
numbers and actually collapses on the back of many other reasons because they have to raise money
again, or because it would end up being a liquidity event for a certain investor. And look, the
probability of finding a deposit, a major deposit actually only increase. And so either the company
has to find an absolutely beast meaning of a deposit, like a perfect laid out ore body, or
it's just going to get penalized in the markets moving forward. And so it created a lot of
opportunities because those types of the puzzle, there might not be those perfect ore bodies,
but they're very economically viable and also likely to be chased by the major companies that
need to kind of replenish their production line, ultimately will probably be in hot demand if you
have a bull market in precious metals. And so holding those assets to me, it looks really
attractive just from that standpoint. And it's so hard to see that because we haven't seen a bull
market in space for a really long time, but majority of the high quality assets in exploration
actually are the ones that lead the way to the upside when you have a bull market in gold.
And I think we're probably entered one of those because gold prices just broke out recently. And
what we're not seeing is basically the catching up that we need to see from silver, copper,
even other metals, palladium, platinum. And then you have on the other side, you have the miners
that have been really, really lagging. And if you look at the miners to gold ratio, they're
retesting levels that we only seen in the '70s. And look, the '70s was a great time to be invested
in the space. And a lot of people would say, well, the reason for this, the reason for this
underperformance, it has to do with the fact that we're seeing higher costs. And look, I mean,
I do my own research on this as well. And I think that that is a problem. However, why does it not
apply to copper miners? Why do copper miners relative to copper are diverging from gold
miners relative to gold? That's a good question because the cost is not very different.
And I think the main reason for that is that fundamentally the gold companies actually have
a much bigger deterioration of the quality of their reserves than the copper miners. And that's
being reflected in the price of their assets ultimately. And so, again, it's all opportunities,
I think, and therefore why I'm so deep into the space. And not to mention the fact that we haven't
seen an M&A cycle in a very long time. And we know the need for those companies to, again,
to replenish their reserves. They're not finding investing in exploration. They're not finding new
ore. And in fact, they've been depleting their reserves. And not only that, but the average
grade of their existing reserves have been declining as well. So all those things are
becoming a problem fundamentally for those bigger miners that have to start buying the smaller
miners to increase their businesses. And so I've never seen in my career a time that is better to
be doing kind of an acquisitive strategy, kind of a roll-up strategy than today. I mean, this is
as good as it gets, in my opinion. Prices are very low. And there are major companies looking even to
sell some of their assets, which is crazy. And look, I mean, for people that are opportunistic,
this is as good as it gets, I think. All right. As good as it gets for people who are opportunistic.
And let me know if you're able to find that chart. If not, no worries. I'll track it down later on.
Okay, great. So let's specifically talk about gold. And then we'll wrap up by talking about
any other commodity areas that you think are particularly well positioned to ride this
new era you think that we have. So presumably, demand for gold should go up in an inflationary
environment, right? That being said, gold did pretty well as inflation started taking off when
we had 9% reported CPI. It did well by kind of hanging in there. It didn't run off to the races
the way that a lot of long-time gold holders would have expected with a CPI that high. But it didn't
go down like a lot of other assets did in 2022. Would you expect gold to perform better than it
is right now in this inflationary decade coming up? Well, it's interesting because the gold
community that's been in the business for a very long time, but don't follow macro, they always
think that gold should follow inflation, because that's what happened in the 70s and during those
periods. But then the more recent macro community would argue against that. They would say, no,
gold should not go up because of an expectation of inflation going higher. Gold goes up because
of monetary dilution and all sorts of things. And maybe real rates is the main reason.
Look, I don't think anybody knows the answer for this, but I'll try to answer the question. I think
since 2021, there has been some major changes in correlations across macro assets.
2021, I call that the post COVID world has been kind of a fundamental shift in the markets in
terms of correlations. And the main reason for that is because we started to see interest rates
rise. And we haven't seen this in a very long time. And the main reason for that, although
the Fed had high grades and so forth, it was really because of the overwhelming amount of debt
and the level of assurances that we've seen in the treasury market over the last years that really
kind of flooded the market and caused interest rates to rise to degrees that we're seeing
currently. And to a certain point, that break of correlation where real rates decline and actually
cause gold to rise has been always a relationship that people have really relied on. And then all
of a sudden that relationship breaks where gold becomes very resilient and rates go up in real
terms and nominal terms. And it went up substantially. And if you looked at even global
bonds, just looking at the overall aggregate of global bonds used to track gold really closely,
it completely collapsed. I'll tell you another one that used to be a safe haven like gold,
Japanese yen, the Japanese yen collapsed. And so all these things are starting to happen.
We saw that growth to value rotation, if you recall as well, which was in line with those
issues. And then came in 2023 and 2023, we kind of saw the opposite of a lot of those things. And
the market went up back to new highs and we're back to the speculative environment because of
AI and other things and the reckless amount of fiscal spending. Interest rates are still really
high. And so I think there's been a difficult shift in terms of markets or investors
interpreting the data into inflation means gold should go higher. But I think this is
starting to change now. It's really interesting that inflation is starting to show signs of
reacceleration again, from many fronts that as I pointed out here in a couple of minutes ago,
and at the same time, gold is starting to break out. So I think that that's starting to change.
The gold bugs that used to think that if gold goes up because inflation expectation is going higher,
they might be right now. It might be the case that that's exactly what gold is pricing in,
is that we're going to see a reacceleration of inflation. Another thing that I would say that
got lost in the last decade has been the fact that we saw all this money printing and supposedly we
didn't see inflation on CPI numbers. We saw inflation in financial assets and other things,
but CPI didn't go up. And so a lot of people said, well, that correlation is broken. You
can print money and inflation doesn't come in. And then it comes in COVID where they print a ton
of money, or if you don't want to use that term technically, you just want to say expense expansion
of the monetary base and in line with as well, coinciding with the number of the amount of fiscal
spending that created inflation. And today we're seeing one of the most restrictive monetary
policies we've seen in many years, supposedly. And even on the back of that, monetary base is
actually increasing today by about $400 billion just recently. And so what would you expect that
to be if we have a recessionary environment where the Fed is actually forced to do all
these other things? So basically we're having QE without calling it QE. It's just really,
really what it is. And people really try to get the nitty gritty of the technical terms of all this,
but if you're creating a banking facility to support the banks and using the repo market
and all sorts of tools just to prop up your economy, I think that's just another way of
calling a stimulative process of your monetary policy. And so those things have been certainly
playing a role into gold markets in my view, and I've never seen a gold market that doesn't
lead to other commodities having a bull market. So this is why I get really excited because I
think ultimately it's going to drive all those things and it will trickle down to the businesses
too that invest in those underlying commodities. All right. So gold could be, no guarantees,
but gold could be if this breakout has legs and things play out the way you think they will. It
could be the lead sled dog that begins to bring the other commodities along with it. So we're
looking at this chart here of yours which shows peaks and troughs of the commodities to equity
ratio. And for the past 16 years, it's been on a steady decline coming down from the peak that it
hit during the global financial crisis. It may have dropped here. It kind of looks here at the
last wiggle that it's kind of picking itself up off the floor. You are basically saying you're
seeing a setup like we saw in the early '70s where this ratio just rocketed from the 1%
range up to like a 9x increase. But you're saying from an even bigger imbalance. So we might even
see bigger moves than we've seen in the past year. Any commentary you want to say about this chart?
I mean, it sort of tends to speak for itself. It just says, hey, they seem dirt cheap on a relative
basis to equities. It speaks for itself. But a lot of people, like I said, the concept of buying
low and selling high is much simpler than what it is. A person who looks at this chart usually says,
we'll come up with an excuse of why equities should go higher and how much should go lower.
In fact, the usual reason that people use looking at this mark and this chart to claim that is to
say, well, look, you could have set that in 2014, 2015, and it kept going lower. And that's certainly
the case. I think it's all about risk reward. How much risk are you taking versus how much reward
is there? And when I think about what's happening in the market, especially in the gold space,
to me, the gold, understanding the gold market is almost understanding your views about inflation.
Those are fundamental questions to then invest. And the reason why I'm so bullish on gold,
well, there are plenty. Recently, let's just talk about what's going on recently. Gold is surging in
prices. Everyone is trying to understand what's happening. And then they go look at the ETF, GLD,
the most liquid ETF in the world. They go there and they realize that the assets under management
of the ETF are declining as gold makes new high. Well, the ETF itself is designed to go up when
gold prices go up. So it's doing what it's supposed to do. But general investors are not deploying
capital into the ETF. Therefore, you're seeing a decline of assets under management. It begs the
question then, what's going on? How is gold going up? Well, the main reason for that is because
central banks are probably buying gold. And gold used to be 75% of central bank assets back in the
'70s and '80s. And then we went through our central banks, those institutions went through a buying
spree of treasuries and other sovereign institutions. And now gold is less than 20%
of their assets. And so when you think about inflation staying higher for longer,
monetary debasement being a big theme, what does that cause? That cause monetary instability. And
ultimately that drives central banks to buy gold. And that's what we're seeing. We're seeing record
amounts of central banks buying gold. So the big question now would be, is that sustainable? Will
they keep that going? And the answer for me is probably, because they used to own, in average,
used to be 40% of their assets used to be gold. And today is less than 20%. So they can double
what they currently own of their assets in that. And so to me, that's an important value proposition
for the metal. The second one that I would point out is, here is a chart that shows that well,
is what's going on with 60/40 portfolios. I mean, 60/40 portfolios are probably one of the most
traditional ways of allocate capital. And we often hear about them because it worked really well,
and it's reflected in this. So basically in this white line, you're just seeing
what is the cost of a valuation of a 60/40 portfolio. So I'm looking at the earnings yield.
So the lower the line goes, the more expensive it gets, the higher it goes. It actually provides
more earnings yield, so it's cheaper. And so you can see that you have this big trends. It's going
back to the 1893, so centuries of data. And you can see clearly here that those big secular trends
were probably just reached one of them actually at the very bottom of that, which was the lowest
yield in 130 years. And I'm using 40% weight on US treasuries and then 60% weight on S&P 500
earnings yield. So we've had a repricing in the treasury side, but not really a repricing on the
equity side. And so it begs the question again, will traditional portfolios look more like this,
60/40s in 10 years from now, or will they be more balanced and maybe have 5% of gold, 2%, 3% of
Bitcoin? I don't know, 2% of silver or whatever. Usually the best way to understand what the
tendency is of investors doing something, watch what central banks do. Those big institutions
tend to kind of follow what central banks do. In fact, that's what happened with treasuries.
We went through one of the longest declining interest rate environments in history because
central banks have started to buy sovereign debt and then large institutions, pension funds,
and so forth have started to buy that too. And I think we're going to go to something similar,
but on the gold side, and I'm not claiming gold is going to be 40% of the portfolio,
but when you see this last chart real quick, which is US treasuries versus gold, and you can see
clearly in this chart, it's the first time in 45 years that treasuries have a higher volatility
than gold. Probably central banks are not prioritizing volatility necessarily in this case,
but I would think that most of those traditional portfolios that want protection to their
portfolios are probably going to be looking at this in a few years and say, yeah, let's probably
need a little bit more gold. Again, I don't think it will be 40% of a portfolio, but I don't think
it will be zero. And today that's the case. Now, most allocators own 0% of gold. I don't have
another chart here, but there was another important chart that I can show later that shows the
allocation of gold across most financial advisors today, which is basically 0% of them own 10% or
more, which is crazy. Back in the '70s, that used to be a normal thing to own 10% of gold.
So obviously, you said earlier that central banks are holding about 20% in gold and they used to
hold more like 40. You're saying that the retail investor used to hold somewhere up to 10% and now
own zero pretty much on average. So if central banks were to buy more, I was going to ask you
when you mentioned that they could theoretically bring it up to 40, probably not, but they could
increase what they have. But theoretically, if they increase it to 40, what would that do to the gold
price? I think it would probably dramatically accelerate it. And what would happen if retail
portfolios went from zero to even 2%? That would probably overwhelm the gold market as well, too.
I don't have the chart here. If you give me a second, I'll get you a chart.
But here it is. I did the calculation that you just asked, essentially. So if you look at the
global central bank history of holdings of gold, and here is 1970s all the way to 2023.
And you can see here that back in the '70s used to be well above 45% or so. And then we saw this
declining trend, which was caused by some central banks selling gold and others buying sovereign
debt. And US Treasury issued a ton of debt during that period. Other central banks purchased
Treasuries. In fact, the most credible monetary systems in the world, just a few years ago,
were the ones that held a bunch of US Treasuries, because that used to be the most credible
and lowest volatility instrument you could own in the world. That has changed. That was that change,
that pivotal moment that we saw back in the COVID era or post-COVID era is what's changed
that the profile and the risk that is associated with owning Treasuries. And so you asked the
question, how much would that add? Well, look, it would be about $3.2 trillion. But keep in mind
that they're also increasing the size of their overall balance sheet. So they'd increase the
size of the balance sheet. I'll give you an example. PBOC, since September, increased their
balance sheet by $840 billion, almost a trillion dollars increase. This is not anywhere in a Wall
Street Journal. I don't see anybody talking about this. It is a real bazooka of monetary stimulus
that we're seeing from the PBOC. The time to be short China, the time to be bearish on China was
five years ago. Not now. They are printing money like there's no tomorrow. And so I get concerned
about that because I think that's translating into higher gold prices as well. That's one way to
kind of think about that. And so it would add about $3.2 trillion in central bank
purchases if we see them going back to this 40% average. Now, let me bring another point because--
All right. And sorry to interrupt, but what is the current size of
the gold market? I hear it oftentimes like $7 or $8 trillion.
Well, that's a good point. So I think right now it's between, it might be $13 or $12 trillion,
but the more important data is that since October, everyone talks, I mean, especially the
crypto community. I have nothing against the crypto community, by the way, but usually they
like to talk about how Bitcoin is going to eclipse gold, right? That's been one of the main points
of a lot of the Bitcoiners out there. Now, think about this. Gold, since October, increased its
value by about $2 trillion, okay? Since October, $2 trillion is twice the size of Bitcoin. It's
the entire crypto market. It is a whole Nvidia. And so, you know, it's just to give you some
perspective, yes, from an appreciation perspective, I wouldn't expect being rich buying gold. Like
this new generation that is so speculative that they want to make money tomorrow,
they probably won't be attracted to gold. That's not what the community of investors would be
attracted by. Who buys gold is usually a central bank that is looking for something solid that has,
you know, centuries of history of being a credible way of improving the quality of your reserves.
And also some of those 60/40 portfolios that are looking for a protective asset. And so
those are going to be probably the higher demand pools of capital that will be chasing gold,
first and foremost. Now, where I get excited, almost as excited as usually the younger
generation does with other things, is that it's hard to believe that we're going to see such
an important appreciation of gold prices, regardless if, even if it's double from here,
let's just call it double, you know, in the next 10 years. How do you think a mining company would
be trading? How would that be re-rated as a business? How much would that change the,
you know, what would be the appreciation of the market cap of a business that is in the business
of mining gold or silver or copper? And what would the gold to silver ratio be if we have that?
Would that be 90? Would silver really be trading at $20 an ounce or would it be trading at 50?
And if I'm buying a project today that produces silver, should I be thinking about that? And
hypothetically, how would this economics of this business look like if silver is at 50?
That's kind of where my mindset is. You know, I'm trying to think about this,
you know, how would everything look like if we have a world where gold is, you know,
significantly higher from here, silver is pushed higher because I've never seen gold move higher
substantially that is not driven by silver. And then ultimately what happens with all this
distress opportunities that are really high quality in some cases that nobody that is just
being neglected for so long and completely unloved. And so, you know, I've, maybe I can
attract some of the younger crowd to the space, but it's, to me, this is where, you know, I don't
go to a restaurant or a bar and I hear people talking about their, you know, acquiring claims
and properties and all sorts of things to look for minerals. And, you know, to me, I think at
the end of this decade, I think maybe this idea will look a little more obvious than what it is
currently. All right. Fantastic. All right. Well, look, Tavi, we're going to have to wrap it up at
that. I think it's a great point to end this on because if indeed this is the trajectory we
continue going on, I'm going to want to have you back on the program many times in the future to
update folks as to sort of where we are in the story and where you're seeing in which sectors,
the real opportunity at any given moment in time. But, you know, what you've sort of laid for us
here is that gold is at the vanguard, hopefully of driving the rest of the commodity complex higher.
It's got a very bright future for all the reasons that you just mentioned here. And, you know,
you're very excited about the deep values that the precious metals miners offer right now. I want to
just let folks know that if you didn't watch or participate in the Thoughtful Money conference
from a week ago, we had two great mining analysts. So one, the legendary Rick Rule,
and also Jeff Clark. Both of them shared their top picks right now in the precious metals mining
space. Rick also shared a bunch of other names and a bunch of other commodity sectors as well.
But if you are intrigued by what inspired by what Tavi has mentioned here, and you're looking for
ideas, that's one resource you can use. And if you didn't attend the conference, you can still
buy the replay videos over at ThoughtfulMoney.com/conference. All right, well, Tavi,
look, in wrapping up here, I didn't get time to get to and I don't want to do short shrift,
but which is, you know, what are some of the other commodity complexes that you're really excited
about? We'll have you back on to go into those in depth here. For folks that have really enjoyed
your analysis here, I'm sure once they saw some of your charts here, they were like,
"Oh, this is the guy who does those charts. I know this guy." Where can they follow you and
your work going forward? You can follow my work on Twitter @TaviCosta or also on our website,
cresca.net. You can find a bunch of research there as well that we put out. But I appreciate
the invite to be part of this and congrats, Adam, on your new endeavors. I'm happy for you.
Oh, gosh. Well, it's such a pleasure. Huge fan, Tavi, big privilege to have you on here.
Real quick, I've got one last question I'm going to ask you and I'm going to give you
about 45 seconds to think about it. And I didn't prep you on this. So this is a curveball.
We've been talking all about commodities in the context of making money, preserving financial
wealth. What's one non-money related investment that you would encourage folks to adopt in their
lives? So chew on that for 45 seconds. Folks, if you would indeed like Tavi to come back on
when he's got another important update for us in this whole commodity sector, please let him know
by hitting the like button and then clicking on the red subscribe button below, as well as that
little bell icon right next to it. And Tavi has sort of mentioned this arc of potential
bull cycle in commodities. You might have even heard some people refer to it as a coming super
cycle in commodities. And obviously, if the chart that he showed earlier about how undervalued they
are right now relative to equities, if that starts getting back even to its historic mean,
that's going to be a pretty massive move. So if you're trying to figure out ways in which you
might want to increase exposure to your portfolio about that and ways to play that commodity space,
there can be lots of opportunity there. But if you don't know what you're doing,
you can also lose your shirt pretty fast. Anybody that's held some of these precious metals mining
shares that Tavi and I have been talking about, especially in the more junior stage,
they've got the scars to prove it. So highly recommend if you think that you want to start
getting involved in the space, especially if you have no experience in it, work under the guidance
of a good professional financial advisor who takes into account all the macro topics that Tavi and I
talked about here and that the regular guests on this channel and I talked about, but also has
experience investing in these sectors. If you've got a good one who's doing that for you, great,
stick with them. But if you don't, or you'd like to get a second opinion from one who does,
feel free to talk to one of the advisors that Thoughtful Money endorses. These are the ones
that you see every week with me on this channel. To set up one of those free consultations,
just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com, fill out the short form there. You'll get bespoke,
personally customized advice from them. There's no cost to these consultations. There's no commitment
to work with them. It's just a free public service that they offer. All right, Tavi,
we're now back to you. What is one non-monetary investment that you'd encourage folks to consider?
Well, I think it's to seek truth through having independent views. I mean, that's kind of been my
mode of analysis and mode of living life has been really not trying to be, you know,
strongly politically weighted on anything and always being very open-minded to ideas.
I think that has been serving me well in my life, and I hope to be that way as much as possible. I
have a young daughter now, and I hope that I can teach her how to do that as well. To have a very
independent view and being forced to respect other opinions, but also really try to seek the truth
rather than what is perceived as being the truth. It's not an easy task. It sounds easier than what
it is. I mean, it's really driving your curiosity, whatever. If it's money related, then it really is
understanding markets and looking at real data rather than just reading newspapers and the news.
A lot of times what I do, even from a work perspective, is reading news and the data and
really trying to drive my own analysis, my own view, and then seeing other analysts views about
that certain topic. It's interesting how the more you do that, the more you understand the market
because you become more curious and not just a market, but a topic in general. You start creating
some really interesting opinions that a lot of people have never heard of because it's truly
being independently driven. I've always been of the view that independent opinions is very
rare to find in markets. Analysts, when you look for analysts to work for you or all sorts of
things, rarely they have very independent views. If you think about most of the successful people
in the world, they're really good at having their own opinions on things and they're usually seeking
the truth and not just to be right on an argument with your friends, but really trying to
be to finding what's the right answer for something. To me, that's something I really enjoy
kind of to live by. That's an excellent answer, Tavi. I'm honestly kind of surprised. I've been
doing this for over two months now and nobody's brought that one up yet and I think that's
super valuable in general, but certainly in the space of being an analyst. This ability
to keep an open mind. There's a famous axiom and I'm sure I'm murdering it, but it's something
like the sign of an educated mind is the ability to keep two opposing ideas in your head at the
same time and be cognizant that your position might be the wrong one, the other might be right,
or that the truth may lie somewhere in between the two. It's so challenging in the modern
environment with digital media where it's so easy for us to construct a really comfortable
perfect little echo chamber that just tells us what we want to hear all the time and validate
our way of thinking. Super important to get yourself out of that and to make sure that you are
always challenging what you feel so strongly about with hopefully well-informed or
well-constructed arguments to the opposite so that you are always keeping
your overconfidence in check and to your point, hopefully dialing in more on the truth. So
thank you for that. I love that. All right, Tavi. Well, look, wonderful as always. Sorry the clock
ran out on us here. We'll definitely have you back on again in the future and anytime that you see
something materially happening in the commodity markets that you want to get more widely
appreciated, please come back on this channel. Thanks for having me. I really appreciate that.
Thank you. All right, such a pleasure. And folks, if you enjoyed this,
again, hit that like button. Tavi, thanks so much. Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
Bye.
