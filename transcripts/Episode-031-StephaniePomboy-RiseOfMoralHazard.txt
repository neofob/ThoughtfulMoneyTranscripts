Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. Greed and Exuberance
returned to Wall Street as we ended 2023 and welcomed the start of 2024. Markets are trading
near all-time highs, the Fed has switched to singing a more dubbish tune, and confidence in a
soft landing or even a no landing for the economy is high. Did we manage to emerge from all the chaos
and distortion of the past few years without a major reckoning? Have we dodged the bullet of
recession? For answers, we're lucky to talk today with top Thoughtful Money fan favorite
Stephanie Pomboy, economic and financial analyst and publisher of the respected research firm
Macro Mavens. Stephanie, it's wonderful to have you back on the program. Thanks so much for joining us
today. Thanks, Adam. Happy New Year. Hey, same to you. Congratulations. This is my debut on Thoughtful
Money. I know, and I got to tell you, Stephanie, not a day has gone by since I launched the program
that I haven't been bombarded with questions of when is Stephanie coming on?
Thank you so much for coming on and hopefully shielding me for at least a little while
from that barrage. Look, lots to catch up on since we last talked. I am very interested to see if
your macro outlook has changed at all since we last talked, which was back in, I think, October-ish,
because as I just said in the intro, there's a lot of green shoots that a lot of people are
pointing to, and I'm curious if you think those are real and outlook changing, or if maybe they're
just providing some false signals right now. But before we get into the details of that,
can we just start with my regular broad question I like to kick these discussions off with?
What's your current assessment of the global economy in financial markets?
Well, I guess my answer to that question is going to get into the question of the green shoots and
the shift in tone from the Fed, because as you know, throughout our discussions last year,
I was just emphatic on the idea that the impact of the higher rates was going to be felt. And just
because it hadn't happened yet didn't mean it wasn't going to happen. And everything I looked
at in terms of the enormous leverage that had been built up really since the global financial crisis
and then took off, really exploded after COVID, suggested that there was tremendous vulnerability
to the increase in interest rates, and it was just a matter of time before that became evident. And
in fact, we did see the largest number of corporate bankruptcies since the global financial crisis
outside of COVID last year. And we've obviously seen a huge increase in consumer delinquencies
as well and commercial real estate, et cetera. And bank failures too.
And bank failures, exactly. And yet, if you were a man from Mars coming down and looking at the
financial markets at the end of 2023, you would have had zero inkling that all of these rate hikes
had really taken place. I mean, credit spreads actually impossibly narrowed even as all these
delinquencies and defaults materialized. So I was puzzling throughout the year as I watched this
enthusiasm for risk assets in the face of deteriorating credit quality as to how long
this was going to be sustainable. And it seemed to me like people picking up that proverbial picking
up the nickels in front of the steamroller. And then Powell made with his dovish talk
after the last Fed conference. And I guess my takeaway from that was he's basically ratifying
the market expectations. The markets all year refused to hear what the Fed was saying about
hire for longer and priced in rate cuts and were therefore willing to continue to extend credit to
struggling over levered enterprises because they assumed that those struggling over levered
enterprises would be made whole basically as the Fed cut rates and their debt service went back to
what they perceived to be a more normal manageable level. So long story short, everyone was all in on
this idea that the higher rates were a temporary phenomenon that would quickly reverse. So they all
made that bet. Banks continued to lend, capital markets flung the doors open.
And so where I am now, there's a very long winded way to answer your question about my macro view
is we're really in this kind of no man's land. I call it like a purgatory. We don't know
really where we're going. We're in limbo because while the fundamentals are still,
the backdrop is still incredibly negative. We still have all this leverage built up from the
government to corporate sectors, to consumers, et cetera. And that debt is rolling at higher rates.
However, if the markets and lenders are willing to be accommodative on the expectation that things
are going to get better, that expectation has the power to create the reality.
There's a reflexivity there. Yeah.
Right. Just as we saw all of last year, even as corporate bankruptcy is piled up, private credit,
banks, everyone were willing to go out there and extend credit. So I'm now kind of
having schooled in the degree to which perception can become the reality.
And so the struggle for me is that, yes, fundamentally, the backdrop is still incredibly
negative. But if hope continues to spring eternal and the Fed does maintain this sort of more dovish
posture and ultimately deliver on the rate hikes, maybe the crisis-
Even with the cuts. Sorry.
I'm sorry. Sorry. Rape cuts. Boy. Maybe the crisis will in fact be averted. I mean,
my heart isn't in that thesis. I think that it's still, I'd like to believe in the triumph of the
fundamentals. And unfortunately, I've been waiting for that triumph for a long time and it's not
materialized. And I also, from the standpoint of actually finally cleansing the excesses that have
been built up in our system for decades now, would really look forward to a credit bust
and a deep recession that finally expunged all these excesses and we could start fresh and start
from a really good, solid, fundamental foundation. Much as I imagine that will happen, and that's
still my main view, I've been humbled enormously over the last year by the power of expectations.
So I'm really, right now, as a cop-out maybe, sitting in cash on the sidelines because again,
you're still now getting 5% to wait and see how this flushes out and whether the Fed can deliver
the rape cuts the market anticipates soon enough, which is crucial, and aggressively enough to really
stave off a meaningful wave of bankruptcies on the corporate side and delinquencies on the consumer
side. Boy, that was so long-winded and I don't know if it answered your question.
No, it provided exactly the context of wanting to know where you are right now and I share a lot of
your feelings. I'm sure a lot of our viewers do too. I want to dig into a couple of things around
this, if we can. One, I want to talk about the role of liquidity and how you've seen that impact
the system here. I've talked to a number of people relatively recently who believe that that has been
a key factor here in pushing off recession, supporting markets, juicing economic growth,
basically keeping things better for longer, if you will, economically speaking.
I think there's maybe some differing views amongst that camp for how sustainable that liquidity wave
will be. There are some like Michael Howe who thinks it's going to continue for the next two
years and we're going to have a great two years in the economy and the markets going forward.
Other folks not quite as confident. I also talked to Wolf Richter, who I think you would probably
find to be somewhat of a kindred spirit where he basically said, "Look, we need a recession."
He's like, "I totally think we need one for a lot of the reasons you just mentioned."
He said, "But I'm looking at the data and I don't see it coming anytime soon and I got to call it
as I see it." I'm curious, when you talk about us being in limbo right now, are we in limbo
and you just really don't know how it's going to end up right now and so you're just still
kind of casting around for clarity? Or is it limbo where we're kind of sometimes markets can grind
sideways for a long time before they start coming up again? Maybe it's this rolling recession that
people talk about where we're not going to really net fall into a recession economically, but parts
of it will weaken. But overall, we're just going to move sideways until things can continue moving
higher. Or is this kind of like an interim period where it's like eating your seed corn. In the
wintertime, it's eating your seed corn or it's burning your furniture to stay warm. When you're
doing those two things, you're warm and fed, but you are basically ruining your future prospects.
At some point, you've eaten the last year seed corn and then there's no food left or you burn
the last stick of furniture and you got nothing to sit on after that. Which of those three outcomes
feels more accurate to you right now? Well, I guess the last one, to the extent that,
let's say, for example, you had companies that had borrowed at 4% last year during the, let's say,
COVID stimulus extravaganza when rates were flat on the mat. They had to roll that paper at 8%
last year and that became a little onerous. So in came private credit lenders who said,
"You know what? We'll take that paper off here. We'll lend to you at six and a half," or whatever
the magic number was. That sustained them. But in the process, they're still massively levered
and unless their fundamental business model turns around, they're still in the situation.
It's like you're saying, with the seed corn, essentially, they bought themselves a little
more time. They burned through a little more capital in the hope that everything's going to
be better in the near future. So it's a monster bet. And what if the economy actually doesn't
improve and we don't see that increase in earnings that everyone's anticipating? I think S&P earnings
are still forecast to grow 12% or something this year. And those numbers are starting to come down
a little bit, but they're still high in the sky. So a lot of it will turn on that. The other thing
that I'm trying to wrap my head around right now is, and leaves me even more uncertain and in my
own mental limbo about where we're going, is this prospect that maybe we're in a new situation where
consumers are essentially going on strike as relates to paying their debts. We have created
a culture of moral hazard on Wall Street, but I think we're starting to see it on Main Street
as well. And a couple of things made me think about this as a theme. And that is, obviously,
the student loan payments kicked back in in October. But the nonpayment rate, from what
I've read, is very high. A lot of students, former students who are trying to pay those debts,
have concluded they threw up their hands. And they're basically saying, I don't understand
what I need to pay and what I need to pay. And they're basically just not making the payments.
There's also a stat on, we have a record federal income tax nonpayment right now,
which is amazing to me. I mean, it's one thing not to pay your student loan debts or your credit
card debts or whatever, but to not pay your taxes. So it seems to me like we might be creating a
cultural shift where consumers, maybe because Biden suggested he was going to forgive student
loan debt, even though it was unconstitutional, and then continued to try to push for it after
the fact, maybe people are thinking, hey, it's OK if I get in over my head on my credit card or
my auto loan or whatever, because they'll forgive that next. So I mean, I'm not sure if this is
happening, but I do see hints that maybe there is a little bit of this cultural shift taking place.
And that's kind of terrifying. It's such an interesting-- I'm so glad you brought this up,
because I think I've touched upon elements of this over the past couple of years on this channel and
its predecessor. And you and I have even talked a little bit about this. Homeowners got bailed out
coming out of the 2007 housing crisis. Obviously, everybody famously knows how Wall Street's been
bailed out. We bailed out households during COVID. There's the direct checks to households. We had all
these forbearance programs. I think you're right. I think it's understandable to question, have we
built a culture of moral hazard here? And I just looked up the stat while you were talking there.
40% of people have not made payments on their student loans since they went back into repayment.
So that's getting close to half. That's not an insignificant percentage. And so I don't think
it's too large of a stretch, as you're presuming, where people would just say, well, wait a minute.
If I don't have to really pay my student loan debt, why should I pay my car payment if it's
tough this month? Why should I pay my credit card company? And also, as you and I have talked about,
we're creating this kind of class warfare, where if you didn't have student loan debt
and that's being forgiven for your neighbor, you're saying, well, screw that. Maybe I won't
pay my credit card debt. Why should they get away without paying debts? And I'm sitting here being
responsible. So it may very well extend beyond the student loan thing and create this kind of
cultural sense of I'm not responsible. Absolutely. And that's the Pandora's box that intervention
opens, is when you start basically playing favorites to a certain extent. You're saying,
OK, this class here, I'm going to give relief for whatever reason. And maybe it's well-intentioned.
But you unleash the sort of domino effect of people basically saying, well, why not me?
Where does this end? Does this end with embracing MMT and just, hey, you know--
That's the question, is if that's true-- and this is why I'm so much in this mental limbo
right now. I mean, we've got, in the corporate sector, the prospect of a real corporate credit
bust, which I had been forecasting for a long time, being forestalled by this anticipation
of lower rates. And therefore, banks and non-bank lenders just continuing to shovel money to sustain
those enterprises. So we've got that on the one hand. And then on the consumer front, where you
would think, well, they don't have access to private credit and capital markets or whatnot,
they're going to get screwed as rates go up. And I mean, we've seen credit card borrowing explode
into 23% credit card rates. Yeah, all-time high APRs, yeah.
It doesn't make sense. Normally, borrowing and interest rates don't really move together. When
rates go up, people stop borrowing. It's like getting slapped on the wrist.
And it's been the opposite this time. So it does make you think that maybe people are saying,
look, it doesn't matter how much I borrow. I never am going to have to pay it back.
And if that's the case, you continue to see defaults or delinquencies on the consumer credit
side. So I guess the rubber meets the road when banks and these other lenders find they're not
getting paid back. And then that becomes a big enough problem that it's a systemic issue,
at which point you can bet that the Fed or someone is going to come in with some kind of bailout.
But in the interim, what it's doing is sustaining consumption in the face of what normally would
have been a fundamental backdrop that would have seen consumer spending much weaker than it is now.
I will argue, however, and you've heard me argue this many times before, that consumer spending,
while it's held up well, is not nearly as good as it looks. First, because when you look at retail
sales, it's not deflated. So it's entirely, in fact, I think inflation is 3-1 and retail sales
were up 3-1 year on year. So there's no growth in retail sales in real terms. And that actually has
been the case since March of 2022, the months when the Fed started raising rates. So in essence,
consumers aren't buying more stuff. They're just buying the same amount of stuff and paying more.
It's just costing more, yeah.
Yeah. It's an inflation illusion of strength, but in reality, they're not buying more stuff.
However, you would think they'd actually be buying less stuff because you're now seeing a
slowdown in employment and their debt service costs are back relative to income to the highest
level since the global financial crisis. And so they have real pressures at the same time,
the basic bare necessities of life, while they're not going up as rapidly in price,
are still at a very high price level.
Right. And way higher than they were just two years ago, yeah.
Exactly. So you would think all those things would conspire to see them actually cutting
back expenditure and that hasn't happened yet. And perhaps it has something to do with this culture of
non repayment of debts.
All right. So I want to dig into that just a little bit more. I've got a bunch of questions
about the economy and where you see things headed. So we'll get to those in a second. But
this is just a really important vein and I sense that we're going to talk about it more in the
future. You know, what's interesting culturally is we are, when you look in aggregate, right,
is we, I don't know the right way to say this, but like we see as like belt tightening as like
a hardship that is beyond the pale, right? That no matter what happens, I still need to be able
to afford my thousand dollar smartphone and all my streaming subscriptions and still got to take that
vacation and all that type of stuff. And one thing that kind of made me reflect on this was I just
saw the movie The Boys in the Boat. Oh, I'm dying to see that.
Okay. So great story. Cinderella story, a depression era men's crew team from
University of Washington, underdog player made up largely of young men from depression ever families
where like literally the main character is rowing on the team because that's the only way he can get
a dependable meal, right? But they end up beating all the Ivy League schools and then they end up
going to the Olympics in Germany that year. But the main character, and this was I'm sure the
Hollywood manufactured drama, but his sort of wound is that his father left the family when
he was 14 and kind of left him on his own because the father had to go find work in California,
right? And then this guy who's now in college bumps into his father in Washington and surprise,
his father's been actually back in town, hadn't reached out. And his father says,
"Well, what do you want from me?" And the guy says, "Well, look dad, I was 14 years old when
you left and left me on my own." And the dad says, "What do you want from me? When I was 14,
I was sent to war." Right? And it's just a reminder of like not that many generations ago,
like life wasn't really pretty tough for a lot of people, right? And this is still in the 20th
century, right? Like you go back another century or two and talk to somebody who was lived in Russia
and died by the millions or whatever, right? Like we're at the point now where like, again,
having to consider giving up my smartphone is like just an unacceptable beyond the pale sacrifice
that of course nobody could ever make and the government should step in and make sure that I'm
bailed out so that I can continue to do all this stuff, right? You're just sort of nodding sadly.
But the reason why I kind of tell that story is to your point, like we are increasingly, I think,
becoming a populace that says things hurt, give me relief, right? And I think we have
seems an increasing amount of politicians, central planners who are willing to say,
"Yes, I will do that for you. That's my job and maybe I'm doing it as well because I
hope you'll vote for me next time around." And where does this end? That is obviously
not sustainable. And we end up in a way worse position in the long-term, I believe,
because we basically pulled tomorrow's prosperity into today, trying to pay for things that aren't
affordable or sustainable and that everybody is faced with fewer options than they otherwise
would have when the end of the road arrives. Do you have to share the same concern?
Yeah. Well, absolutely. And I think you are now bringing me to the one thing about which I have
certainty in 2024. Given everything I laid out at the top being in this sort of economic limbo,
the one thing that seems absolutely clear to me as we look at the federal debt hitting $34 trillion,
that the dollar is going to pay the price for our monetary and fiscal policy since
big time this year, that we're already seeing the dollar decline on the expectation that the Fed is
going to pivot, really accelerated its decline after Powell's very dovish FOMC. And this is just
the cyclical force driving the dollar lower. It's just based on Fed rate cuts. And the prospect,
I would say that they are going to cut rates despite the economy not being in recession
and the markets not being catastrophic. So, it's essentially going to be an immaculate
rate cut or an immaculate easing cycle. To me, that is the most egregious
monetary debauchery you could ever contemplate. And it seems nakedly political
as we head into an election year, especially at a time when, as yet anyway, the inflation
picture has not come anywhere near to where the Fed really wants it. I mean, sure, you can look at
three months rate of change of the super core or whatever number you want to look at. But as we
talked about earlier, the average guy on Main Street only knows that his cost of living went
through the roof and is now getting slightly less, getting more userious at a slightly
less rapid pace. So, there's been no relief on the inflation front for Main Street. And meanwhile,
Wall Street and the Fed look at the drop in the CPI from nine to three and declare victory and
imagine that now it's time to provide relief from all of this oppressive higher interest rates.
So, to me, the valve for all of this ends will be the dollar. And again, I've just articulated
the cyclical side of that back on the heels of this Fed shift to easing after tightening.
But you're layering that on top of a secular backdrop for the dollar that's been very bearish
for a long time, but particularly so after COVID when you have these and after the weaponization of
dollar reserves with the sanctioning of Russia after their invasion of the Ukraine,
that really was a line in the sand. And you've seen a lot of countries accelerate the diversification
away from the dollar and the BRICS plus nations coming together more meaningfully in terms of
cobbling together trade agreements and local currencies and trying to find avenues around
the dollar. And I think that this shift in the Fed will greatly accelerate those efforts.
And so, I think that the trade for 2024, or at least the only trade about which I feel confident,
is that you're going to see the dollar much lower. And obviously, the mirror image of that would be
gold and other precious metals. So, that's the one thing where I feel like, okay, I can sit in
5% cash, I can have my gold, I can own some long dated treasuries and just watch and see how this
all plays out. And if the Fed really does pursue an immaculate rate cut, but if they don't, that
secular story of the de-dollarization is still going on. And this is going farther down the
field maybe than you want to on this. But this year's BRICS summit meeting is being held in
Russia. Last year, it was in South Africa. And because of Putin being a war criminal,
he wasn't able to go to South Africa, lest he be extradited. So, he couldn't be in attendance.
Obviously, he can be in attendance at the summit this year in Russia in October. And it would make
for the perfect time and location for he and she and the other BRICS nations to announce some kind
of progress on a joint currency. So, I just think that's a probability. But even if that doesn't
happen, you're certain to see an acceleration in this de-dollarization, thanks to the Fed's
pivot here. Okay. And sorry, do you see the announcement that you were talking about as a
probability or do you see it as a possibility like a wild card? They're probably working on something
and at some point they'll announce it. Or do you think, "Hey, odds are really good it's going to be
announced this summer?" I think odds are good. I don't know that I'd say I'm 100% expecting them
to do it, but a lot of us expected them to do it in South Africa and were disappointed that they
didn't come together with a statement then. But it does seem to me reasonable that Putin would have
wanted to be in attendance and be one of the primary authors, let's say, of this announcement.
So, it's a perfect photo op. But when you look at what's happening behind the scenes
in terms of the shift away from our treasury market and these moves to cobble together trade
deals- Lots of trade deals that are not in dollars, yeah. Yeah, every day there's an announcement.
And obviously, Russia has already completely sold its treasury stock. I don't hold zero treasuries
anymore. So, it's not even like it's not buying as many. It's completely liquidated its treasury
holdings and been working. I think they and China trade almost exclusively in local currencies now.
They're not using the dollar for trade. So, the announcement will be more symbolic
than anything else, but it will be important symbolism for the West. I mean, I think everyone
in the BRICS nations understands that this is happening and they're serious about it.
It's the policymakers in the West, the Fed, Congress, the administration,
who seem to have their blinders on and imagine that there is no challenge to US hegemony,
and they can therefore pursue these wanton monetary and fiscal policies forever, and there'll
be no repercussion to that. And I think this year might change that complacency a little bit.
Okay. So, since you mentioned gold, I just got to ask you,
it sounds like you think it's going to perform well, period, for the reasons you talked about,
the sort of standard dollar down, gold up reasons. Obviously, if there's a new BRICS currency that is
denominated in gold grams, which is sort of what the rumor is, that'd probably be quite gold
positive as well. Technically, if you look at gold, it's back trading very close to all-time
highs now. And people debate whether this is a real technical pattern or not, but you have this
sort of like decade old cup and handle that's been building with a triple top on the handle,
and we're now back up at that breakout point. I'm assuming you think this could be a real
breakout year for gold for a number of the reasons you mentioned and maybe a few others,
but are you expecting it to be like a big year, where gold breaks through its price ceiling and
then maybe runs by a couple of hundred bucks an ounce? Yeah. I think it will be a big year.
I mean, if you go back and look at past easing cycles, if we assume that the Fed is now embarking
on a full-fledged easing cycle, gold should go up dramatically. I mean, could it be 3,000 by the end
of the year? I wouldn't be surprised. That's aggressive relative to what most people who are
bullish on gold are looking for. But to me, that's kind of a slam dunk. I do silly things. I look at
what would be the price on gold at which we fully backed the monetary base in the United States.
I mean, if you went and looked at that- Those numbers are silly, but yeah.
Right. It's 10 times the current level. So, we're 21,000 just to back the monetary base.
Now, that's just an intellectual exercise, but it illustrates how feeble our gold reserve is
relative to the amount of money that we have printed over these last several decades.
And compared to a lot of countries around the world, even though we have the largest gold
reserve next to Europe, relative to the amount of money we printed, it's a drop in the bucket.
And then you've got countries like Russia, where the amount of gold that they hold,
albeit much smaller than ours, covers 50% of their monetary base. So, there's really no comparison.
If they ever did challenge the US and say, "Look, we're going to back our currency with gold. What
are you going to do?" We'd really be hard pressed to compete with that. So, I think gold, there are
a lot of reasons to imagine that gold should go substantially higher in price. And that's before
contemplating the prospect that we actually do have the credit bust that I've been forecasting
forever. And the Fed not only has to undertake a typical easing cycle, but has to be far more
aggressive and then stop and eventually reverse QT and start re-expanding its balance sheet.
And you and I have talked at length about if we had a massive credit bust and a financial
deflation, the amount of money that would have to be printed to backstop the public pension system,
which is in the multiple trillions. So, if you tack that onto the Fed's balance sheet,
we're looking at a 12, 15 trillion dollar balance sheet before all is said and done. So,
that's not going to be bullish for the dollar either, but it should be tremendously bullish
for gold. So, I see a lot of upside for gold. And as yet, it's not like anyone's
actively in there. You don't talk to a lot of retail or hedge fund investors who are out there
saying, "Hey, I'm all in on gold." It's still relatively, let's say unpopular on Wall Street,
although it's becoming more popular on Main Street. I'm sure you've seen the articles about
Costco and Walmart selling gold. And I know Costco for one couldn't keep inventory of it.
So, there seems to be some growing interest in it. We'll see.
All right. We'll see. I do have pensions on my list of questions.
I'm going to guess we're not going to get to it just because I have so many other funds
before we get there. All right. So, you talked about inflation. Let's dig into that just for
a moment here because in previous conversations, when we were really looking at the debt overhang,
we were looking at the maturity wave that was coming up for corporate America,
we were expecting higher for longer. And you and I, I think, have been respectors of the lag
effect. And so, we have expected that as we've moved through the timeline here, the lag effect
would continue to become more and more of a visible issue. It hasn't been in many ways,
and we've talked about some of the reasons why, liquidity being a big one, to the point where I
think a lot of people are now dismissing it. Hey, the Fed's been able to finesse this, that we've
just been able to make it different this time. Which makes me even more confident that it's
about to happen. But because of the belief in the lag effect, if I'm remembering correctly,
you were saying, look, I think we're going to switch from worrying about inflation in 2023
to really worrying about deflation, negative deflation in 2024. And you've talked a lot
about how there's historical precedent in past cycles where we went from like 5% CPI to like
negative 2% in the span of a quarter or two. So, I'm curious if that's still your default
expectation for 2024, or if you think for a lot of the reasons we talked about, that's slowing that
process down. And I'm just curious, do you have any concerns that if the Fed is pivoting too early
here, it's basically going to embark on a more stimulative type policy when the economy is
doing just fine. Do we risk an Arthur Burns moment here where all of a sudden the inflationary
spirits resume here and all of a sudden the Fed has to backtrack?
Yeah. Well, I'm glad you laid it out that way because my deflation or disinflation thesis has
always been a function of asset price deflation, fueling goods and services price deflation.
I never thought inflation in the economy would suddenly decelerate absent of correction in the
markets and a reverse wealth effect that would be associated with that. So, now that we're possibly
taking that off the table by the Fed pumping money into the system before the crisis happens,
it does change my outlook for inflation. Now, I'm not one of these who thinks we're headed into some
hyperinflation and we're going back to 9%, but could we sit at 3% for a while and defy the Fed's
expectation that inflation is going to quickly come down to its target? I think that's a very
high possibility, especially when you lay on two things that I was just looking at. Well, one
that we all know or are aware of and that is that given what's happening in the Mideast,
you've got shipping issues and you have the prospect again of supply chain disruption
that will continue to put upward pressure on input costs and to some extent feed through
possibly to the CPI. But whatever that is, you're going to have more commodity and shipping and basic
input price pressures. And then the second thing is we have actually seen, I wouldn't call it an
inventory liquidation cycle, but a lot of the inventory overhang that had been persisting for
quarter after quarter after quarter has been chipped away. And typically inventory cycles
and inflation not surprisingly move together. So when you're building stockpiles, it puts upward
pressure on inflation. And when you're reducing stockpiles, obviously it does the reverse.
And we've come down sharply. I mean, inventories are now posting no growth basically. We went from
a huge increase after COVID when they couldn't initially get any inventory and then they overshot
and over ordered the double and triple order just so they'd have stuff and then spent quarters maybe
even over a year trying to unwind all of that. Well, they've largely unwound that. So inventories
are in a pretty good position. I wouldn't say they're conspicuously lean, but they're in a
decent position where they don't necessarily have to worry about reducing them significantly
farther now. I think we're pretty even. So my point is that the disinflationary pressure from
drawing down that inventory has already been built into the numbers. So that drop from 9%
in the CPI to three was in large part a function of that or alongside of it. And therefore,
the impetus for further price deflation coming from the inventory thing is probably very limited.
Unless we see a sharp contraction in consumer spending, which for the reasons we just talked
about may not happen if people can continue to just run up their credit cards and not pay them
back to sustain whatever consumption they want. So related to that, one of the things that has
surprised me and I'm guessing has surprised you in terms of just how things have been able to persist
is the labor market held in far better through this Fed tightening cycle than most people
expected. And to me, that is the, if not the key, one of the most key dominoes to be watching,
because if that can remain standing, then yeah, as long as consumer spending is going on, we're
two-thirds consumer spending economy, we'll probably muddle through okay. But if that falls,
then it's game on for all the parade of horribles that we've been talking about forever.
And looking at the market, it's the jobs market. I can definitely name some stats that are
softening. The quits rates are down. Some of the payroll numbers, they're not bad, but they're not
great. But continuing claims are coming down again. So that's positive. It just doesn't seem
like the job market is flashing super warning signals at this point in time. So while from a
lag effect standpoint and all sorts of reasons, we could think it should have probably fallen by now,
or we could think that there's risks written to fall, it still looks a lot more robust than
a lot would expect. So I'm just curious, what are your thoughts right now on employment?
Well, I think this is another manifestation of that expectations creating the reality
that I talked about at the beginning. At the same time, expectations on the part of
lenders that their borrowers would be able to pay them back as rates came down,
enabled them to continue to shovel money at them basically and sustain these feeble enterprises.
Corporations acted the same way. So they basically operated on the assumption that
you're going to see the Fed pivot and the economy is going to avert a hard landing. Therefore,
why would I lay off all these people who I struggled so desperately to hire after COVID
when I know that this is just a short-term bump in the road, and then once the Fed cuts rates,
we'll be back off to the races. So I'd rather suffer through this period holding more employment
inventory, let's say, than I normally would like to have, just because I know that there's a light
at the end of the tunnel. So if that assumption gets challenged, I think you could see a very
dramatic and immediate reduction in employment. And that's what I've been waiting for for a while,
was that this realization that, hey, that I thought I actually believed the Fed when they
said hire for longer. And so I thought, you know, Wall Street spent all year going like this. Now,
we're not listening to you. And they kept saying it and saying it and saying it. And then lo and
behold, Powell caved. I don't know why I should be shocked, because it's not the first time he's done
that, where he said, no, hire for longer. And then the next day decided he's going to pivot.
So phooey on me for actually believing what he said. But if they do actually do that,
it will shape the employment picture dramatically, because they're sitting there with surplus labor
inventory that they would shed, I would think, rapidly if there was a perception that the
landscape was not going to be pivot immediately. All right. So two things. One, just to level set,
do you agree with me that that would be a game on moment in terms of all the threats to the economy,
all of a sudden maybe get a chance to start coming in through the door?
You mean if employment were to turn the employment market?
Yes. If that, you know, bet that the faith that the corporate fleet has right now that,
look, we're going to hold on to our human capital right now, because this is going to
be a transitory period. And then we'll be back in salad days, and we'll have the right people.
If they start saying, oh, wait, that's not going to happen, and they start shedding
jobs, does that finally open the door to all those issues that we've been worried about?
It's hard to imagine it wouldn't. You would definitely think so. The other thing
alongside it, though, would be corporate profits. You know, whether one can lead the other. So
normally corporate profits, if they start to decline, will lead to the headcount.
And we didn't see that last year. We actually had the profits recession
without the labor recession. So maybe that will come down the road when they realize,
hey, we actually are going to go to a double-dip profit recession. We're going to let go of these
workers. But the other way around is you could have profit growth and this labor shedding that
ultimately creates the profits recession, because suddenly your consumers are out of work, and
therefore they're not buying stuff. Right. And if it leads that way, we might see profit growth
initially. Oh, we've reduced our headcount, so therefore profits are higher, but then the drop
in consumer spending catches up. So the reason where I'm going with all this is, OK, so let's
say the Fed actually delivers on what it is guiding the markets. We're going to do three rate cuts in
2024. You're bringing the federal funds rate or the discount rate down from, what, five and a
quarter to four and a half. That's still pretty elevated. So my point is, can the Fed's rate cuts,
can they ride to the rescue in time to rescue the corporate America fleet from all the maturity
while rerating? Can it ride to the housing markets rescue in time? Yeah, OK, maybe mortgage rates
come down into the mid to higher fives, right? This is still really expensive mortgage as to
what people were used to just two years prior, right? So are we throwing a party on somewhat
false assumptions here? Yeah. This is why I said, I think at the very top, that it depends on
whether the Fed goes soon enough and aggressively enough, because as you outlined, if you were a
junk-rated borrower borrowing at four and your rates went to eight and now they're going to go
to six, you're still screwed. It's still a massive increase in your debt service. And as I mentioned
earlier, consumer debt relative to income is back to where it was in the global financial crisis. I
mean, I remember just months ago, people pointing to that at low levels saying, look, this increase
in interest rates isn't an issue for the consumer because their debt service is still so low
relative to income. And it's like, give it a minute. Where do you think all these rate hikes
are going to be manifest? In the blink of an eye, it went parabolic, just like the rate the Fed
funds rate did. So I think that the Fed definitely has to move with alacrity and aggressively if it's
going to stave off the corporate default cycle, which is already underway. But then again,
you get into this kind of issue of the expectations feeding the reality because,
all right, let's say they don't cut in March, but if the markets believe, well, that just means
they're definitely going to cut in April, it can sustain itself. I mean, the question is how long
can the market hope, sustain that whole construct without actual rate hikes being delivered? And I
don't know how long that can go. I would say, frankly, it's surprised me that it's been able
to hold up this long. And in the face of, as I mentioned, the highest bankruptcies since
the great recession other than COVID. And again, credit card delinquencies, subprime auto loan
delinquencies, I think are at the all-time record high. So there's a lot of bad news out there that
the markets have completely ignored on the assumption that this pivot is coming and they've
ignored it for the better part of 12 months. And it was a good year generally, not just for stocks,
but for credit. So I guess I have no idea how long they can sustain this on hope, but I would say
every day that the Fed doesn't deliver, and if it doesn't deliver aggressively, it could be
catastrophic for the markets just because their expectations are so far afield of the fundamentals.
I mean, just getting back to what's actually going on in the economy, when you look at the data,
I know you mentioned Wolf-Richter felt like it's hard to forecast a recession. When I look at the
data, it's hard to believe that we're not already in a recession. When you look at things like the
leading indicator down what, 19 months? It depends on what you look at. Yeah,
exactly. There's still a lot of leading indicators, the inverted yield curves,
I mean, just all sorts of tried and true recession indicators. Right. GDI versus GDP, we've never seen
again. There's so many unprecedented data points. GDI, we've never seen it go negative when GDP was
positive before, except when you were in recession. But even during recessions, it's never been this
dramatically diverged ever in history. So I mean, there are just so many indicators out there. Then
you look at, as I mentioned, real retail sales have gone nowhere for over a year.
That's never been the case unless you've been mired in not just a medium recession,
a deep meaningful recession like '90 or 2008. So there are a lot of indicators out there that
suggest we should be deep in a recession right now. And if the markets are that far afield from
the reality, if the Fed doesn't deliver and deliver soon, we could get a reckoning of
epic proportion. The other moving part in all this, though, that leaves me even more
gunged by is it's an election year. And you just can't be too cynical about the amount of
effort that will be brought to bear to make sure that what we're talking about does not happen.
I have spoken to two people who are politically connected who were telling me over a month ago
that the Biden administration rhetoric, notwithstanding, was pushing hard for
energy producers to get out there and just pump as much pump, drill, get as much production as you
can. To lower the price of oil? Yeah. And you see it in the numbers. You see the production,
domestic production, I think is an all-time record. So yeah, they want oil prices lower.
And then who knows what happens on the fiscal front and then with the Fed suddenly doing a
pivot. So it's a really uncertain year. And that's why I guess I feel there's very little one can say
with great certainty and confidence. And the one thing that I think I can say with confidence is
that the dollar is going to pay the price for whatever policy sins we commit this year.
That's going to be the relief valve. That's the thing that's going to be sacrificed in order of
continued stability. All right. We're beginning to wrap up here, Stephanie. And again,
I could go on forever. And I know I'm going to get a ton of comments saying,
"Adam, why didn't you keep going?" No. I think they're going to be like, "Why didn't you stop
half an hour ago?" Not at all. I can guarantee you that's not going to happen. Are there any
indicators that you follow closely that we haven't talked about yet that you think are going to be
important ones to watch this year? Oh, wow. That's a good question. Yeah. Well, I'm going to be
watching that Baltic Freight Index for the shipping. What's happening? What's going on
in the red city? Yeah, in shipping rates in general, because I think that's going to be
important and obviously drives a lot of the input inflation side. And I'll be looking at things like
the Indeed weekly job postings to see what's going on on that front. I mean, we've definitely seen
a slowdown in hiring in general and the payroll numbers and the Indeed measure is definitely
rolled over, but I'd look to see if that starts to accelerate to the downside or not. And obviously,
I'm going to be watching the consumer spending and really parsing out what of that is units versus
price. And if we're seeing any kind of shifts there and continue to keep an eye on the global
movements in and out of the dollar, those will be my main focus this year. And on the credit front,
obviously, I've been watching all the corporate downgrades. We had the largest number of downgrades
last year since the global financial crisis other than COVID. So, like I said, all the credit
metrics are there flashing red, but when you look at the Bloomberg screen, they're all flashing
green. Well, and one key one that is not flashing red that I know you watch very closely are credit
spreads. That's what I mean. The actual credit quality is flashing red, but the market measures
of risk appetite are all flashing green. So credit spreads, yeah. All right. Well, Stephanie,
if on any of those key indicators throughout the year, you start seeing them move in ways
that really catch your attention and influence your outlook of where things are headed, you just
have an open invitation to come on this channel anytime and let folks know. I'm going to try to
squeeze one or two more questions in before I wrap things up if that's okay with you, just because
they're so interesting and I really want to hear your thoughts on them. And of course, one is your
market outlook. We haven't even gotten to the big question yet, which is just what do you think the
markets are going to do this coming year? I know you think they're going to be pretty good for gold,
but I'm curious, any other assets, but before we get there,
all right. So we talked about this sort of culture of moral hazard, right? There's a number
of things I'd like to talk with you about in more depth that we're not going to be able to do here,
but let me just sort of mention them briefly. One is that I sort of call this the transition
from meritocracy to aristocracy, where I think we're getting to the point where it's legitimate
to ask the question, is the American dream really only available these days to those who were
born rich, right? Where there's this huge wealth divide, we are hollowing out basically the job
system through cost cutting measures like offshoring, but also automation and now AI,
right? And it's getting increasingly, we're moving those entry-level jobs, right? We've given
companies all sorts of incentives for a very long time as we've made it more and more expensive to
employ human capital, but we've made it easier for them to replace that human capital, especially on
the lower skill level, right? So the on-ramp for younger generations to build skills and
create marketable skills, those rungs of the ladder are getting removed, right?
So for this whole host of reasons, I think we're at risk of kind of building a bifurcated society
here where you have a very few doing very well and everybody else who's seeing their prospects
as diminished and probably increasingly entering jobs that are in service of that top elite,
right? This is the discussion that you and I could have for a long time, so it's unfair for
me to ask you to opine too much on that in just a couple of minutes, but the question I wanted to
kind of get to through those questions and a few others I won't mention here, which is,
Stephanie, if I made you Empress of America, what reforms would you want to prioritize first?
Oh my gosh. Wow. That is a question. I know.
Yeah. Well, I think one thing that I would try to do immediately is just sweeping deregulation,
because I think one of the things that stands in the way of a lot of economic entrepreneurship and
vitality and feeding that capitalist spirit is just the tremendous amount of bureaucracy
that's imposed on people trying to get started in business. And the other side would be taxes
along with it. I mean, I think to have lower corporate taxes and less regulation would help
revitalize a little bit of that entrepreneurial spirit and give people greater opportunity there.
And I don't know if there's a way that you could also incentivize trade schools,
because one thing we're learning right now from, for example, look at how tarnished Harvard has
become. And as you say, a lot of these jobs, people pay tons of money to go and get a degree
at one of these schools, and then they're saddled with student debt and they don't really have much
job opportunity, because a lot of these jobs, as you said, are either already occupied or they're
going to be outsourced by AI or abroad or whatnot, maybe somehow come up with some incentive or
promotions for going to trade schools and bringing that back. I know that that's generally frowned
upon as being lesser than, but I don't think so. I think that that would help restore a sense of
pride in workmanship, et cetera. A sense of value creation in the economy versus a lot of the paper
degrees that a lot of these, quote unquote, "respectable colleges" pump out. One of the
reasons why they're graduates. You talk about paper degrees, we've created a culture where our
entire economy is basically there to create paper assets. A lot of it is just
Or not even paper. It's just to push digits from one side to the other.
I mean, we stopped creating things and we've now gone into the production of paper and digits,
as you say, and that's all very elegant and sophisticated. But I'm not sure,
especially in the world of AI, that that's necessarily a sustainable economic model for
us. Given the amount of debt that we've incurred in the process of doing that,
I think maybe getting back to some simpler things might not be the worst thing in the world.
Again, I don't know, but I would think that if you're building something that you can actually
point to and provides some purpose, physical purpose, that that might give you a sense of pride
in yourself and in your country and in your job and that kind of thing. I mean, it may sound a
little hokey, but I think that that actually is a powerful thing that might be worth getting back to.
I don't at all. I don't know if you're familiar with the work that Mike Rowe does.
Yeah, absolutely. I'm a huge fan of his, huge fan of the Mike Rowe Foundation.
Just for folks watching, I have reached out to his organization multiple times and then politely
declined so far, but I will keep knocking on that door. He's definitely an interview. I would love
to land on this channel to talk about this exact topic, Stephanie. All right. Look,
will you get my vote for Empress then? Hey, real quick, just to make sure folks really fully
understand, one of the reasons why you're pushing for less regulation and in lower taxes is not
because you're like, "Oh, I want companies to make all the money and overlord it over the populace."
It is, I believe you feel that we have sort of metastasized true capitalism and it's now become
this sort of cartel capitalism where it's actually pretty hard to find an industry that isn't
dominated by a cartel of a small number of companies that have then worked with DC to
write protective regulations around them, like a regulatory moat that make it very hard for
competitors to dislodge them. You're nodding or something. It's a much more articulate way of
saying what I was trying to say. No, not at all. But in addition to what it does in terms of the
structure, the corporate sector, it also has implications for the structure, geez, I can't
even speak anymore, of Washington DC. We have all of these bureaucratic agencies that exist simply
to regulate all of these industries and to sit there and ride their asses basically to make sure
that they're living up to these regulations. I mean, we could cut out an enormous amount of fat
there that's both encumbering our debt and deficit, but also encumbering our economy by strangling
potential entrepreneurs with this kind of unnecessary red tape. I mean, some of it,
obviously, you need regulation, but we've jumped the shark. I think it's pretty clear.
Well, I think a good analogy is love them or hate them. I think Elon Musk really
shook a lot of corporate America, or at least big tech to its core, when he fired basically
75% of the staff of Twitter. And here we are a year later, and the company is still a going
concern. He just really showed, he redefined what an essential employee is, and he really
shined a bright light on just the bloat and the fat that at least big tech has been guilty of
accreting over time. I think very similar analogy to government. And we could probably get rid of
75% of the regulations, the laws, and the legislators, and just get down to the core
ones that really matter. We probably wouldn't even notice it and probably run a lot better.
Yeah. Well, and to get rid of all the lobbyists and the whole structure that is so corrupt now.
And like you said, it really inures to the benefit of just a handful of major
corporations and big industries that hold all the power. We need to get back to
a real capitalistic system, which this is not. I totally agree. I'll just mention this because
it's interesting. I'll keep this really brief. But there was a great podcast that I think it was
This American Life did 10 years ago or something like that. But it was trying to understand how
lobbying works. And what their investigation revealed, it was the opposite of what you would
expect, where we expect that in the halls of power in DC, the mild-mannered, unassuming
politicians are walking around and there are these lobbyists with big bags of money that pounce on
them and try to influence their votes. It's totally the other way around. It's the lobbyists that get
hounded by the politicians who want their money. And when you really understand how much of a
Senator's Day or Representative's Day is spent dialing for dollars versus legislating, it's
ridiculous. So the whole system is definitely in need of a big enema, and that's a discussion.
I don't know if there is an enema big enough to get there.
All right. So I've thrown way too much in the mix here. But trying to end here on your market
outlook, what type of year do you expect given this kind of uncertainty and limbo status that
we've been talking about? Yeah. Well, it's a really good question. I wish I had a crystal
ball and I could tell you with certainty what I expected. So obviously, the one thing that I did
say I feel certain about is the dollar down and gold up. And I think treasuries will probably have
a good year. But outside of that, the layup is volatility. I think we could expect much more
volatility in the markets because for the reasons we talked about, it's not clear how soon the Fed
is going to be able to move given the inflation backdrop, and then how aggressively they'll be
able to move once they get started, and whether that'll be enough to support the markets. But I
think the markets have a very clear expectation about what the Fed's going to do. And they have
100% certainty. And whenever the markets perceive something as being, they're going to cut here,
and then there, and then there, there's a lot of room for disappointment. And that
disappointment will certainly be manifest in increased volatility. So I think that would be
just a no-brainer answer to that question. As to whether that means you end the year with lower
stocks and wider credit spreads, that would be my best guess. But I'm certainly humble enough
to say I really just can't forecast right now how this year is going to shape out. And again,
the fact that it's an election year throws a giant wrench into the whole analysis.
All right. Well, as I said earlier, Stephanie, you are welcome to come on the program anytime
to update us as the tape changes in ways that catch your attention. Just a note too that
volatility, I just interviewed Jim Carson, and volatility is something that he specializes in.
And like you, he sees it playing a much bigger role in 2024 than it has in the past two years,
particularly because it's been so compressed by forces that he and I discussed in that interview.
And folks, I'll tell you in a second how to listen to that interview if you
maybe want to listen to it after this one.
One last thing that kind of plays into that increased volatility that we didn't talk about
at all, and I'll just throw it out there, is the Bank of Japan and what they do this year. We're
also focused on the Fed. The Bank of Japan, if they actually do start to undertake a tightening
cycle, would be a tectonic shift in the global financial plates that would have repercussions
here. So that's just another one to keep an eye on. Oh my goodness. All right. Let's flag that
as one to get into the next time you come on here. Right. That was way too much to talk about here.
Okay. But I appreciate you putting it on the board. All right. Well, look, as we wrap up here,
I've got two questions I'm going to ask you here. The latter one, which I'm going to ask you about
in about a minute, is we've been talking all about money and financial investing through this
interview. I've been asking my experts recently if there's any sort of non-money related investment
that they would encourage people to consider adopting in their lives. So I'll ask you that
in just a second. Much more important question, though, before I do, which is for people that
have really enjoyed this conversation, Stephanie, and would like to follow you and your work from
here, where should they go? Well, they can go to macromavons.com and you can pull up some old
reports there and see some media stuff and find some information on how to subscribe.
Or you can follow me on Twitter, although I'm not a particularly religious tweeter. Can they say
or exer? What's the term now? I just stick with Twitter. I haven't moved on to the ex-brand yet.
Yeah. So I'm @spomboy there, except no substitutes. There are plenty of imposters out there. I don't
know why anyone would try to impersonate anybody, much less me, but apparently they do. So @spomboy.
All right. Well, Stephanie, when I edit this, I will put up the links to your website and
your Twitter handle right there on the screen so folks know exactly where to go. Folks,
I'll have the links in the description below the video too. Two things on Twitter. One,
just to Stephanie's point there about imposters, if you ever get contacted by somebody over social
media by Stephanie or by me, and they are trying to solicit you for anything, it's not us. It's
scammers. And there was a scourge of scammers on social media. I really am hoping all the
major social media platforms up level their anti-scammer or spammer defenses this year,
because it's just such a nightmare, as you know, Stephanie, having to explain to people,
no, it's not me trying to sell you that crypto product, right?
Yeah. Yes. It's definitely not me in that case. I'll also just make a quick comment here too,
Stephanie, because I think I told you about this once, but I'm a very goal-oriented person. And so
in trying to grow my Twitter audience, what I do is I achieve a milestone and I say, okay, great,
who's somebody who has more people than me, and then let me try to work to get more than them.
And I was kind of picking off all these different personalities on Twitter since I started my
account. Well, about middle of next last year, I started getting close to you. So you were the
rabbit that I was chasing. Oh my gosh. Well, you've certainly passed me by now. No, no. As of today,
we have finally caught up to you, but it has been a six-month painful journey. And because I got
within a couple hundred followers of you, and then our good friend Grant Williams said, "Hey,
everybody, you really got to be following Stephanie. If you haven't followed her,
you should go follow her." So overnight, you jumped by several thousand more people ahead of
me. So I was like, "Oh gosh, all right. Well, I'm going to work even harder now." And I got back up
close to you. Well, and then you started going on Tucker Carlson and you started jumping up after
every appearance. So it has been a long slog trying to reel you in, but we were finally neck
and neck here. And anyway, she's a great competitor. All I can say, Adam, is that I'd much prefer to be
racing you on Twitter than on a sidewalk because you would have blown by me 10 years ago for sure.
Until you brought us into a Pilates studio and then I would have cracked in half,
given how inflexible I am. I doubt that. But anyways, and just to make it clear for folks,
what's been the most painful part about catching Stephanie on Twitter is that I work really
hard at it. And she tweets only occasionally and only when she's got something important to say.
And the fact that I probably put about 100 times more effort into it than you and yet
took me so long to catch up to you just shows how much better at this than I you are.
No, I think it shows that I really need to put more effort into my Twitter.
Well, if you ever do, you're going to leave me in the dust.
No, I'm sure I won't.
All right. Well, a couple of quick housekeeping things before the last question. One, folks,
if you've enjoyed this conversation with Stephanie and would like to let her know you'd love to have
her come back on the program anytime she wants, please let her know by hitting the like button,
then clicking on the red subscribe button below was that little bell icon right next to it.
Just a reminder for folks, too, that I on my sub stack, which is still relatively new,
I put out updates almost every day about the goings on here at
Thoughtful Money. But I also have resumed my Adam's notes, which are my cliff notes,
detailed summaries, excuse me, of these interviews.
So if you want to start getting those, including my notes to this interview with Stephanie,
then go to my sub stack and sign up for the premium version there.
And my sub stack is just at adamteggert.substack.com.
I also want to remind folks, too, that Thoughtful Money is doing its first conference. That's going
to be this March. And Stephanie has kindly agreed, as she has appeared in my past conferences,
to be a participant this time around as well. She's always a fan favorite for reasons, folks,
that should be abundantly clear here now at the end of this discussion.
So Stephanie, just want to say thanks for being willing to appear in that.
Looking forward to it.
All right. And then here we are now finally at the last question, which is,
in addition to all the financial stuff we just talked about,
what's a non-money related investment you'd encourage folks to consider?
Well, it's not an investment into a thing. It would be an investment of time,
if I can use that as my investment. I feel like it's so important to invest in time
with people that you get great soul satisfaction from peeing with. Just taking time to be with
friends. I have a friend that we walk our dogs together in the afternoons, and that hour just
strolling around with their dogs is just something I so look forward to. And that kind of thing just
brings joy. And if you do that on a regular basis and you make time for those kind of things,
it really it's what matters in life. I feel like all the rest of this stuff is intellectually
stimulating and hopefully financially rewarding if you can get it right. But nothing fills your soul
and is as healthy, I think, as spending time with people you really love and making sure
that you commit the time to do that. All right. Very well said. I've talked
a fair amount in this program about the supremacy of relationships really when it comes to wealth,
because that's, I've said probably now ad nauseum, when they interview people who live to be 100,
that's the number one thing they always say is the quality of their relationships. It's because
we're social creatures. We're tribal social animals. So I won't pile on to the comments
I've made in the past on this. I do want to pile on to one part of what you said, Stephanie,
which is you go for a walk with your dogs. Time with the people you care about is super
important. Time with dogs is really important. And I don't know if you read the book Sapiens
that came out a couple of years ago, Stephanie. It's a New York Times bestseller. It basically
is a chronicling of the human species from literally when Homo sapiens evolved from the other
proto forms of man and follows them through prehistoric times, then the agricultural age,
and then the technology age. But one of the things I took away from the book was
the first animal to be domesticated by humans was dogs, which kind of surprised me because I
figured it would have been something that we could have eaten, right? Like a chicken or whatever,
but it was dogs. And it was because dogs were attracted to our garbage piles and they were
scavenging from there and we ended up creating a relationship with them. But the other thing
that's really interesting is the gap between when we domesticated the dog, between when we
domesticated the next animal. And I am doing this from memory, so it's probably not exact,
but I think it was like maybe 20,000 years ago we domesticated the dog. It wasn't until like,
it was like another 10,000 or more years before we domesticated the second animal. And then we
started domesticating a bunch, right? But the point is, is dogs have been in the human experience
longer than any other animal to the point where I think we have kind of co-evolved together.
And so just the emotional fulfillment you get from that human dog relationship, I do think is
different than any other animal. And I'm not slamming on you if you like your cat or your
goldfish or your parrot or whatever, but there really is something special about dogs and humans.
I think that's so true. I guess it's an ancestral kinship it sounds like, but you don't have to
persuade me. I could have gone on for hours about the importance of spending time with your dog,
but people already know I'm obsessed with my dog. So I don't...
Well, Wilhelmina is a celebrity in herself.
Oh my gosh. The one thing I would say though, in addition to it being important to invest the time
with people that you enjoy spending time with and you love and spending the time with your dogs,
it's equally important to disinvest from people who don't fill your soul,
who don't bring positivity into your life. I think that's just as important
as finding people who do, because if you surround yourself with people who are negative and bring
you down, it's impossible to avoid being impacted by that. So I don't know, maybe that's something
that comes with getting older where you feel like it's okay to have less friends who are really good
friends and not to have 30 people, 20 of whom you don't really enjoy spending time with.
Superficial or exactly, yeah, they're not adding to you. So my wife is a therapist, as you know,
Stephanie, and there is a theory, I can't remember exactly what it's called, but essentially it's
sort of like you are the average of the five people that you spend most time with. So it's
all about trying to really be selective and picking the people whom you spend the majority
of your time with to make sure that they are always pulling you up to the group average.
I'm blessed in that regard. So I'm a happy girl.
It sounds like you're choosing well. And of course, you're somebody who I think a lot of
people would love to have in their five circles because I think you're somebody that pulls people
up. I don't know. But anyway, well, thank you so much, Adam. It's a pleasure to get to spend this
time with you always. And I hope I made some sense, although I'm incredibly, as you can tell,
confused and befuddled about where we're going this year. So I'm just trying my best to put the
pieces together. Well, Steph, it's always a pleasure. And I appreciate you being so
transparent because I think a lot of people are seeing themselves in you here by saying,
look, I'm confused by a lot of things that are going on here. A lot of stuff's happening that
I didn't expect or I see the data going one way, but reality going another. So I appreciate your
generosity and courage to say, hey, there are some things here that I'm scratching my head about.
All right, Steph, it's always I don't think I'm going to insult anybody by saying this,
that you're always my favorite person to interview here. Thank you for giving us so much time.
No, looking forward to lots of great discussions with you in 2024. Stephanie, thanks so much.
Thank you, Adam.
All right. Well, now is the time when the program will be bringing the lead partners
from New Harbor Financial, one of the financial advisory firms endorsed by Thoughtful Money.
I'm joined as usual by lead partners John Lodra and Mike Preston. Mike was off last week. So Mike,
now that you're back, why don't we start with you? Anything you want to respond to from this
pretty, as usual, phenomenal discussion with Stephanie?
I love the discussion with Stephanie, Adam. Thanks so much. And essentially,
you know, she was humbled. She started off by saying that she was humbled. I mean,
my goodness, the S&P 500 was up 24% roughly in 2023. Who would have expected that? She talked
about bank failures, you know, that happened early in the year. We saw a continuation of
the bond market collapse and rising yields. The 10-year yield touched 5%. And so, you know,
a lot of things were going on. And the fundamentals continue to be very negative.
And we have valuations that continue to remain in the stratosphere. It's like this permanently high
plateau that just won't ever be allowed to correct. And I know there's some disagreement
about what fundamentals to use, but we've looked at a whole bunch of different ones.
And we think we're looking at the right ones. We think we're looking at valuation fundamentals that
are highly correlated to what's likely to happen over the long term. The surprising thing is that
the Fed and other central banks have created this money printing magic that's just lasted so long,
15 years, 15 long years of not knowing exactly what's what and what's real anymore because we're
so disconnected from fundamentals. But Stephanie said that she's been humbled. Well, I can tell you,
we've been humbled too. And we don't look at just calendar years. We've been humbled the last several
years at just how long this has gone on. You know, but she talks about expectations have been really
high. Expectations have been really high for Fed pivot, soft landing, that type of thing. And when
Chairman Powell a couple months ago talked about potentially easing and maybe three rate cuts in
2024, the market took off and it's been in a pretty straight line. And perhaps we'll share
some charts later that show why we became concerned about another trip to the highs a
couple months ago. And we took some actions to prepare for that. Now we suggest short
of all time highs on the S&P. It's likely that we make new highs even with these bad fundamentals.
We don't know. We'll talk a little more about the details there a little bit later. But
when you asked Stephanie, how do you react to all of this? She basically said cash on the sidelines
is how I react to this. That's pretty much what we think as well, although we're not 100% in cash.
Obviously we're over 40% in treasury bills still. And some of the pieces that we have in our puzzle
or in our model have been working quite well, which gave us positive performance last year.
Gold is testing its all time high. Gold mining stocks are lagging, but we think that's going
to change. And some of the specific sectors that we have picked have been working out.
So Stephanie says she believes this year we'll see the dollar go higher over the year and gold
go higher. I think- Just to correct, she thinks the dollar is going to go lower over the year.
Thank you for correcting me, Adam. I was just going to say that we disagree on the dollar,
and I had that reversed. She thinks the dollar will go lower on the year and gold higher. We
actually think the dollar will go higher and gold will go higher. I would say that ours is more a
short term call. I think that we agree with Stephanie over the long term, the dollar will
likely be lower, but we think that's probably maybe even two years out, one to two years out.
In the near term, particularly if we see the kind of economic crisis or collapse in the stock market
that we expect could happen even this year, the dollar is likely to go higher in the very short
term. And thus we have a long position in the dollar. And of course we're big bulls and gold.
So towards the end of the conversation, she talked a little bit about the BRICS summit. I learned from
her that the BRICS summit this summer is in Russia. Last year it was in South Africa. Maybe the fact
that it's in Russia will mean that bigger news will be released about a potential competitor
to the dollar. I don't know. I view a potential BRICS currency as a long-term negative for the
US dollar, not necessarily a short one. As she pointed out, Russia and China are already trading
with each other in alternate currencies outside of the United States dollar. So lastly, she said
that there's going to be a lot of volatility. If she's sure about one thing, there's going to be
a lot of volatility that we're in no man's land here and that she called it a cop out that she's
sitting in cash. I don't think it's a cop out at all. I think it's a sign of humility that cash is
paying 5%, at least for now. And valuations are stretched beyond all imagination. And whether we
go higher into another bubble and collapse or collapse from here, we know from fundamentals,
this market will be a lot lower at some point. So I'm really impressed with her
directness and humility in that and overall a very enjoyable conversation.
All right. A very enjoyable conversation. It's just an understatement when you talk to Stephanie
because it's just such a pleasure. John, why don't we let you chime in on anything you want
to add to what Mike said there. And Mike talked about how your strategies resulted in a positive
return for you guys last year. If you could, talk a little bit about how New Harbor performed in 2023.
Yeah. Great to be with you again, Adam. And hello everybody in this new year. Thank you for tuning
in. As I said last week with my chat with you, Adam, we too were humbled. And we were probably
very much in the camp like many folks were a year ago calling for a pretty high likelihood
of a recession. Interestingly, look now that same survey has almost nobody clung for a recession. So
if you want to talk about contrarian data points, we're not going to go out on a limb here and say
recession yes or no. In fact, we don't even think that's the right question to ask, but that very
data might be an interesting contrarian signal. But yeah, we did have a successfully positive
last year. We're not the kind of folks that take victory laps, certainly not on a single year
because our clients don't retire for one year. They retire for 20, 30, 40 years, hopefully. And
I think as much as last year being amazingly strong market on the headlines, I think it's
really important to remind what last year was in follow up to a very poor 2022. And maybe by way of
sharing that, I'll just share a chart of the S&P 500 to kind of pull that into context. If you
couldn't enable screen sharing, Adam. But in many ways, last year was basically digging out of losses
of 2022. And in fact, maybe no better poster child than Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF. That was up
about 60 some odd percent last year, but it was down about 60% the year before 2022. Now most
folks would be tempted to say a negative 60% followed by a positive 60%. Wow, we're back to
even, but that's not how compounding returns work. In fact, even after that 60 ish percent return
last year, the ARK fund is still down about 40% give or take over that two-year period. That's how
unkind have suffering large drawdowns is. So let me share a screen of the S&P 500 just to kind of
put things in context. So this is a daily chart going back a few years of the S&P. Here's the
prior high January 3rd of 2022. The closing high was 4,796. We were three points away from that
last week during the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's. We've since turned
down pretty sharply here in the short term. So you basically see the market went on a long,
very interesting and scary trip to nowhere over the last couple of years. Last year,
just focusing on 2023, and I'm going to speak in generalities. This is not a statement about every
one of our clients, but on average, our typical client who is in our flagship portfolio had
positive returns of about between five and 6% net of our fees. If not for our fees, they would have
been up a little higher, of course. And this is important as we're happy that they had some
positive returns. The volatility was far less in our approach by design, the way we hedge and the
way we're keeping lots of dry powder. I estimate, for example, even a 60/40 portfolio, typical
portfolio that most folks might get from a traditional firm in the July through October
drawdown last year was probably about a 9% drawdown. Our clients saw maybe a 3 to 3.5,
maybe 4% drawdown at the same time. So over the last couple of years, our clients are up about
3%, 3.5% net of fees, whereas even a 60/40 portfolio was down about 1% or so over the
last couple of years. So we're not going to take any victory laps, certainly not in any single year,
but we're happy that despite a very challenging and perplexing couple of years, our approach so
far has done quite well. But we're looking forward. It doesn't matter the past. It's
all about forward from here. While I'm on this chart of the S&P, I did want to point out, we did
just recently, we're about 40% give or take in equities right now, much of which we have hedged,
and about 15% or nearly half of that we have hedged in put options on the S&P. We took the
opportunity with the recent strength to move those put options up so that they have a strike price of
$5,500 on the S&P. So that's about a 4% below current levels. So the way to think about that
is those hedges have about a 4% insurance deductible, if you will, before they kick in.
But beyond that, if we do get some follow through to the downside, we're very comfortable that the
hedges we have will stem some of that downside. Make no mistake about it, a lot of our short-term
indicators are favorable. I hesitate to call them bullish because bullish portrays, hey,
there's nothing but higher prices ahead. They're favorable. But there's also some things that are
unfavorable, very stretched, very overbought in the near term, things like the percent of stocks
in the S&P above their 50-day moving average. It's like over 90%. Rarely does it get there.
And when it does, it's a mixed bag in terms of follow through returns. But we're positioned
the way we think we should be given the stew of things on the table.
John, let me just say one thing quickly, Adam. I think you misspoke by accident. You said the
strike price was $5,500. It's $4,500 just for the viewers. It's easy to do. But the line is correct
at $4,500. We are hedged out to March up to $4,500 with our current puts. All right. Thanks for
mentioning that, Mike. It was actually here in my notes, so you do that. And I'll also add,
our bullish position on the dollar, it's through long call options. So effectively, what that is,
is it's being long the dollar, but it has a put option basically built in to that trade,
so that if the dollar does weaken significantly, we're basically hedged on the downside.
Yeah. And so I appreciate you walking through that, John, to underscore a couple of things.
One is your guys' approach there at New Harbor. One of the adjectives I use most often when I
describe your firm and your services is risk management. You guys are really always first
and foremost saying, OK, how do we start from a position where we're really minimizing the
potential for loss? And then when we feel good about that, how do we get some prudent gain on
top of that? So for people, especially people who are later in life, like you said, John,
people don't retire for a year. Hopefully, they retire for decades. You're being as
conscientiously conservative with preserving their capital as you can be.
And Stephanie, as she looked into the coming year, she said, look, there's a lot I don't know.
And therefore, I think volatility is going to be a big part of what happens in 2024.
So strategies like the kind that you guys employ are ones that are basically adding
defensive shielding around portfolios when it comes to volatility so that if you're
caught offsides by the trade you've made, you guys have put the type of insurance in place
that is not going to completely remove downside risk, but it's going to hopefully
heavily mitigate it in those areas where you've got that insurance protection in place. You're
nodding as I'm saying this, John. Yeah, that's spot on, Adam. That's the way we see it.
All right. So anyways, just wanted to underscore if Stephanie sounded compelling to you,
finding defensive risk management strategies that help defend against
volatility, good way to go. All right, boys, just in wrapping up here,
got to keep this section short this week simply because we went so long with Stephanie,
which is always such a good thing. Mike, maybe I'll let you wrap up here by talking about
anything else you want to, but specifically maybe you want to talk about gold for a second.
You normally give us an update on it, but obviously given Stephanie's comments on it
and the fact that we are still kind of dancing near all-time highs for the precious metal,
how are the charts looking to you right now? The charts in gold are still sitting right there.
You're trying to break convincingly that triple top. I don't know if I have to share the chart,
but it's been a long and slow winding sideways base and it's just frustratingly just below that
ceiling. Spot gold is holding above 2000. It really has to break through 2100 or so
and stay there for a couple of days. I think that will spark the move higher and I think it would
hit 2500 pretty quickly based on the charts. That's what the measured move higher would be
based on the consolidation that we've seen in the charts.
Stephanie says that she could see gold 3000 by the end of the year. There's no telling what the high
would be once you get a big base breakout like that, but the fundamentals are certainly there
and the technicals are there. What we're still seeing frustratingly with gold near its all-time
highs is a continued underperformance in gold lining stocks. There's long periods of time
historically where gold mining stocks underperform and/or outperform the spot gold price. We happen
to be living through a period here for the last almost 10 years now of underperformance.
And whether or not there's good reasons for that underperformance, and I'm sure that I could
list some of those reasons or speculate on some of those reasons, it doesn't really matter. The
cycles kind of come and go like sine waves, outperformance, underperformance, back and forth,
back and forth. And if gold catches a bid and institutions start piling in, gold stocks will
come up too, and then they'll move from underperformance to at par performance,
and then hopefully eventually to outperformance. So we'll see what happens there, but gold moving
to 2500 or so should be a big boost to gold mining stocks if that indeed happens. That's what it
looks like for us. Silver has even more potential. So the last thing I would say in wrapping up,
just reflecting on some conversations I've had recently, is we don't know exactly what's going
to happen yet. No money manager does. We have very strong beliefs about the fundamentals
and about history and about cycles. We feel very strongly that we're in a fourth turning,
that the next few years are going to surprise all of us in what we might see in this world. And that
what we see in the world, the real world is certainly going to be felt in the financial
markets too. And I think one of the big reasons that people hire a firm like ours is because
we have a viewpoint that is at least somewhat in alignment with theirs. And the people that hire us
say, "We want you to take care of this. We want to delegate this to you." And not just for today,
so we're trying to make money today, believe me, but what we're really trying to do as well
is not lose. We have to allow for a little bit of wiggle room on the downside, but we want to not
lose on the way down when we know that this will eventually happen. We'd like to make money on the
downside if we can. It's very difficult in recent years, but we'd like to if we can.
But at a minimum, we don't want to lose on the downside. And we'd like to layer into the market
and get people's money deployed at a level where they can actually enjoy an 8% to 10% to 12% return
for the rest of their lives. There's almost no asset that I can think of that offers those types
of returns. Maybe gold does over the balance of the next decade or two, but certainly stocks don't.
Stocks are priced to achieve negative returns in the next 10 years.
And just to be super clear, you're saying stocks don't at today's current valuation.
At today's price. At today's price. And there's some charts that I've read,
Hussman put out a piece the other day updating a lot of his charts. They're great. I'll save time
by not bringing them up on the screen. But John Hussman's charts show minus 4% over the next 10
or 12 years is what we can expect. The GMO in Boston puts out some similar stuff. A lot of
other people have models that are respectable, that we respect. Valuations are out of this world.
We're living through a very different time these last 10 or 15 years. So a passive model or passive
basket of stocks today will achieve negative returns. And so with T-bills yielding 5% or more,
it's no surprise that Steph said she's waiting in cash, waiting for better prices. But that weight
has literally driven people mad for over 10 years now. So that's why people hire us, to basically
delegate all that worry and to know that they can trust that we're not going to fall prey to that
emotional hole that's so hard. That's so hard. And so we don't know what the path is going to be,
where we're going to do our best and we're going to make little mistakes along the way.
But overall, we hope to get it right and to protect the downside and to place our clients
money where that they can actually get a return over the rest of their lives.
All right. Well, thanks, Mike. I want to thank both of you guys. I mean,
one for coming on the channel regularly, like you always do. But again, just to remind folks,
one of the main reasons why I do that is to have you guys model for viewers of what a good
professional financial advisor, how they think, the steps they take in response to changing
developments in a week-to-week basis, the rationales they come up for, why they're placing
the trades they do or coming up with the portfolio strategies they do. So thanks for being so
transparent in all this, folks. And again, my general advice to viewers here is the vast
majority of people don't have the bandwidth, the time, the desire, the experience to manage their
money in this highly uncertain, highly unvolatile environment, which we find ourselves as well as a
good financial advisor who understands all the issues that we've talked about here and that I
talked about with Stephanie. And so if people want to go find their way and talk to folks like you,
great. But whomever they talk to, at least they have your guys' example as an example of how a
good professional does it. And then they can use that to determine how they make the decisions in
terms of who they ultimately work with. So thank you guys for, again, continuously making yourselves
available to serve as that model. All right, guys, we'll look as we wrap up here, just a couple of
quick things. Folks, if you enjoyed this conversation with Stephanie, would like to see her
come back on the channel again, please encourage her to do so by hitting the like button, then
clicking on the red subscribe button below. So what was that little bell icon right next to it?
A reminder that I am back publishing my Adam's Notes, which are my cliff note,
deep dive summaries into all the interviews that I do. I'm publishing those on my substack over
at AdamTaggart.substack.com. I put a lot of free content out there almost daily during the week
about everything that's going on at Thoughtful Money. But if you want to get my
Adam's Notes, including my Adam's Notes for this discussion with Stephanie, then subscribe to the
premium service there and you'll get them that way. Let's see here in wrapping up, John, Mike,
I guess, guys, just want to say thanks so much. I'm really looking forward to the time where I
can be flashing on the screen where folks can go to sign up to get matched with a financial advisor
like I used to do in the past. We are hopefully just a couple of weeks away from that. As you
guys know, I've been cramming with every spare second I have when I'm not making videos or laid
low by COVID or going to family shooter roles and all the crazy things that have been going on
recently because I'm studying for that securities exam, which hopefully I will pass and that will be
the key thing that unlocks the final piece of the puzzle here for the full Thoughtful Money offering.
So hopefully, guys, maybe in two weeks when you're on here, I'll have good news to share with
everybody. But in the interim, guys, thanks so much for coming on the channel. Everybody else,
thanks so much for watching. We'll see you next week.
Thank you, Adam. Really appreciate being here with you and we'll see you next week.
Thank you, Adam, and Happy New Year to you and everyone else, all you viewers. See you soon.
