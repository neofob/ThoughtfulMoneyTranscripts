 bullish sentiment is getting very
 overbought, our risk reward ranges that
 we publish in our newsletter every
 weekend are extremely extended. You're
 going to get a correction here. Now what
 causes it, there's a lot of catalysts.
 Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its
 founder and your host, Adam Taggart,
 welcoming you back here at the end of
 another week, special week this week. It
 was Thanksgiving and we obviously have
 a lot going on. I am joined as usual by
 my tryptophan-saturated friend, Lance
 Roberts. How you doing, Lance?
 I'm doing good and yes, that was quite
 the fest yesterday. So yeah, back on the
 diet wagon today.
 Yeah, if either one of us falls
 asleep in the middle of this
 conversation, slips into a food
 coma, folks don't take it personally.
 Exactly.
 All right, well look, so it's been a bit
 of an abbreviated week in the markets
 obviously because of the holiday but
 they are up for the week. This
 rally that we've been seeing continues
 here. I believe after talking to you last
 week that you are still expecting some
 sort of near-term cooling off here
 before things resume again into the end
 of the year. Is that still what you're
 expecting?
 Yeah, absolutely. I mean we've
 had a very big rally here. Markets are
 overbought short-term
 and I'm actually writing an article on
 this exact topic for Tuesday. So it'll be
 our Tuesday piece that's coming out of
 the website.
 But yeah, going through the
 historical facts and even if you look at
 just seasonal data, right, you see all
 these charts about seasonality
 and it says okay, well you know every
 year you have this is the seasonal trend
 from October to December, this is what
 markets do. Well if you actually look at
 that chart, you'll see a little dip
 right at the beginning of December and
 the reason for that
 is that that's when mutual funds have to
 distribute all their capital gains,
 dividends and interest for the year. So
 you get a bit of selling that comes into
 the market, particularly when markets are
 overbought already
 going into that period. You typically get
 a bit of correction, then you get a
 rally, the Santa Claus rally
 into the end of the year as all those
 mutual funds have to basically rebalance
 their portfolios for the year-end window
 dressing. So
 you know it's not anything surprising
 here that you're going to get a bit of a
 correction and that'll be a good
 opportunity to add some more exposure to
 your portfolio
 when that happens.
 So look, as an investor
 one of the things we talked
 about last week is that you for
 much of Q4 have been telling people you
 thought the risk was more to the upside
 than the downside.
 There was a period there in October
 we're getting a lot of parade of bad
 data
 and you were getting a lot of pushback
 saying Lance you just don't get it,
 you're ignoring all this data that's
 going to drag the market down. Obviously
 market didn't get dragged down, it
 started powering higher again.
 And now those same people are going, you're
 talking about a correction that's never
 going to happen, this is
 onward and upward from here.
 Well I mean is it that way or are there
 people who are still
 expecting the wheels to come
 off coming into the end of the year
 and you're basically saying no folks
 expect this more usual Santa Claus
 rally?
 No, my Twitter feed is
 I've been talking about this
 potential correction now for about a
 week and a half, two weeks on Twitter
 saying hey this is great, use
 this rally as an opportunity, rebalance
 risk, take some profits, do your tax law
 selling.
 This is a great time to do it,
 use this rally for that because we'll
 get a bit of a correction here.
 So now all the Twitter commentary is
 like you don't understand momentum in
 the markets, this is just going to carry
 on, we're not here.
 So yeah but this is always the case
 right, October lows everybody's super
 bearish,
 everybody's selling at that point. This
 is why investors historically always buy
 low and sell,
 sorry sell low and buy high because
 they do exactly the opposite of what
 they should do when markets are
 trending. Bullish sentiments getting
 very overbought, technicals
 are extremely overbought, our risk
 reward ranges that we publish in our
 newsletter every weekend are extremely
 extended,
 you're going to get a correction here.
 Now what causes it? There's a lot of
 catalysts, I mean the Fed's going to come
 out and at their next FOMC meeting and
 say
 yeah we're higher for longer, we're still
 worried about inflation
 because the market rally is now
 is loosening financial conditions which
 is exactly not what the Fed wants so the
 markets
 keep doing, keep working
 against themselves
 with respect to the Fed. So that
 could, the Fed statement's going to be
 more hawkish than expected I would
 imagine
 and that's probably going to drag
 markets down a bit. That may cool things
 up, okay so
 so basically everybody's back on the
 party bus now that
 they've realized stocks were going
 higher. Okay so we're going to hopefully
 get a chance today to talk about your
 recent piece
 "Speculator or Investor, What's the
 Role?" I want to get to a couple of
 things,
 a couple other specific assets in just a
 moment. So before I do,
 let's just look at the technicals
 here. We're still
 way elevated above the major moving
 averages and I'm sure you're going to
 talk about
 overbought and regression to the
 mean and stuff like that.
 Let me just say, imagine that,
 but let's say the market just
 flattens from here.
 The longer it flattens, that's
 actually bullish, right? It gives those
 averages time to catch up to it?
 Yeah, absolutely. So you'll look at,
 like for instance just looking at this
 chart, so this kind of
 these shaded bars on the right are
 what's called a Fibonacci retracement
 sequence.
 Fibonacci was a
 mathematician. He discovered what's
 called this golden ratio that exists
 throughout the world. We talked about
 this before, whether it's the
 length of your elbow to your fingertip or
 the number of sunflower seeds in the
 sunflower,
 the rings on a
 conch shell, etc., all relate back to
 these mathematical sequences. Math
 basically describes everything in the
 universe and
 so what he discovered was is that these
 specific
 ratios, these specific percentages just
 occur repeatedly in nature
 and we can apply that to the financial
 markets because markets typically tend
 to run
 within the context of these Fibonacci
 sequences and so when you get a big
 rally, so from the peak to the trough
 that we had back this summer, we've since
 almost now recovered a hundred percent
 of that sell-off because we're nearing
 the July high. So if this market will
 keep rallying here for another couple of
 days,
 you know, we're going to get to the
 highs for the year.
 So, you know, we've had a terrific
 retracement
 and so now we're probably going to
 get a pullback to some of these kind
 of
 percentage retracement levels which
 happen to coincide
 with areas of of previous resistance
 that are now support.
 Whether it's a moving average, whether
 it's a a
 previous place where we topped in the
 market, etc., those are now going to
 provide support for a bit of a pullback.
 So again,
 you know, kind of looking at these
 potential pullback areas
 are going to give you some idea of where
 potentially that we can start adding
 exposure portfolios. But importantly,
 if you take a look at the top chart,
 which is basically just a basic
 moving average convergence divergence
 indicator normally known as a MACD,
 that gives you great buy and sell
 signals for when to add exposure or take
 exposure off the markets. And
 right now that that indicator is getting
 very elevated and
 we're back to to kind of the levels we
 were back in June where the market
 started the summer correction.
 Also, if you take a look at RSI at
 the bottom, the relative strength index,
 we're back to
 to basically above 70. That is a very
 overbought level for the market. So again,
 just,
 you know, you have to always remember
 markets are like rubber bands.
 And a good example of this is go
 back to June.
 In June, we were looking at this
 huge run-up that we had in March, April,
 May,
 and saying, look, we're due for a five to
 a 10% correction.
 And everybody was like, no, this market
 is just going up from here. We're already at
 15%. We're gonna be at 30% by the end of
 the year. It's gonna be fantastic.
 I was like, look, you're gonna get a
 correction because markets are
 exceedingly overbought. They're very
 stretched, deviated from long-term means.
 You're gonna get a correction of five to
 ten percent,
 completely normal with any given market
 year. And that's exactly what we had.
 The correction from peak to trough was
 10.3%.
 So you're, you know, these things just
 occur
 over and over in time. And the problem
 with investors
 is they always extrapolate what's
 currently happening
 based on what their hopes are that this
 is going to last forever. This market is
 just going to go up forever. Or
 conversely,
 when markets are going down, we now
 believe that markets just go down
 forever and
 they're never going to go up again. So I
 just need to get out of the markets. But
 this is why investors
 always repeatedly do the wrong thing for
 the portfolio at the wrong time.
 Okay. Hey, the blue arrows that are there,
 are those on the
 most recent buy signal? Is that what
 those are? Yeah, basically the blue
 arrow at the top was the MACD buy signal
 that we got
 right at the end of October and that was
 also at the same point that we broke
 above the 50-day moving average. So
 those two coincided with each other. So
 that was your real point right
 there.
 Now, again, we were buying
 in late October to get ready for
 this rally. The market started rallying,
 but
 your point that was, okay, we're back in a
 bullish buy signal was the break
 above that triggering of the MACD buy
 and
 that break above the moving average
 because now you've taken
 kind of the impediments away from
 the market to go higher
 and since then markets have just gone
 higher.
 Okay, so that's not the same buy signal on two graphs, that's two
 coincident buy signals, which I'm
 guessing gave you some confidence, right?
 Like, oh, we're seeing on multiple
 indicators now.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, and that's the way,
 look, you know, technical analysis,
 you know, if you talk to technical
 analysts, like Sven Heinrich is a
 good example,
 great technical analyst, right? He gets
 very, you know, he has a million
 different indicators that he looks at,
 right? Tom McClellan, same thing, they have
 a million different indicators they look
 at
 because their whole focus is, that's
 their world, right, is technical
 analysis. So they understand,
 you know, all these, you know, different
 variations of technical analysis and
 what it means.
 For the average person, they're going, I
 don't understand, it's just a bunch of
 lines on the graph, what does that mean?
 And this is one we talked about before,
 just as an investor,
 you know, you can be a fundamental
 investor, that's fine and dandy, no
 problem with that, you can buy
 fundamentals.
 But you've got to have at least a little
 basic knowledge of some very
 basic technical analysis to help you
 manage the risk
 versus the reward of when you're
 allocating capital or not.
 So, you know, this is a very basic, you
 know, chart, it's just two moving
 averages, the 50 and the 200 day moving
 average,
 a MACD and an RSI. And so what you're
 looking for
 is great, I get a buy signal
 and a good example of this is if we go
 back
 to basically early or
 October, we got a buy signal on the MACD
 and it's like, okay, we got the buy
 signal, let's go.
 And the market then failed at the 50-day
 moving average and then went to new lows
 by the end of the month.
 So you didn't have confirmation, you had
 one indicator telling you it was a buy,
 but you didn't have a confirmation from
 the other indicators.
 And so if you can get confirmation from,
 you know, two or three of your indicators
 to confirm
 that whatever signal you're getting has
 been confirmed by another action,
 gives you a lot higher confidence that,
 you know, you're making the right bet
 with your money. So you're going to be
 late, you know, you didn't buy the exact
 bottom,
 but when the market broke
 above 50-day, that was a good
 confirmation that this is probably going
 to be a buy signal that lasts
 and you can allocate money to the market
 and you've made some money since then.
 So that's our goal, right? Our goal
 is not to try to capture
 100% of a market move. If I can get 50%
 of it, I'm good.
 Got it, yeah. And that's similar to
 sort of the value I see this channel
 offering is I talk to all sorts of
 different experts and
 they have different approaches, different
 methodologies, and I find that when many
 experts are saying the same thing,
 it gives me more confidence in the
 probability of that thing happening
 because it's like having these multiple
 different indicators, right, that are
 just complementing one another.
 Didn't always work, but I think it takes
 some of the risk out of the system.
 So looking at this set of data here
 right now, Lance,
 it does not seem that,
 you know, even though we're at nosebleed
 levels, it does not seem that cell
 signals have been triggered yet,
 but just from your experience, you're
 saying, hey, when you're up here,
 obviously the cyclicality
 kicks in at some point
 and you're nervous enough
 about that that you're probably
 lightening up a little bit right now?
 No, no, we already did our tax loss
 selling. We did that
 during the pre-Thanksgiving week.
 So we have raised some cash here
 and we're looking for a bit of a
 pullback to put that cash to work, but
 again, this is just a really
 good time, which is my point is that
 you're going to get a pullback. Now, look,
 the market just could go sideways for a
 week or two, right? It doesn't have to go
 down.
 That's also a correction. Markets don't
 have to decline to technically be a
 correction.
 And, but just having a pullback to, you
 know, either,
 you know, kind of this previous top
 level, maybe even the 50-day moving
 average
 would be great because, you know, the
 markets act like a rubber band
 and, you know, you've had a very strong
 rally here. You've stretched that rubber
 band as far as you can.
 So in order to stretch it again, I need
 to relax it, then I can stretch it again.
 So what you need is a bit of a
 just a reversion in price
 to allow buyers to enter back into the
 markets. You know,
 as we've always talked about before, you
 always think about the market as two
 rooms, buyers and sellers.
 And at some point, everybody that wants
 to sell will have sold or at some point
 everybody that wants to buy
 will buy. And when you get that
 exhaustion on one side or the other,
 right now we're nearing a buyer's
 exhaustion.
 You're going to get a pullback because
 sellers will emerge and kind of
 overwhelm the buyers.
 Okay, hey, just going with your gut
 here. I'm not going to hold to this but
 I'm just curious.
 What are the odds you think we end the
 year at new highs for the year?
 They're pretty decent at this point.
 So, I mean,
 80%, 90%? Okay, yep. So we get,
 you know, if it follows the script you
 think we get some pullback
 but then the rally, the Santa Claus
 rally into the end of the year, you think
 could likely be enough to
 end at new highs for the year?
 Again, you're currently trading at
 45, 56, as we're talking right now
 since I pulled up this chart.
 So you get a pullback to say 44, 86, maybe
 pill 100 points off the market, maybe 150,
 maybe 200, and then this market rallies
 and finishes up towards 4600 by the end
 of the year. Completely logical.
 Okay, okay. So let me
 segue from that, unless there's
 anything else you want to say about
 sort of the general equity market right
 now?
 Okay, keep the chart up for just a
 second here.
 Sorry, go back. Alright, if you can
 pull it up real quick, all I want to just
 reinforce here is that the S&P has
 actually, you know,
 it's done well this year, right?
 So it's been on a relatively,
 I don't want to say steady rise up, but I
 mean it's
 the arc of the year has been up and to
 the right.
 A couple of other important assets.
 One is oil.
 Oil is basically ending the year
 where it started.
 Correct.
 Yeah, and I'm curious, what is that
 telling you right now?
 Some might say that that is
 signs of a recession. Some
 might say it was that nerves got
 over-exaggerated, especially
 recently with the issues going on
 between Israel and the Palestinians,
 but oil is such a
 key input into the economy and the fact
 that it actually hasn't gone anywhere
 this year, I find kind of interesting
 even though the markets have powered
 higher.
 Well, you also have to remember that
 energy stocks were up 60% last year when
 the rest of the market was down 20%.
 So any positive good news
 you could have had for oil was priced in
 last year.
 So, you know, again, so, but yeah, oil
 prices have definitely corrected.
 Remember back in June,
 people were talking about oil is going
 to $150 and I do see $200 barrel oil.
 We actually wrote an article saying
 that's probably not going to be the case.
 You're going to see a pretty decent
 correction in oil. We recommended taking
 profits in oil.
 And that was just because, again,
 technically prices had gotten too
 extended and you're going to get this
 corrective action, which is exactly
 what's happened.
 But look, slower economic growth, which
 we are having,
 is going to lead to lower oil prices
 because oil is a supply demand economy.
 But, you know, prices of oil are driven
 by the futures market.
 So if the futures traders are going, hey,
 I'm looking at
 the economy slowing down here a bit, that
 probably is going to reduce demand for
 oil.
 They're going to sell off oil prices,
 which has been what's happening.
 And again, you know, production is doing
 fine.
 The, you know, the big fear was
 that the Israel conflict was going to
 spark World War III.
 We said that probably wasn't going to be
 the case. It hasn't yet.
 Doesn't mean it can't.
 But again, all this stuff is getting
 priced in pretty quickly
 to the economy. Now, are we going to have a
 recession next year?
 I have no idea, nor does anybody else.
 But, you know, there's certainly a lot of
 evidence that or indicators, I should
 suggest that, you know, like the leading
 economic index, et cetera, that certainly
 suggest that we're going to have a much
 slower rate of economic growth next year.
 Whether or not it's recessionary or not
 has yet to be seen.
 But that if you do have that, you are
 going to see, sorry, you're
 going to see
 slower demand for oil prices, and
 that's going to bring oil prices down.
 Yeah, and it's so interesting, right? So
 totally agree with you. And we can say,
 look, you know, oil
 important leading indicator for the
 market.
 And if we see oil prices going down,
 especially surprising people on the
 downside, that's probably an indicator
 the economy is
 slowing or going to slow.
 Then again, let's say oil was at
 150 dollars a bill right now.
 We'd be talking about how high oil
 prices are the cure for high oil prices
 and that that was going to constrain
 economic growth because the inputs were,
 you know,
 the economic implants were getting too
 expensive. So it is kind of interesting.
 Yeah, but people put way too much
 focus on oil prices. It doesn't have that.
 It's not as big of a driver
 that everybody gives it credence to. I
 mean, you know, if you're trading oil,
 that's great, right?
 But, you know, again, oil, I'm not
 saying oil has no impact,
 but again, when you're talking about
 inflation as an example,
 oil, energy, oil, oil makes up nothing
 of CPI. Oil prices has nothing to do with
 CPI.
 Seven percent of CPI, only seven percent
 of CPI
 is energy. That's utility costs. That is,
 you know,
 heating oil costs. Those type of things
 though, the byproducts of oil prices
 obviously affected by oil prices
 directly. But again, you know,
 it's a very small component of inflation.
 Housing is
 over 30 percent. So, you know,
 you've got to keep this stuff in the
 conflict. So there's a lot of people that
 want to focus on energy prices and go,
 "Oh, look at this. This is happening. This
 is the end of the world."
 Not so much. There's much more important
 indicators outside of that,
 outside of energy prices that are going
 to drive economic activity,
 like retail sales, which is 40 percent of PCE.
 Let me just interject one thing here
 just to get your reaction to it, which is
 you're correct in terms of the direct
 measurement of
 energy input into the CPI calculation,
 but
 oil is a input into everything.
 You talk about housing. Well, I
 mean, you need the oil to
 cut the lumber, ship it to the place. It's
 in everything that goes into the house.
 So I just want to say, I want to
 raise that question, which is, it's
 not just limited to that small slice. It
 does have an impact on everything else,
 maybe less than we think. I don't know.
 I'll let you react to that, but
 that is one unique thing about oil is it
 pretty much is an import
 into almost everything in the
 economy. And it's factored into
 everything else
 because it's factored into the price of
 your house. It's factored into the price
 of your car.
 It's factored into everything, right,
 because it's an input cost. And this is
 why we take a look at producer price
 indexes. You know, again,
 we look at CPI on the consumer side. This
 is what we're spending.
 We also look at PPI, which is what
 producers are spending. And so
 as oil, as the input of oil prices comes
 into the production process,
 that is passed on to consumers.
 And there is a point, and look, and I'm
 not saying there's, and again, don't
 mistake what I'm saying. I'm not saying
 like energy has nothing to do with
 anything. It has, it has everything to do
 with everything.
 It's just not, as a singular indicator,
 the best indicator to look at for a
 major market crash or an
 economic recession.
 It certainly has an impact, but
 it's a much smaller impact than a lot of
 the fear mongers out there want to make
 it.
 This is why they're
 generally wrong.
 Right. Well, and we've talked, we spent
 actually a lot of time last week talking
 a lot about how if you
 invest via the headlines, it's kind of a
 recipe to lose your money
 because the prevailing narrative
 generally always tends to be
 wrong here. Just because you
 mentioned it,
 you know, the importance of indicators,
 there's one indicator that we hardly
 ever talked about anymore. We talked
 about it an awful lot when it first came
 on the scene,
 which was the inverted yield curve. Right.
 Right. I mean, it's just, it's kind of
 like we just accept that we just live
 under an inverted yield curve these
 days because you now had it for so long.
 And I know you've said, hey, it's not the
 inversion that gets you, it's the
 un-inversion. And so I guess until the
 un-inversion happens,
 we just won't really spend that much
 time talking about it. But it is kind of
 amazing that we've had
 so many inverted yield curves for this
 long.
 And it's kind of like I live out here in
 California. Right. And
 we all know theoretically that the big
 one could happen at any minute. Right.
 But you just can't live without hanging
 over your head. So the thing we talked
 the least about out here in terms of
 risks
 is earthquakes. We'll talk about fire
 risk. We'll talk about floods. We'll talk
 about a whole bunch of other things.
 But we've just kind of given up
 worrying about the big one because we
 just it's so out of our control and it's
 just been hanging around forever. Right.
 And the inverted yield curve is not
 beginning to kind of feel like that.
 Well, but see, this is another narrative.
 You know, when the
 inverted yield curve happened, all you
 heard was people talking about, oh,
 recession is coming, recession is coming.
 And
 you and I were talking about things like,
 hey, it's not the
 it's not the inversion. It's the
 un-inversion that matters. And the longer
 that it's there,
 the less that people give credence. Oh,
 well, it's wrong this time. This time is
 different.
 And we're still inverted. We still have
 an un-inverted the yield curve.
 We're getting closer,
 but we haven't un-inverted it yet. And
 that probably isn't going to happen
 until
 next year. And then we'll see
 kind of what happens from there. But I
 still wouldn't discount
 that the un-inversion of the yield curve
 doesn't
 relate to much slower economic activity
 at that point.
 Yeah, well, that's because I'm bringing
 it up, which is it still has a great
 track record. So you talk about
 indicators that have a really good track
 record. The inverted yield curve
 is one of them.
 We've just been stuck on inversion for
 so long.
 We've kind of just gotten used to it or
 forgotten about it. Well, again,
 this is the problem with the markets
 though, right? So we talk about valuations
 as a good example.
 This is, you know, CAPE valuations are a
 great example of market narrative.
 So once we hit 25 -- Can you define CAPE
 for folks that don't understand it?
 It's the
 Dr. Robert Schiller's version of smooth
 valuations uses 10 years worth of
 earnings to create a valuation called
 the sickly adjusted PE ratio.
 And so it all is, it smooths out the
 year-to-year volatility of earnings
 changes. That's all it is. But anyway,
 you know, whenever, you know, PEs hit
 25 or 30 or whatever the number is,
 you'll see a whole bunch of articles
 coming out saying, "Oh,
 markets are overvalued. This means a
 decade of low returns are coming
 up." And so if the markets don't
 immediately crash and go to zero,
 everybody goes, "Oh, well, see that it
 didn't matter because, you know,
 valuations is different this time."
 It's not different. Evaluations do
 matter. And look, we've already spent,
 you know, the last time that we had
 30, 35 times earnings was about two
 years ago, and we've had two years with
 zero returns. So on a total basis,
 right? So we still haven't set new
 highs, new all-time highs for the
 market. So we've been in this grind for
 two years trading sideways. If next
 year's another kind of sideways years,
 there's three. You know, so, you know,
 that's what valuations mean. But
 evaluations as a narrative doesn't
 manifest itself into an immediate 40%
 downside in the market, then it's
 wrong. And this is why you've got to be
 really super careful about narratives
 and taking a look at it and saying,
 "This is grabbing headline attention
 right now because if it bleeds, it
 leads." We talked about that last
 week. You know, focus on what's
 happening underneath the surface. And
 this is why it's important to pay
 attention to the technicals of the
 market relative to these big macro
 views, because macro views are very
 hard to get right because things
 change over time and markets adapt
 and economies adapt. And you can
 point to this one particular thing
 and say, "Well, every time this has
 happened, you've had a depression."
 Markets and economies and governments
 and central banks, they're all
 adapting to this stuff to try to keep
 that stuff from happening again. So
 just be careful, these big macro
 narratives that says, "We're about
 to have this major 50% crash in the
 market because of the debt, because
 nobody wants to buy our debt, whatever
 it is." And then the central bank
 comes up and starts buying everything
 under the sun. That's going to
 completely shaft that narrative of
 whatever you thought it was going to
 be. Right. And I think oil is a great
 example of that. Look, I'm on the
 train that says, "Look, over the arc of
 the rest of our lives, oil is going to
 become more expensive." There's a
 whole host of reasons that I can lay out
 here and have with previous guests
 about why that's likely to happen. But
 if you just sort of shove all your money
 into expecting an oil price north of
 150 bucks a barrel, you're likely going
 to get killed many, many times along the
 way because it's a highly volatile
 commodity. That's a great point
 because remember in 2007, we had peak
 oil. Right. And your narrative
 was exactly the narrative back in 2007.
 We're running out of oil. We can't
 produce any more oil. The population is
 growing, all these reasons. And we're
 going to have for the rest of the
 next 100 years, it's going to be high
 oil prices above $100 a barrel. You
 better get used to it. And then we
 found this thing called fracking and
 oil prices went to 20 bucks a barrel.
 So, you know, and then again, just not
 that long ago, 2021, you know, we're
 running up in oil prices. Everybody's
 talking about 150, $200 barrel oil. You
 better get used to it. And we have
 negative oil prices. So, you know, you
 got to be so careful about these
 demographic narratives or these big
 long-term macro outlooks because things
 change. People invent new technologies.
 And the peak oil theory was probably
 right until they invented fracking. And
 that changed the game. Yeah. A couple of
 things. They didn't invent fracking in
 2008. They just applied new technologies.
 But you're going to get pushback in the
 comments, which is why. The point is,
 that's when fracking became a thing. It
 was a freaking miracle. And it saved the
 world as we knew it. Yeah, fracking
 been around before that, but nobody was
 using it. But again, this is, you know,
 but this is the point. And we're going
 to invent new technologies. You know,
 we've got AI now, which has been
 around for a decade, but now people are
 starting to actually use it. And that's
 the thing is like, we can invent these
 technologies. They may be on a
 shelf for a decade and somebody's going
 to find the use for it that changes
 something. You know, the metaverse,
 you know, it was a really hot thing two
 years ago. Now nobody Googles it anymore.
 But at some point, somebody may figure
 out a reason how the metaverse is going
 to change something and it'll become a
 thing and it's going to change the world
 as we know it. We probably will live in
 a ready player one society at some point,
 as depressing as that sounds. But the
 point I'm making, which is a little bit
 nuanced compared to what I think you're
 saying, but I think you agree with me is
 let's say for a moment that I'm right,
 that the peak cheap oil folks are right
 in the long run, right? And I guess you,
 I'm gonna think maybe you might think
 the same thing. If you don't, let me know.
 But like, you can have the correct
 long-term view, but you've got to be very
 careful how you position yourself
 because like I said, you can just get
 slaughtered multiple times along the way
 there, right? And then that's why I don't
 have long-term views. And long-term views
 are terrible for managing your money.
 Your view should be three months, maybe
 six months at the most. You can't survive
 five years. You know, it's great to think
 that you can invest in something, hold it
 for five years, you won't because as soon
 as it crashes on you, and it will for one
 reason or the other, you're going to sell
 it out at the bottom and then the market's
 going to rally back and then you're going
 to be pissed off that the market rallied
 back without you because it's all a rigged
 game now. And then you're going to buy
 back in at the high and get slammed again
 and then pretty much you'll quit investing
 after that and be done and move on. That's
 what happens to 80% of investors, right?
 So having a long-term, you know, when you
 listen to stuff about long-term macro
 views that are going to occur over 10 or
 20 years, I don't care. Don't email emails
 from people like these long emails about
 stuff and over the next 20 years, it's
 going to happen. It's like, I don't care.
 I'm managing money to make money right
 now. I may not be around in 20 years. I'm
 old. So, you know, I've got to make money
 right now. And again, there's so, my point
 is, is so many things can happen. You know,
 yeah, we're, you know, we're all depending
 on oil today. I don't know in 20 years, do
 we even need oil anymore? Do we all shift
 over to nuclear? I'm not saying we are,
 right? But do we all shift over to nuclear
 and hydrogen or natural gas, whatever it
 is? I don't know. And I can't, I can't
 predict that far out. No one else can either.
 All right. But this was a great segue
 because it's exactly where I was taking
 this. So there is a big bull market going
 on right now in uranium, right? And there
 were people out there who successfully
 said over the past several years, look,
 things are changing in the nuclear space,
 right? Countries are beginning to realize
 that nuclear is just going to have to be
 part of the mix going forward. There's
 some dynamics that went around this, the
 supply situation in the uranium market,
 given Japan taking its nuclear fleet
 offline post Fukushima and then bringing
 it back online recently. So the glut that
 was there is now gone and so it took
 longer, I think, than many of them
 expected but it finally has kicked in,
 right? So how do you match
 something like that where you are taking
 more of a strategic play in the portfolio
 of like, "Hey, I do believe there's a big
 trend that will catch on at some point in
 time and I want to have some exposure to
 that if it indeed does happen versus I
 just have my three month to six month
 kind of tunnel vision?" Well, if you have
 this view of something that you think is
 going to play out over a long term, then
 buy a very, very small investment
 in it. It's less than 1% of your
 portfolio and let it sit there. And if it
 goes to zero, no big deal. It's 1% of your
 portfolio. If it starts to work, you add to
 it and then as it continues to work, you
 keep building the position. So
 just do it strategically and
 also, too, by having a very
 small weight in it,
 if it does go to zero, you're not up all
 night figuring out why you lost all your
 money, right? It's a very small weight in
 your portfolio and it's there. That's
 fine, right? You can always play with some
 Vegas money. That's a great way to think
 about it is also like if I was
 going to go to Vegas and play Blackjack,
 how much money would I take, right? And
 don't lie to me and don't lie to
 yourself and say, "Oh, I'd take $10,000."
 If you think that's the case,
 get on a plane, fly to Vegas, and see how
 much money you actually take with you
 and how much you actually bet
 at the table. That's how much you take
 home, yeah.
 Yeah, well, no, not that. It's just that
 when the money hits the table,
 right, that's when it gets real
 and it's easy to delude yourself and say,
 "Oh, well, if I was going to go to Vegas
 and gamble, I'm going to bet $10,000."
 Okay, BS, first of all, but secondly,
 even if you are,
 $10,000 to you may be nothing, right?
 You may have $50 million in the bank,
 so a $10,000 bet is nominal, right?
 That may be nothing. So it's got to be
 relative to what you would be willing to
 lose, and you can bet that because that's
 all you're doing at this point is just
 betting on some future outcome that you
 have absolutely no control over,
 and that's the very basis of speculating.
 So you never bet more than you're willing
 to lose, and you expect it to go to zero.
 All right, so for you to make money,
 awesome.
 So this is actually a really
 relevant discussion for, I think, a lot
 of viewers here because I think from my
 understanding of having been in
 communication with these folks for
 several years, there is a proclivity to
 prefer hard assets for a whole bunch of
 reasons. People are saying I think they
 are going to appreciate on a relative
 basis better than a lot of other assets
 going forward and they've been in a
 long downtrend and you hear the talk
 about a commodity super cycle and stuff
 like that. So again, I can make a really
 detailed case for why hard assets will
 probably relatively outperform over the
 next 10 years.
 What I'm hearing from you saying is, "Hey,
 great if that's your point of view,
 but don't just throw all your money into
 that and then cross your fingers and
 hope this thing you have no control over
 happens. It is make the position prove
 itself to you. So take a foundational
 point position, one that you can sleep
 with, that if you're wrong you're not
 going to be destitute, and then if and as
 the market starts
 performing the way that you think it
 will, you start adding into that almost
 like adding kindling to the initial
 spark of a fire and then eventually
 you're adding logs once it really
 gets going.
 And then know when to sell. That's the
 other side of it.
 I've seen more people over time that
 they get the bet right and then never
 sell and they wind up losing it all. So
 it's just important to know when to buy
 as it is when to sell.
 That's going to be part of this
 discussion that we hope we get to in a
 bit because there's some great words of
 wisdom on that.
 Yeah, but I mean that's how every great
 investor makes money over time and
 survives.
 Explain to me why
 we've had three major bull markets
 since 1980 and 80% of people have less
 than $500 in bank. Yeah, part of it is the
 fact that they don't save and part invest,
 but even most investors haven't made a
 lot of money in the financial markets.
 And the reason is because they
 constantly do the wrong things. They bet
 on narratives.
 They don't manage their risk. They do
 everything backwards. They
 sell low and buy high because
 it's all the emotions and other things
 that go into it. And these narratives are
 great,
 but have your
 narrative that somebody's yelling at
 you. And again, most people don't do the
 research. They just hear some guy on some
 channel on some TV
 says, "Oh, I think hard assets are going
 to be the thing to be in for the next
 20 years.
 So, you better go buy your stuff now." And
 by the way, I happen to sell this
 very commodity. So, if you need to buy
 gold, give me a call because I'll sell it
 to you.
 Be careful of who's pitching
 you these narratives.
 And do A, do they have skin in the game?
 But B,
 are they actually talking to, is it
 in your best interest? Does it fit within
 your financial goals? Does it fit within
 your time frame?
 It's great to be right about a
 narrative, but if you died 10 years
 before it happened, it wasn't great.
 Right. I mean, we talk a lot
 and we're talking a lot today
 about the emotional
 pitfalls to being a successful
 investor. And the reason why is
 because
 they generally tend to be the biggest
 obstacles of success for a lot of
 investors. But I really enjoy
 when I bring,
 when I get to talk to a behavioral
 economist, someone like a Peter
 Atwater or Dan Ariely, who I've had on
 the program and I'm always trying to
 get more on.
 I think it might be fun for one of these
 weekly market recaps for me to bring one
 of those guys on
 and just for us and I'd love to sort of
 see you and them be in conversation
 because they tend to be more on sort of
 the academic side. They have all
 the studies, they have sort of all the
 rules and principles and then you've got
 all like the
 the practical experience,
 what happens on the street
 when the trades are getting
 made, you see the people actually making
 the emotionally charged decisions.
 That would be a really interesting
 combination I think. Is that
 something you'd be open for?
 Yeah, of course.
 Alright, well folks watching, if you'd
 like to see that, let me know in the
 comment section below and if
 interest is high enough then I'll work
 on trying to make that happen going
 forward. But I think that could be really
 interesting because
 we talk a lot about the charts, we talk a
 lot about the macro stuff.
 To actually have a behavioral expert
 in here to be able to riff with you off
 of that I think would be really useful
 for folks.
 That'd be fun, definitely.
 What would be fun about that,
 and this is a nice segue to where I'm
 going next, is
 we just had Thoughtful Money's first
 debate. I don't like to use the term
 debate for what just went on
 but we had Matt Piepenburg and Brent
 Johnson talking about the future of the
 dollar.
 It wasn't like a bare-knuckle brawl.
 They weren't at each other's throats. It
 really was like a co-exploration
 of the topic. In fact, they agreed
 on much more than they disagreed on but
 they did have some very important
 fundamental differences of perspective
 and I think folks just really enjoyed
 watching two smart intelligent people
 sort of dissect the topic respectfully
 and ping-ponging back and
 forth and building off of each other.
 Again, it wasn't the sort of teardown
 type of mudsling fest that
 you see in a lot of other debate
 channels. So it wasn't a presidential
 debate is what you're saying? It was
 definitely not a presidential debate.
 Yeah, no, it was much more
 genteel than that and I'd love to do more
 of this sort of
 genteel exploration of topics
 in the future.
 But they were talking about the future
 of the dollar. That's just one other -- I
 just want to get your thoughts on this.
 It doesn't have to be long but that's
 another asset that pretty much
 it's kind of gone everywhere but
 it's ending the year where it started
 here.
 As a capital manager, what if any
 impart that has for you, import?
 The dollar has a lot of impact in terms
 of not only
 economic outcomes but as well as
 other impacts to financial conditions,
 etc. So it's a key component of financial
 conditions.
 So it's very important. Again,
 we go back and people want to --
 this is another -- so like energy, the
 dollar is another one of those hot topics
 and
 again it's not
 the topics range
 from the dollar's dead, nobody wants the
 dollar to
 the other side of the
 coin as well but
 at the end of the day the dollar is very
 important to imports and exports and so
 we're going to maintain
 in some aspect a relative balance to
 other currencies in the world. So again,
 if our dollar gets too expensive or if our
 dollar gets too cheap, it has an impact
 on our economy.
 So we're going to adjust the value of
 that dollar relative to the Chinese yuan
 or to the Japanese yen, etc.
 And it's the same thing with China and
 same thing with Japan, they're going to
 do the same thing because
 70% of transactions are handled in the
 U.S. dollar, that's not going anywhere
 anytime soon,
 not in our lifetimes anyway. And so just
 understanding the impact
 and importance of the dollar relative to
 financial conditions
 will give you a better insight as to
 what the potential
 impact to the economic outcome is going
 to be.
 Do you have any particular
 sense guesstimate expectation portfolio
 assumptions about what the dollar is
 going to do next year?
 At this point I would argue
 that in
 somewhere between the beginning of 2024
 and mid-2024 the dollar is going to get
 stronger.
 That's going to be a function of
 A. The Fed is going to have to
 tighten financial conditions which when
 they start to do that we're going to see
 some flight to safety
 at that point which is going to help
 boost the dollar a bit because money
 will flow into the dollar then into
 treasuries so yields will go down
 and ultimately the dollar will get
 stronger.
 But again there's a lot of variability
 to that and so trying to make a
 prediction six months out is kind of
 futile but
 my guess is from where we are right now
 given the amount of the sell-off we've
 had the dollar that the next
 trend of the dollar at least in the next
 six months is probably going to either
 be sideways or higher.
 I'm going to
 trundle over into your view on
 treasuries, your latest up interview on
 treasuries in a second.
 Because we're talking about currency
 there is another bull market going on
 right now and it's one that we don't
 talk about all that much
 but I just want to get any thoughts that
 you may have on it which is Bitcoin.
 Bitcoin's now back up at
 37,000 so it is
 more than doubled I think from the lows.
 All of a sudden all the Bitcoiners and
 digital currency folks are
 back out there
 crowing and hey to a certain extent you
 doubled your money in a short period of
 time. Good on you.
 What I find really interesting --
 If you bought the lows.
 If you bought the lows, yeah, and one of
 the things I find really interesting is
 there have been some really big scandals
 in the crypto space this year. We
 had FTX with Sam Altman and that
 was somewhat coincident with the lows.
 But then just this past week we had
 the largest crypto exchange Binance
 just hit by the SEC with -- I don't know,
 can't remember how many billions
 in fees for --
 I don't even know exactly what it was --
 money laundering and a few other
 violations and stuff like that.
 So there clearly is a lot of
 cleanup that still needs to happen in
 things are getting cleaned up or
 it's basically Bitcoin is a risk asset
 there's a very high correlation between Bitcoin and
 the financial markets because it's a
 risk asset.
 And as such when people are
 taking on a lot of risk
 they buy Bitcoin for the risk and so
 you've had a very nice run in it.
 I've owned Bitcoin now, I can't remember
 when I made my first purchase, but
 basically over the last three years, four
 years, however long it's been, last time
 that Bitcoin was at $37,000 I've made no
 money. So you go back and
 again we talk about these bear markets
 that occur over time.
 Bear markets aren't the fact that
 something goes down constantly over time.
 It's the fact that over time you make
 no money.
 So if you look back over the last few
 years you've made no money with Bitcoin
 as an example. That's a bear market, right?
 Yeah, you've had this terrific rally off
 the lows, but now Bitcoin's got to go to
 $80,000 to start being in a
 technically kind of a new bull market.
 So again, this is just
 kind of one of those other things.
 Yeah, Bitcoin's doing great. You've had a
 great rally. I'm glad, finally, because
 I'm almost back to break even
 on some of my positions and maybe in
 another 10 years I'll actually make some
 money on it. I don't know.
 We'll see, but there was
 an experiment when I bought it
 way back when. It was an experiment. I'm
 still holding it. We'll see how it works
 out.
 Experiment personal or do you actually
 hold any for clients?
 Oh no, absolutely not. This is not an
 asset you'd ever put in a client account.
 No, I just-- it's a personal, yeah,
 experiment because I wanted to learn
 more about it, how it worked, how it
 responds to markets,
 how it responds to economic data, responds
 to all these type of things. And look,
 we've been saying for years that, you
 know, I think you and I had this
 discussion that at some point the SEC is
 going to regulate, you know,
 cryptocurrencies. It's happening. And the
 function is who's going to actually
 survive the regulations will be the next
 big kind of winner. So, you know, I think
 you've got to either be in Bitcoin or
 Ethereum. Those are only two right now
 that, you know, I can see surviving the
 regulatory environment. Maybe there's
 some others.
 But, you know, we're starting to see, you
 know, what's happening now is these
 regulations get put into place. We're
 starting to see all the roaches in the
 kitchen.
 All right, so just interesting because
 you brought it up. So,
 you've held it now for a couple of years.
 Has your opinion on its prospects
 changed in any material way over that
 period of time?
 No, because there's still not a-- there's
 still not a viable use for it.
 You know, that's the-- that's the thing.
 You know, everybody keeps saying that, oh,
 Bitcoin is going to be a replacement for
 the currency. It's not.
 It's going to take the place of the
 dollar. It's not.
 You know, it's going to take over all
 these transactions. It hasn't.
 So, yeah, you can, you know, at some point
 you can maybe
 transact Bitcoin for, you know, an NFT or
 whatever it is. That's fine.
 But, you know, companies that went out
 said, hey, I'll take Bitcoin for my
 product. They quit because the value of
 the drop is too volatile.
 So at some point, if Bitcoin is going to
 be anything other than just basically a
 risk asset, because that's all it is
 right now, it's just people buy it,
 hopefully to make some money.
 It's got to have some type of valid use
 and we'll have to see
 if-- and that's why I'm still holding it
 because, again, you know, I'm going to
 hold it. It's a-- let me be clear. It's a
 very small percentage. If it goes to
 zero, it's my Vegas money. It doesn't
 matter.
 You know, but, you know, at some point
 it's going to have to find its place
 if it's going to be a valid instrument
 to where we can, you know, use it for
 transactions and I don't have to convert
 it back to the dollar
 in order to use it. So, you know, we've
 got to get there and maybe there's
 something on the horizon, kind of like
 the metaverse with, you know, with meta.
 Maybe at some point the metaverse will
 be, you know, have a really strong valid
 use and
 it'll be a dominant thing. I
 have no idea and, again, I can't predict
 that far in the future so I don't even
 try.
 Got it. Okay. Well, I'm sure we're
 going to get a ton of
 feedback from whatever Bitcoin and
 crypto folks are watching this right now
 but we're used to it.
 Just go for it because, again, I don't
 have, you know, I don't have any real,
 you know, dog in the hunt. So,
 again, I'm just trying to make money for
 my clients and myself personally and so
 that's, again, these are all great topics
 but, again, nobody knows and if anybody
 knew with certainty
 there would be just, you know, if people
 could know with certainty the future
 then everybody would be wealthy. We
 wouldn't have 80% of the population
 living paycheck to paycheck, right?
 So, nobody knows and I think it's a
 complete waste of your viewers time
 and a complete waste of your time to
 spend your time focusing on these big
 long-term macro views that have nothing
 to do
 with the price of sliced bread today.
 Okay.
 Well, I'm going to talk about views that
 are going to maybe impact us next year,
 not necessarily tomorrow, but this is
 back to where bonds and yields
 are likely to go. You and your partner,
 Michael Leibovitz,
 I believe, are still very much on
 the train. That's a
 very good time to be buying bonds.
 You're increasing the duration that
 you're going out on. I'm primarily talking
 about treasury bonds here.
 While you
 were doing that, I went and looked up my
 first purchase of Bitcoin was
 in December of 2018.
 Alright, so you've been hodling since then?
 I've been hodling since 2018, yes.
 Okay.
 Time flies. I didn't realize it had been
 that long. It had been that long, yeah.
 It's six years, practically, right now,
 getting close to that.
 Alright, well, look,
 I had Jesse Felder on the program
 recently and he
 raised the concern that
 we could go into recession next year
 and that could actually send interest
 rates and bond yields higher and his
 logic there is, if I remember correctly,
 was that right now there's a
 supply-demand imbalance as he sees it in
 the treasury market where supply has
 really grown, demand has been weaker.
 If we go into recession, that will crater
 tax receipts,
 making the issues we have with the
 current deficit
 even more stark, more visible,
 and that bondholders -- and that gets
 made worse if inflation remains sticky
 through this point in time. His
 argument doesn't depend on that but it
 gets exacerbated if inflation remains
 sticky and he basically says under those
 conditions
 the bond
 buyers are going to demand higher yields
 because of that,
 and I'm just curious what you think.
 There's no historical evidence to
 support that thesis.
 Okay.
 Period? Period.
 Period. Move on?
 No, I mean if you have a recession, yields
 go down with recession because yields are
 a function of inflation, economic growth,
 and ultimately wages, so that's
 what drives yields. Again, what
 drives yields? It's whether or not
 I can loan money at a certain price over
 time and
 you know, bond buyers who are buying
 those bonds
 are the ones looking out saying okay if I
 buy the bond today then what's my rate
 of return going to be at this certain
 date in the future?
 And that's what's basing it on yields and
 of course at that point if you have a
 recession, if you have an economic slow
 down, if you have
 any type of impact to the financial
 markets, guess who's going to be your
 number one bond buyer?
 Well, that'll be the Fed if the Fed
 actually steps back in at that point in
 time, right?
 And they will because that is their
 tools.
 Jerome Powell has been very clear. He's
 not worried about a recession. Why is he
 not worried about a recession to his
 quote? Because he knows how to fix it.
 But no, his quote, "We have the tools to
 deal with that."
 In other words, that's cut interest
 rates to zero.
 If they cut interest rates to zero, the
 long end will follow, inflation will
 fall because you have a
 recession, less economic demand,
 and that's going to lead to lower yields.
 So there is no scenario
 where you can have spiking yields in
 recession. That never occurs.
 Let me ask you this. Might that occur for
 a while this time
 before Powell goes into rescue mode?
 Might he let the pain
 prolong for longer than normal because
 we've had the Fed on a hair trigger for
 so many years.
 We finally don't.
 Because as soon as we had a bank
 crisis back in March they immediately
 started the bank term funding program.
 Yeah, but that wasn't a recession. That
 of the business cycle. Well, we haven't
 because the Fed's been on a hair trigger.
 There you go. Why do you think that's
 going to change if you have a recession?
 Well, for the reasons you're saying,
 we're Powell saying, "I know how to deal
 with that so I want to get inflation lower."
 A recession is a threat to financial
 stability. They are going to support that
 financial stability.
 Just for the purposes of debate here,
 totally agree, but so is inflation.
 And so he's trying to get inflation
 subdued and so that might let him
 let the system take more pain as long as
 it's run-of-the-mill recession pain.
 If the banking system's in jeopardy,
 different story.
 Sure. So yeah, let's say inflation runs
 along and say they can't run along
 at three and a half percent, it's got
 to run to two, which he's already
 noticed. He's already stated in his last
 meeting that basically bond yields
 and the stock market at that point
 was doing the work for the Fed of
 tightening monetary conditions. Now, this
 is one thesis that we've been
 talking a lot about over the last couple
 of weeks, is that the stock market, the
 bond market are kind of screwing
 themselves at this point because the
 dropping yields and the run-up in stock
 prices are loosening financial
 conditions. So I expect at the December
 meeting that the Federal Reserve is not
 going to make a statement of any type
 that they are done hiking rates. They are
 going to leave that one more rate hike
 out on the table because they need to
 tighten up financial conditions. So I
 would expect in the near term to see
 interest rates go back up, bond yield,
 bond prices come down. That's why we
 recently took a little bit of profit off
 our trading position in our bond
 portfolio because bonds have gotten a
 bit ahead of themselves. They're
 overbought just like the stock market, so
 expect a reversal. But again, when you
 start talking about the bigger macro
 picture, if you get into a recession, the
 Fed will cut rates and if there is any
 type of real lack of demand, which there
 is not for bonds, foreign
 buyers have been buying at the
 same pace they were basically back in
 2000. If there's any real lack of
 demand, then the Federal Reserve will
 step in and buy the excess.
 I'm going to just sort of
 remake this point because I think
 it's potential, which is that
 until and unless inflation is at two or
 close enough to two where the Fed can
 say, "All right, what I've been
 working on for the past couple years, I
 did," I think they will pivot if we get
 into a recession but I think they are
 going to wait for the world to come to
 them on bended knee to say, "Fed, please
 pivot. I know inflation's still at
 three or two, nine or whatever but we
 need you to do this." Sounds like you get
 a different opinion. No, they just won't
 wait that long. I mean it won't be the
 world coming because again, if the world's
 coming to them on bended knee, you're in
 a financial crisis. But the world's
 already coming to them on bended.
 They're getting letters from the
 mortgage lenders and the NAR, please.
 It's already starting. I know and so I
 guess what you mean by bended
 need. If you're talking about the
 financial system under massive strain
 they're not going to wait that long.
 No, but I think they're going to wait for
 the political air cover. I mean it
 might be Biden coming and saying,
 "I'm demanding that the Fed
 reverse course or whatever," right?
 And Trump did in 2018.
 Yeah.
 Right, because Trump was, "We should
 fire Jerome Powell. He's screwing
 everything up. We were down 20% in the
 market then." And he did pivot.
 He did eventually pivot.
 And there was no crisis. There was
 no recession and he pivoted, right?
 Of course, we didn't realize at the time
 that the hedge fund economy was blowing
 up, but there was no technical
 recession and he's cut race to zero in
 June of 2019. So it doesn't
 have to be this environment. But the
 bottom line though is that if the
 economy is slowing into recession, you
 can't have inflation. Why? Because
 inflation is supply and demand in the
 economy. So if you have a recession,
 that slower economic growth, that means
 you have less demand, inflation comes
 down, that's just a function of how it
 works. And if inflation comes
 down, yields come down because yields
 track inflation. They don't stay
 detached from each other.
 Yeah, and this is where I think 2024 is
 going to be a really interesting year. I
 just think that there's a lot that can
 happen this year and we've got enough
 disagreement. It's funny,
 2022, they were all watching in
 sort of disbelief, like nobody thought
 the market could just keep grinding down
 like that. 2023, everybody was convinced
 we're going to have a recession. Market
 shocked everybody. 2024, I feel like
 there's much more disagreement
 about what could happen here,
 but just to note one prediction,
 David Rosenberg said that we'll have a
 one handle on inflation on the CPI by
 the end of 2024. That'll be really
 interesting to see. I can definitely see
 the potential for that happening. I think
 maybe you can too,
 but if it does, it's going to make a
 real interesting year.
 Yeah, well look, I have no idea what next
 year is going to be. I mean
 there's no guarantee we'll have a
 recession next year. There's no guarantee
 we'll have a recession period.
 There's some things that are going on.
 So let me put it this way.
 So yields have come down. Already mortgage
 applications are increasing. Home
 prices are ticking up. Consumer confidence
 will improve because of lower interest
 rates. The stock market going up
 increases consumer confidence. So they go
 out and spend more money.
 So that postpones having a recession
 because you now have this impetus of
 lower yields impacting the consumer,
 which is now going out to spend more
 money. That's inflationary, by the way.
 So now you have this uptick in
 inflation. Yields go back up. That gets
 the Fed on their, you know, back on the
 problem of monetary policy being too
 tight. So they start trying to talk down
 the market again,
 which then drives the yields, you know,
 yields down and the stock market down,
 which then impacts consumer confidence,
 which then begins to weigh on the
 economy. You see the problem,
 right? And this is going to be 2024.
 Nobody has any freaking clue what's
 going to happen.
 Neither do I. That's why we just have to
 navigate it for what it is.
 Exactly. And so just on the topic of
 recession, you know, we talk a lot
 about the potential here.
 I believe it's still your base case,
 despite you not knowing. I don't put
 words in your mouth to change that. I
 will say it's my base case.
 There's just
 one sort of recession watch data point
 on this program. I've known John for many,
 many years,
 and one of his sort of recessionary
 indicators that he has
 looked at for years, I mean, since the
 '08 recession,
 is RV sales.
 So he looked, you know, it's the ultimate
 toy that you don't need, right? And
 everybody buys it when times are flush
 and then it's one of the first things to
 go right when times are bad.
 And we're finally actually seeing some
 some real deterioration in that market.
 And let me see if I can share my screen
 here real fast.
 The pandemic motorhome bubble burst with
 RV sales down 49%
 year to date.
 So we're definitely seeing some
 real crazy, you know, the froth is coming
 off the sales,
 and of course during the pandemic era
 everybody wanted an RV and then when the
 when the stimulus checks were going out,
 you know, people were using them to buy
 RVs and RV prices went to the moon,
 and then revenge travel happened and
 that was a mechanism by people who were
 doing revenge travel.
 Here's a tweet that just came out
 which basically says,
 "Hey, you remember that expensive
 trendy thing that everybody was buying?"
 When that starts showing up on Facebook
 marketplace everywhere,
 like that's the beginning that the top
 is probably in, right? And people are
 starting to see stress.
 He says, "I received a call about two
 years ago from a custom van build-out
 contractor looking for a new line of
 work. He said his business had gone flat.
 That was a lead indicator to confirm we
 were at a housing top."
 Then he's got this great point, "When 25%
 of the vehicles headed towards the
 mountain are a hundred thousand dollars
 or more custom vans,
 it's probably time to sell."
 So we do seem to be maybe seeing one
 sort of classic recessionary indicator
 here is that
 the money on fund is beginning
 to dry up.
 Right, but see that's the big
 driver for all of this, right?
 So people talk about
 the federal reserve. So if the federal
 reserve starts buying bonds, that's
 inflationary, right? That's not
 inflationary because it's an asset swap.
 The difference is that we
 sent checks to households and we gave
 people money and
 remember back then too in 2020 it was
 all about the fire movement,
 which was the financial independence
 retire early.
 So everybody was going to save up
 $300,000, they're going to throw it
 all into the market, make eight percent
 of their money every year, go live in a
 van down by the river,
 and that was going to be the new life.
 Interesting article out last week is now
 millennials are going to what's called
 soft saving. In other words, they're not
 saving at all for retirement. It's all
 about
 living life now because life
 sucks. You might as well enjoy it
 while it's here because it's
 just not going to ever get better.
 So now they've gone from
 fire to
 smoke, right? So now we're not going to
 save anything.
 But that's all
 a function of when you inject too much
 capital into an economy. You have people
 that are
 typically non-responsible capital to
 spend, they go out and they make stupid
 purchases.
 And so it's interesting that
 retail RV sells down 49 percent. Well,
 you got to kind of put that into
 perspective. I don't have the numbers in
 front of me, but
 if I sold, if I normally sell five RVs a
 year, I'm just picking numbers,
 and then pandemic checks go out so I sell
 10,
 right? And then just go back to normal,
 which is five, I'm down 50 percent of my
 sales,
 right? So, you know,
 these headlines are great, but again, I
 haven't looked at the RV sales, right? But
 I need to strip out that anomaly
 of RV sales to understand what the trend
 of RV sales is in a normal economic
 environment. And is that
 indicating a recession or not, right? You
 mentioned tax receipts earlier. Tax
 receipts are down large last year.
 Normally that means a recession, but
 we're not in a recession. So
 what's going on? Why am I getting this
 big drop in tax receipts?
 So those are the things
 that we need to know because we created
 so many anomalies from 2020 to 2022
 that are now coming out of the system as
 that pig in the python works it the way
 through.
 We've got to start fleshing some of this
 out to see what normal actually looks
 like.
 They've distorted the comparisons. Yeah,
 we're not in one. David Rosenberg,
 he would say, "Well, we might be in one,"
 and the reason why he says that is
 because he thinks GDI
 is a much more accurate teller of
 the tail than GDP given how GDP is
 calculated,
 and GDI is much more closer to recession
 than GDP is.
 Yeah, but I don't disagree with
 David on that point. He's right, but there
 was this big gap between GDP and GDI
 and everybody said, "Well, we get the
 revisions, that GDP number is going to
 collapse towards GDI
 and we're going to be in a recession."
 Well, when we got the revision,
 GDI was done.
 So again,
 this is my point, you got to be so
 careful with this data because again,
 the revisions will kill you.
 Yeah. Hey, one point talking about the
 stimulus, the different types of
 stimulus, another thing David talked
 about was
 one of the things that pushed out the
 arrival of the recession -- he thinks
 the recession should have happened a
 while ago and it just keeps getting
 pushed out, one because the pig
 in the python was way bigger than we
 all could have fathomed,
 but he also said that the savings rate
 has dropped so low. This is not just the
 youngest generations doing soft saving. I
 mean it's kind of everybody and he
 said that that has basically acted as a
 stimulus to the economy where we just
 decided to save less. We've ratcheted
 that savings rate down so stuff is still
 going into the economy that otherwise
 wouldn't be in a normal year.
 You combine that with the increase that
 we're seeing in revolving credit where
 people are --
 people don't like to have to change until
 the pain -- they don't change until the pain
 of not changing
 outweighs the pain of change.
 So they keep the lifestyle going and to
 make that happen they start decreasing
 their savings and then they start
 putting it on the plastic and you
 can do that for a period of time but not
 forever.
 You and I have talked about this
 before. You take a look at things like
 disability claims.
 All of a sudden we have a
 financial crisis and everybody goes on
 to disability.
 So we have and they go take
 out student loans even though they're
 not even going to college and all
 these type of things.
 So what we know about the
 consumer, and David's absolutely right
 about this, is that they are very creative
 in coming up with ways to spend money.
 They don't, to your point, you know, I
 don't want to change my lifestyle
 not until the pain becomes
 too great because they'll even suffer
 through the pain.
 They just will suffer through until it's
 no longer possible
 to maintain that lifestyle and then
 they'll start
 doing something different. But you know
 it's when you reach the point that
 the credit gets shut off
 and there is no more access to more
 money then they'll have to start making
 changes but until they get to that point
 it's amazing how far
 consumers will dig themselves into a
 hole to maintain a lifestyle they really
 can't afford.
 Can't afford. It's so interesting.
 There's so many of the
 macro trends that we look at that really
 at the end of the day just
 they reduce to an exercise of how long
 can it can be kicked.
 There's so much. A lot less.
 It is way longer than you think and it's
 policy wise.
 It's at the consumer household
 level. I mean there are these limits and
 we hit them
 at various times in history and we've
 seen it what happens when you hit them
 and it's not pretty
 but it is amazing how extend and pretend
 can go
 on way long and a part of that and this
 is what I tend to warn people about who
 are so certain that everything's going to
 fall apart tomorrow
 is that
 the people who take that position and
 I'm wired to want to take that position
 you're up against the entire system.
 Everybody. Corporate America, the
 government, the households themselves,
 they want
 the status quo to continue
 so they will do an infinite number of
 unnatural acts
 to try to keep the status quo from going
 which is why it's so
 rough to be a short seller and why you
 and I generally don't recommend that
 people sell short is because you've got
 to get your timing right
 to make money there and you can again be
 totally right on this.
 There will come a period of time where
 it can like a drowning man. It'll just
 grab anything to just keep going for
 another cycle.
 No, it's true and this is why
 you're so much better off to be
 optimistic
 than pessimistic. First of all, you'll be
 happier in life
 in general. You'll be more successful in
 life being optimistic rather than
 pessimistic.
 But if you're optimistic, 80% of the time
 the market's going to be up.
 So you know your odds of winning on
 being optimistic are much greater than
 winning on being pessimistic.
 Understand the pessimistic side, right? I
 mean look you know you don't cross
 you you're optimistic that when you walk
 up to a road you're going to cross it
 because you're going to make it to the
 other side but you still look both ways
 right
 because that's the pessimistic hey I
 might get hit by a car so I'm going to
 check to see if a car is coming
 before I cross the street but you're
 optimistic you're going to make it
 across the street so in your portfolio
 always be optimistic.
 Always look forward with an optimistic
 view. Always invest with an optimistic
 view
 but just be aware that there are those
 things that could come along
 possibly that might take away some of
 your capital so you know it's so when
 you see the car coming you wait to cross
 the street right so
 you know you'll you'll win much more
 often than you lose with an optimistic
 view versus a pessimist.
 Yeah and I think history proves that out
 the math proves it out. I'm a big fan of
 hedging.
 Again you'll just be a happier person
 too. You'll be happy but also I'm a fan
 of hedging because it lets you
 it's insurance right it lets you
 basically say look
 if I'm if I'm going to be a little
 reluctantly optimistic you know I can
 sleep at night knowing that my hedges
 will hopefully kick in right and of
 course all the stuff you talk about with
 position sizing and the gardening and
 all that stuff.
 You set yourself up so that
 there's not just one
 nuclear event that can destroy you,
 right? That's right, yeah.
 Well look, I had a really
 good rant that I wanted us to get to.
 I don't think we're going to be able to
 get to it for time purposes given
 the other stuff I still want to get
 through because we didn't get through
 this one last time.
 This being again your article that
 basically
 sort of summarizes the wisdom of the
 current
 investing elders that we have
 right now. Most of these guys are all
 still alive.
 But I do want to go through a few of
 these with you and I don't know how much
 you remember this from
 just the top of your head here, Lance,
 but there are a couple of
 great points here I want to walk through
 and this is again maybe I'll start with
 the most important
 lesson here which was I think it was
 from Benjamin Graham.
 Here's a quote from his classic book, The
 Intelligent Investor.
 "The investor's chief problem and even
 his worst enemy
 is likely to be himself." Again, this
 comes back to
 really emotional decision-making. It's
 not, "Oh, you're your worst enemy because
 you're doing your math wrong,"
 right? It really comes to just
 making the wrong choice at the wrong
 time because those old emotions of feet
 or fear or greed
 are clouding your thinking. That's
 right.
 Again, it's just everything we've talked
 about today and
 let me be clear is that I'm not
 saying that bad things can't
 happen. They can
 and my point is though is that you
 can't focus on those
 because the market's going to go
 up more often than it goes down and so
 you've got to be in a position to
 to be with the market and as we said,
 why do investors constantly
 not make money in markets? Because they
 sell low and they buy high and again
 that's exactly what Ben Graham's talking
 about. The worst
 problem that investors have are
 themselves. It's all the emotional
 mistakes they make. It's all the bad
 decisions they make.
 It's all the timing decisions they make.
 It's getting wrapped up in these big
 macro narratives that
 you can't really invest for and hold
 long enough to actually for them to
 work out.
 That's the very short-term
 position of the portfolio.
 For most of these too, Lance,
 and by the way I'll let you give the
 promo,
 but folks can find this
 article on your website. Most of these
 sort of axioms from these folks are some
 variation of
 humans do a bad job of assessing risk
 and we end up
 paying for something that is way riskier
 than we realize or
 we buy something, it goes up and we
 assume that we're brilliant and then we
 ride that thing for way too long, like
 you said.
 A fast appreciating asset is in
 fact getting riskier
 as it appreciates because it's getting
 overbought or whatnot and so
 we tend to just oftentimes
 make the wrong decision, again not
 an investor, Adam's not an investor,
 all the people that Adam's interviews are
 not investors,
 you're not an investor as an individual,
 we're all speculators.
 Why? Because as people putting money
 into the market, we're all just
 betting on some outcome in the future. We
 have no control over it.
 Warren Buffett is an investor because
 when he invests into a company he has
 control of what that company does. He can
 call the board of directors and say, "Hey,
 I don't like you doing that."
 So they don't do it, they go in some
 other direction. He has that control,
 that's investing and his time horizon's
 100 years, so
 that's an investment where you control
 the outcome.
 But as us, we're just buying and selling
 ethereal pieces of paper
 that trade into a marketplace and we're
 just hoping that we're buying at one
 price and that someday we'll sell it at
 a higher price.
 That's the purest form of speculation,
 it's the same as sitting down with a
 hand of poker
 and hoping you're gonna win. You place
 your money out on the table,
 you hope your hand is better and you're
 a better player than everybody else at
 the table
 and you can win more money than you bet.
 That's all you're doing in the financial
 markets and all these rules,
 and maybe just put a link to the article
 in this video, Adam,
 is just going through and talking and
 every one of these, whether it's Jeff
 Gunlach,
 the trick is to take risk and be
 paid for taking those risks,
 but take a basket of risk in
 your portfolio on a diversified basis.
 Ray Dalio, the largest mistake that
 people make,
 is to believe what happens in the past
 will happen in the future.
 Seth Klarman, most investors are
 primarily oriented towards return and
 not the risk that they take.
 Every one of these,
 whether it's Jeremy
 Grantham, Jesse Livermore, etc.,
 this
 tenet of every great investor over time
 is to focus on the risk
 because the risk is not how much money
 you make, it's how much money you lose
 when you're wrong.
 This is one of the reasons why
 I'm such a big proponent of people. The
 average person working with a
 good professional financial advisor
 because
 humans are bad at risk assessment or at
 least they're bad at this type of
 risk assessment.
 We've talked about this a lot.
 We're really well wired for the
 visible immediate threat. Is the
 tiger
 snarling and about to pounce on me? Okay,
 great. Do I flee or do I fight it?
 We're really good for that type of risk.
 For much more ethereal esoteric stuff
 like this,
 we're very, very bad at it and so having
 somebody who is skilled
 in risk management and who can create
 the structure
 to work with you not only to do all the
 goal setting and stuff that we talked
 about last time, Lance,
 but just to say we are going to
 mathematically construct a portfolio
 here for you and then garden it, to use
 your words,
 in a way that we will be bringing the
 overall risk threshold down
 for you is tremendously helpful
 versus the average person who sees the
 headline,
 whatever gets emotionally
 invested or charged up by
 something that's going on and is making
 mostly a gut speculated decision like
 you were talking about.
 Without that discipline of
 risk assessment, which most people just
 haven't been trained to do,
 you really are speculating
 in the dark if we're being honest
 with ourselves.
 That's why we have to
 control what we don't know and
 it's that old saying about
 it's not what we know that is
 important. It's what we don't know that
 we don't know.
 Or what Trane would say,
 which I think is just as bad, is
 what we know for sure that just ain't so.
 I know this is what's going to
 happen next month.
 Exactly and then you make your bet on it
 and then that doesn't happen
 and now you're really on the
 wrong side of the coin. Again,
 this is just like October. In
 October,
 again, I was writing things like, "Hey, this
 market's really oversold. We're going to
 bounce
 at some point here," and I was getting
 just like, "No, this market's just
 going to go down. You're completely
 missing it," you know, blah, blah, blah.
 And now it's bounced and so
 if you were short the market going into
 the end of October, you're paying a price
 for it now.
 And that's just simply a function of
 making these
 bets on a certainty of outcome that we
 are not certain about at all.
 And this is why we have to
 always remember that we're speculating
 and as speculators, what we have
 to do is manage our bets.
 And you know, if you're playing, you know,
 a hand with a pair of twos, you're not
 going to bet all in. If you've got a full
 house,
 maybe you do go all in on your hand, but
 that's because you know that your odds
 of winning,
 you know, mentally are higher. I mean, even
 if you're a poor poker player,
 right, and you really don't understand
 all the odds of poker, you
 probably get the idea that if you have a
 pair of twos,
 you're probably not going to win the
 hand. So you're probably not going to
 bet a whole lot
 on that pot, right? But if you're holding
 four aces, you inherently know that's a
 pretty good hand. I mean, even a basic
 player gets that idea
 and you're probably going to be willing
 to bet a little bit more on that hand.
 Even though you may lose,
 you're probably going to bet some more
 just because you know you've got a
 really good hand, but you don't approach
 it the same way when you invest.
 You do exactly the opposite by making
 big bets on very poor hands.
 Yeah, all right. Well, just wrapping up
 on this,
 there's two main things I
 take from these quotes. One is the
 risk assessment part and then the other
 is the
 issues of emotion being in the
 driver's seat and you mentioned this
 earlier, but I think it's important to
 emphasize here. Howard Marks here
 says, I think I got two quotes from him I
 want to talk to,
 "To buy low,
 one must sell high."
 Buying low
 doesn't help you if you end up riding it
 up and then back to a lower price than
 you bought it at. So it's really
 knowing when to sell or knowing when to
 take chips off the table and I think
 that you said this earlier, that in many
 ways is when
 investors'
 sort of overconfidence begins to kick in.
 "Oh, I've got this winner. I'm sitting on
 these great gains.
 I don't want to sell my winner." And of
 course, you hear the story, "Ride your
 winners." That's sort of one of the
 prevailing things here.
 And so talk for a second about that
 because
 there is some logic there. If
 something's doing really well,
 yes, you want to lock in your game to
 actually have the game
 eventually,
 but
 there's an understandable sense of like,
 "Well, if this thing's really
 running, I don't want to hop off
 secretariat if he's only
 halfway around the track yet." So
 how do you help somebody begin to get
 out of a position
 that's done well?
 Well, no, that's the
 misnomer. It's that you don't have to get
 out of the position. Look, we've owned
 Apple forever,
 but we regularly buy and sell
 Apple.
 Not entirely, right? So, you know, this is
 Portfolio Risk Management 101, right? So
 if I'm going to buy a position, every
 position in our portfolio can have
 up to a maximum weighting of 5%.
 A lot of our positions are less than 5%
 because of risk in the markets. We don't
 like the risk in the markets. We don't
 like the overvaluation in certain
 indices. Certain stocks'
 valuations are too high.
 So when we say, "Okay, we
 want Apple to be 4% of the portfolio," or
 whatever it is,
 when it gets to be four and a half or
 five, it's had a big run,
 then we trim it back down to the
 portfolio weight. Or maybe we'll reduce
 it even further. Maybe we'll make it
 three percent of the portfolio. And then
 when it eventually has a correction,
 which it always does,
 we then take it back up to portfolio
 weight. And you just do that
 back and forth over time. When things get
 really overbought and extended, you take
 some profits. You know, you never went
 broke taking a profit.
 It gives you cash. And just because you
 sell something today,
 take profits, doesn't mean you have to
 invest it immediately, right?
 Let it sit there until you find another
 opportunity. This is a fascinating thing
 about the stock market, by the way, that
 it's always boggled me
 when I talk to individuals.
 And that is that they feel like they
 have to be all invested all the time.
 "I've always got my cash in doing
 something. So if I sell something, I'm
 going to buy something else immediately."
 But, you know, if you were going to buy
 anything else,
 you know, like you're going to buy a new
 television or you're going to buy a new
 car, you do hours of research. You go
 online, you compare models, you compare
 makes, you look at the prices. Which
 dealer has a better price? Which one's
 giving more incentives?
 All this other stuff to try to save, you
 know, a nickel or a dime here or there.
 And, you know, my wife's the best at this.
 She'll drive all the way across Houston
 for an hour and a half to save 25 cents
 on something.
 You know, she doesn't, you know, but
 that's girl math.
 You know, she saved money, you know.
 But, you know, when it comes to the stock
 market, you don't apply that same type of
 frugality.
 And you just, you know, because people
 have told you to do this is that you
 just buy whatever's going up.
 But just because you own something
 that's working doesn't mean you can't
 sell some of it.
 And it doesn't mean you can't sell all
 of it. Then this has always been another
 fascinating thing about individuals. They
 think if they sell something, they're now
 in this club
 that is excluded from ever buying that
 asset again. "Well, I sold Apple
 and I can't buy it back." That's not true.
 You can buy it and you can sell it and
 you can buy it right back.
 If you sell it at a wash, you got to
 wait 30 days for the wash sell rule.
 Then you can buy it back. That's tax
 loss selling, by the way.
 So, you know, there's there's nothing
 that there's no requirement
 to take profits. That means you have to
 sell everything.
 We rarely sell everything unless we're
 doing tax loss selling or we just don't
 like the position anymore. Generally,
 we're taking profits here.
 We're buying it back cheaper later. You
 know, those type of things. And so, you
 know, we have a lot of positions, our
 portfolio, Costco,
 AbbVie, Apple, Microsoft, Google, we've
 owned them for a very long time.
 We're never going to sell them unless
 something changes within the market that
 says those are no longer
 good trending assets to own over the
 long term. And so far that has happened
 doesn't mean that won't happen. And maybe
 at some point,
 you know, Apple's last earnings report
 was a good example of this.
 They're not growing revenue and there
 may be a case to be made in the next
 year or two if they can't figure out how
 to grow revenue that maybe we sell Apple
 entirely because they can't grow
 revenues anymore
 as opposed to Google, which is still
 growing at double digits in some areas.
 So those are the things that, you know,
 you want to think about. But this idea of,
 you know, having to own something all the
 time is not true.
 That if you sell it, you can't buy it
 back is not true.
 And you can't sell some. You have to sell
 all is also not true. So just
 focus on the position sizing
 and focus on the risk you're taking with
 that position and then manage it
 accordingly. It's not difficult.
 All right. Well said. And I'll just
 say for the average person watching who
 has a real life and a busy job and all
 that stuff,
 yes, do that. But you may be much
 better served by
 not trying to figure out how to apply
 that to individual securities and
 figuring out how to apply that to
 selecting the advisor who has that
 approach that you feel most comfortable
 with and let outsource that to them
 while you focus on the things in your
 life that you have to.
 All right. Well, look in wrapping up here,
 because I'm looking and seeing that
 we're quickly running out of time here,
 trades. What trades did you do this
 diminished week, if any?
 Not in this week, just because it's a
 holiday shortened week. So you
 don't ever trade the week of
 Thanksgiving because there's nobody
 around. So it's kind of the inmates
 running the asylum markets can move, you
 know, kind of willy nilly and doesn't
 make a lot of sense. We did some tax law
 selling the week before
 and we're looking for
 this pullback, which we think will come
 in the first two weeks of December.
 Could be as far as the 15th of December
 when the FOMC has their next meeting, but
 somewhere between now and Christmas
 we'll likely get a pullback and
 we'll put some of the cash we've raised
 to work.
 Okay. And give any planned trades
 between now and then or you literally
 sort of in a wait and see holding
 pattern right now? There's some
 positions that we own in our portfolio
 that probably we're just going to be
 adding to.
 Berkshire Hathaway, Walmart,
 probably Costco, I would imagine, and
 then we've got a couple of
 small cap positions that we like.
 Stanley Black and Decker,
 which is really starting to perform much
 better,
 and so there's going to be some
 areas that we just typically
 probably just take cash and increase
 those position sizes,
 but there may be a new
 position or two that we add depending on
 what kind of what's going on.
 Okay. All right. Well, there were some
 interesting things I wanted to discuss
 with you, but we're going to have to
 punt those to next week given that we
 run a bit long this week.
 Very quickly,
 folks, thank you for making it all the
 way through with us again for yet
 another week.
 Lance, very happy to be that these
 weekly market recaps are back up and
 running.
 We were getting tons and tons of
 requests for them
 over the past couple of weeks now that
 they've started been getting a lot of
 love for the fact that they're back, so
 thank you for rejoining,
 resaddling up with me on these. Folks, if
 you are enjoying these,
 would love for these to continue and
 maybe even for
 me to arrange that behavioral economist
 to come on and chat with Lance on one of
 these in the near future.

 Just a reminder too that I am
 publishing a lot of supplemental
 information to these videos through my
 new sub stack
 and
 that's also where when I do the
 interviews during the week,
 I'm now sharing my Adam's Notes. Those
 specifically are going to the premium
 subscribers who have been helping
 support this channel,
 but I'm giving lots of information about
 what we're working on here, what's next
 for Thoughtful Money,
 and I will share very quickly the roster
 of folks coming up
 next week. So the video after this one,
 which should come out tomorrow if you're
 watching this
 on Saturday, the day this releases, will
 be with Ted Oakley.
 Another great discussion with Ted. He
 never disappoints.
 I then have a conversation with Simon
 Hunt, which I just recorded.
 That one, folks, I gotta warn you, it's
 probably going to make you want to put
 your head in the oven. I do try to
 work with Simon to pull your head out
 before the end of that interview.
 It's deep. We'll put it that
 way. It's heavy.
 I then
 was at the New Orleans Investment
 Conference a couple of weeks ago and I
 moderated a panel on the future of money
 with Daniel DiMartino Booth, Lynn Alden,
 Jim Rickards, and Russ Gray.
 They are kindly letting me run that to
 you guys for free,
 so that'll be next Thursday, and then we
 have Michael Pento
 coming back on the program. A lot of
 folks have been asking for him, so we've
 got a great lineup lined ahead,
 so stay tuned for this coming week as I
 wrap up -- oh, sorry, and so to go get my
 follow me for free on that sub stack,
 just go to AdamTaggart.Substack.com.
 You'll get all the information there, and
 again, if you want to get the Adam's
 Notes, you can sign up for them there by
 upgrading to premium.
 All right, Lance, I'll let you have the
 last word as always, buddy.
 Nope, we'll see what happens next week,
 but I hope everybody had a happy
 Thanksgiving and enjoyed yourself.
 All right, great. Yeah, I forgot. I should
 have mentioned this at the very
 beginning. I can't tell if people can
 see this sort of puffy eye I have here,
 but I was roughhousing with one of my
 dogs last night and got a little more
 dog in my face than I was expecting.
 I think she was just amped up on all the
 turkey.
 Yeah, had a great time. I'm glad to hear
 you did too. Everybody else, I hope you
 all had phenomenal
 Thanksgivings, and if you've got
 the interest, that interview I mentioned
 with Jesse Felder, really interesting
 conversation. I'll put up a link to it
 right here. Lance, thanks so much, buddy.
 I'll see you next week. Everybody else,
 thanks so much for watching.
