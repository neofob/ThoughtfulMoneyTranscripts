Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm Thoughtful Money founder and your host, Adam Taggart, welcoming you back at the end
of another week, joined as usual by my Odyssean friend, portfolio manager, Lance Roberts.
Lance, how you doing?
I'm doing good today.
How are you?
Good.
So Odyssean was particularly fitting for you for two reasons.
One, as you shared last week, you are heading off to Greece this summer for your own tour
of the Mediterranean.
Hopefully, it's not quite as wandering and meandering as Odysseus's was.
But also Odysseus is the name of the lunar lander that just landed on the moon last night
and humans, Americans are back on the moon for the first time in 50 years.
One man spacecraft at this point, humans to follow hopefully next year.
It's one of those things that really gives me hope for our species.
I mean, it only took us like my entire lifetime for us to get back to the moon.
So I think a lot of people share my frustration and I don't know why it took so long after
all the momentum that we built up in the late 60s and early 70s.
But we're back and that opens a lot of potential for the human species experiment going forward
from here.
But anyways, I thought Odysseus was very fitting for you.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing, actually, though, because you figure all the computing power
we have today, all the technology, artificial intelligence that we put a man on the moon.
That's pretty incredible.
Just to remember, though, that we were putting men on the moon back in the 50s and 60s with
slide rules, so computing power of an HP calculator.
So I think like a coffee maker at this point.
It's pretty amazing and it's been this 50-year gap and we've had to relearn, basically, we
had to relearn everything to put man back on the moon that we had developed previous
because a lot of those scientists and engineers, they died.
And remember, we haven't put men back on the moon yet or people back on the moon yet.
That's still coming.
Hopefully we will.
Exactly.
No, of course, this has fed all the conspiracy theorists into overdrive that, "Oh, yeah,
now we can put a man on the moon."
But we didn't actually do it 50 years ago.
It was Hollywood doing it behind the scenes.
Well, I'm curious.
Are they believing that it's not a soundstage now?
Don't know yet.
Not sure.
We'll see what TikTok says in a few days.
Okay.
All right.
Well, look, in the spirit of momentous developments, I don't think I can ask you about the week
without starting with Nvidia.
Sure.
So Nvidia had their earnings, and the world was beginning to kind of bite its nails saying,
"Oh, is this the time when the giant's going to show some weakness?"
And it didn't.
And we had the biggest market cap gain in history or something like that.
So tell us what's going on.
Second largest market cap gain for a stock in a single day next to Meta, which happened
26 days ago when they announced earnings.
So it's just a lot of excitement behind the markets and a lot of speculative positioning.
We had the options going crazy on Nvidia before the actual earnings announcement.
So we actually took some profits just before the earnings announcement, both Nvidia and
AMD, just simply because there was so much speculation they were going to crush earnings,
which they did, that even just some weak guidance would have probably led to a Palo Alto type
downturn where the stock was down 26% in a day.
So it was a little bit of prudent profit taking prior to the announcement, but, again, great.
After the announcement, stock was up sharply, up 15% yesterday, AMD was right along with
that.
I think it was up 11% or 12% yesterday.
We bought some Palo Alto on the downturn when it was down 25%, 26%.
It was up yesterday in conjunction with the whole AI trade.
So again, there's absolutely nothing wrong with this market right now.
So no need to be fearful of it.
Well, OK, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, because I'm going to ask you about
a couple of things, but maybe I'll jump to this one, which is one of the two of us just
put out a video called a magnificent bubble.
So when you say nothing to worry about here, what exactly do you mean, because I think
you do have some concerns.
Right now, the short term trend is very positive.
We came down, we tested the 20-day moving average.
Here, let's look at our chart for the week, but yeah, you can take a look at this market
and ever since really the October lows of this time last year, that the market's just
traded right along the 20-day moving average, and every time we've come down and tested
that 20-day moving average, that's been key support for the market.
The market moves higher, we break out to a new high.
It's exactly what happened on Thursday is that we came down on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
tested that 20-day moving average, bounced off of it on Thursday and then on Friday opened
up a little bit higher.
Now markets are selling off a little bit early on Friday, but that's not surprising.
After such a big gain, the markets were up almost 2% and 3% on the NASDAQ, so a little
bit of a give back on that big rush into the market yesterday, not surprising, but again,
just from a short-term trend perspective, there's absolutely nothing to be fearful of
about the market and again, the only key indicator just to pay attention to is if this market's
going to give us a bigger correction, it'll be a break below the 20-day moving average
and then we'll probably be talking about testing the 50 and potentially retracing back to the
200.
At some point this year, a retest of the 200-day moving average is not going to be surprising
at all, but just not in the next few days.
Okay.
So, yeah, so that's what I wanted to ask you about this, which is how as a capital manager
are you riding this right now and are you making any material changes to your portfolio
based upon what just happens?
Sounds like not.
It sounds like you took a little bit off the table right before just in case there was
a disappointment.
There wasn't.
You still obviously have long positions in Nvidia and some of these other related stocks.
I guess you're just going to say you're going to keep riding while the momentum continues
going and then if the momentum starts to slow, then you'll reevaluate.
Right.
And again, since we added Nvidia, I mean, Nvidia is up almost 30% or 40% since the beginning
of the year, I mean, so, you know, we had a position in the portfolio that had grown
outside of its target weighting and so all we did was trim it back to target weight.
Same thing for AMD.
AMD's had a huge run this year.
It's up 50, 60% since the beginning of the year as well, but we trimmed that back to
its regular weighting and that's just how we manage risk is that when things get out
of balance or out of tolerance relative to the target weightings, we just trim it back
to the target weight, take a little bit of money off the table and then at some point
Nvidia will give us a nice, you know, either a pullback or consolidation and because we've
owned Nvidia in the past, right.
We owned Nvidia back at the October 2022 lows, it went up 100%.
We sold it, waited for correction, came back and bought it again and so, you know, those
are the, you know, that's just how we manage the risk in the portfolio, but, you know,
we realize at some point we're going to get a broader downturn, but and then at that point
we'll reduce overall equity risk, but right now momentum indicators are fine.
The trend is positive.
There's certainly some concerns out there technically.
I mean, we have, you know, a bit of negative divergence between momentum indicators in
the markets.
We have a bit of negative divergence between the stocks above their, you know, the breadth
of the market relative to the S and P. So there's certainly some concerns out there.
We're watching those very closely, but from a market perspective and from a portfolio
positioning perspective, you know, trying to short this market is just a terrible bet
right now.
All right.
So I want to kind of keep pulling at this thread to try to differentiate sort of Lance,
the technical trader, you know, versus Lance, the portfolio strategy guy, right?
And so there's, there's, there's not, I'm not a technical trader, so we use technicals
in our portfolio management, but we don't trade.
So I mean, I'm not buying a stock today and selling it tomorrow.
Okay.
Yeah.
I didn't mean that.
I meant more sort of like trading the market as it is versus, you know, what your, your
logic and scope of history says maybe to watch out for and kind of what I'm, what I'm talking
about here.
Let me see if I can share my screen here real quickly.
I'm going to, I'm going to counter your chart here with, with a highly technical meme.
So you probably saw this when it, when it was going around Lance the elephant here on
the beach ball.
Yep.
You able to see this?
Yeah.
So you've seen this, right?
This is sort of a visualization of, of, of the, you know, thinking here that the whole
market is, is basically being held up now at one point by, but practically one stock,
right?
We've talked about how the breath has gotten so narrow.
And of course that stock is really being pushed higher by the whole euphoria around AI and
how it's going to transform everything.
So, you know, in the video here, we get these little ants that are holding up the beach
ball that are then holding up the entire elephant, right?
And I, I do want to give you a chance to give any commentary about the video that you put
out there called a magnificent bubble.
Like I presume that you still have concerns of like a super concentrated market.
Maybe you're hearing echoes of past euphoric eras in the market, whether it was the.com
era, whether it was the nifty 50, but you've got to make money in the environment that
is not the environment you think should be.
So that's what I'm trying to parse here or help people understand how you think about
both.
Yeah, no, no.
I mean, you know, there's certainly worries and if we take a look at, at long-term trends
of the markets, et cetera, you know, there's certainly always a correlation between ultimately
valuations and forward returns and those types of things.
And you go back to the, to the, to the late, really the mid seventies, you know, 74, 75,
you had a big bear market.
Well, prior to that was the nifty 50 and the nifty 50 were the, basically the 50 largest
blue chip stocks.
It was Polaroid and Procter and Gamble and Xerox.
And these were the leaders of, of kind of the new era at that point, that was the nifty
50 bubble at that time.
And that can last quite a long time.
Now, eventually the market's corrected because the expectations of what was going on and
what was actually happening obviously diverged and so prices had to catch down with reality.
Of course, there was a lot of things going on, the oil embargo, inflation, those type
of things, but it was eventually the realization of, you know, what companies could actually
earn versus what they were earning that, that became problematic.
And we saw the same thing in the dot-com bubble in 98, 99, actually starting in 95, you know,
for five years, the market just ran up kind of nonstop into 2000 and what eventually got
the market was Enron.
And Enron was the thread that kind of pulled the veil back and we started going, Hey, well,
if Enron's earnings aren't real, what about WorldCom and Lucent and, you know, Global
Crossing and all these other dot-com companies, just how good are those earnings?
And all of a sudden we had to reprice that fantasy that we had created for all these
stocks that they were never going to grow into the revenue.
The difference this time is that Nvidia is making the revenue.
They had, they announced more revenue in one quarter than they did for an entire year last
year.
So, you know, they're growing revenue leaps and bounds.
You take a look at Meta's earnings, they're growing revenue sharply.
And so a big difference between what's happening now and what happened in the dot-com bubble
and what happened back in the 50/50 was that the revenue growth is actually very strong
here.
And having said that, it doesn't mean there's not a mismatch between what's going on with
revenue and what we're paying for it.
So again, you know, Nvidia announced great revenue, great sales, but their price to sales
ratio basically remained unchanged because they ran up the price of the stock to compensate
for the increase in sales.
So there's still a mismatch between the sales growth of these companies and what investors
are paying for them.
And that'll eventually come home to roost at some point, at some point in the future,
Nvidia is going to go, "Hey, we only grew revenue this month at 100% versus 40%."
Because that's just the law.
Well, that's just the law of large numbers.
I mean, you know, unless you're going to own the entire AI market, which will never be
the case, you know, there's going to be a slowdown in revenue growth and at some point
price and valuation will have to meet, but that could be dramatically higher from here
before that happens.
Well, and let me ask you about this.
I need to bring on an AI expert and really crawl into their heads, but kind of two questions
for you, one on the AI market in general, it seems that the market just keeps expanding
its estimate of what the size of the value unlock that AI is going to bring.
Nobody knows.
And at this point, you know, I mean, Nvidia, what did it gain more market value than like
Coca-Cola yesterday or something like that?
Like it's just massive.
I hear all these comparisons.
I can't remember anymore at the top of my head, but it's like, oh yeah, it's worth more
than all the energy companies in the world and it's just crazy things like that, right?
So one is, you know, are we kind of getting ahead of our skis in terms of how transformative
we think AI is going to be, especially because, you know, again, I don't follow the industry
enough to say that I'm really that informed on it, but criticism I have is somewhat similar
to sort of what I hear about Bitcoin, where you say like, well, you can't buy much with
it, you know, in the real world.
Like a lot of people are like, I'm not seeing AI really making my life better in that many
ways right now, right?
So is it really going to unlock as much value as people think?
And then secondly, and you've mentioned this a couple of times, which is, you know, Nvidia
is sort of the big dog right now, but will they always be like, I mean, competitors aren't
just going to sit on their hands and will, you know, their margins start getting competed
away as more and more people go after this cold rush?
Well, yeah, absolutely.
So let's take the second question first, because yes, success breeds competition.
And so there's going to be other players that look, there are already other players in the
market.
AMD is a good example.
There'll be other players that come to market, you know, this CHIPS Act is very interesting
because, you know, we passed this CHIPS Act.
Well, right now, all you have to do to get money from CHIPS Act is basically supply a
PowerPoint to the government says you're going to build chips and they'll send you money.
And so we have a lot of companies getting formed right now that generate no revenue
whatsoever, but they're using government money to do that.
You know, but there's going to be other competitors that come into the market, either domestically
or foreign, to compete in space because, again, somebody is going to look this is all in.
You know, if you look at Nvidia, you look at AMD and these other companies and Apple's
such a great example of this.
Apple doesn't create product, so to speak.
You know, you take a look at Samsung as an example, they're about five years ahead of
whatever Apple's producing.
Apple produces pretty much what everybody else produces.
They just do a better job at it.
They build a better mousetrap, they have better designers.
But their technology is no better than anybody else, but they've built this very loyal fan
base because they build a little bit better product.
And so there's going to be another competitor that comes along and says, hey, Nvidia builds
a great product, but I'm going to build one that's a little bit, just a smidge better.
I'm going to charge less for it and that's going to eat into market share.
So and again, because at some point and again, most of these GPUs are going into cloud storage
and a lot of the data centers.
That's a very low moat to entry to build a data center.
All I got to do is go rent a warehouse, throw on some computers, throw some chips in, some
GPUs and I can have a data center.
So there's a very weak moat to or that barrier to entry that exists in this technology.
So there's going to be for people that don't have billions of dollars like Amazon or Apple
or Microsoft to spend on Nvidia chips to build data centers, there's going to be smaller
companies that are willing to use a slightly inferior chip that costs less money to build
their data centers.
Right.
Because that's a revenue.
That's something they can create revenue on.
And the more that we continue to do stuff on the Internet and, you know, TikTok and social
media and, you know, door dashing and whatever else that we can figure out to put on an app,
you're going to need more and more data centers.
So this is just video games.
You know, video games are a huge data center issue.
So, you know, the more that we move in that direction, the more demand that's going to
be.
But again, again, the efficiency will increase, costs will come down, profitability will decline
eventually.
But again, we're very, very early in all of this.
And to your point now to the first question is that nobody knows what the size of this
thing is because we've never done this before, but we've done the Internet before.
And if you go back to the dotcom era, if you were alive back then, like I was, you know,
the Internet was going to, you know, make everything better and it was going to replace
everything.
And don't worry about job loss, because if you lose your job in engineering, that's OK.
You just go learn how to program a Web site, because at that time, if you were graduating
college in 1998, 1999, you were getting a job as a Web programmer for three hundred
thousand dollars a year.
You were getting a BMW.
Things were giving you a house to live in the whole nine yards because there was such
a demand for those Web based programmers.
Now, those are not high paying jobs anymore because everybody can do it.
And now I can do it.
So you know that.
So when we go through these innovations, they sound great.
It's like, oh, this is going to change everything.
It's OK if you lose your job, you know, go get a job in A.I. because that's going to
be it.
But again, there's only a finite number of jobs that are going to be available because
of that, and that technology will only displace more jobs than it creates.
And that's what we've been seeing with the employment since 2000.
We've seen that the full time employment relative to the population continually decline ever
since the peak of the dot com bubble.
Wages have declined, standard of livings have declined.
Nothing's gotten better because of the Internet.
It's gotten more convenient.
But in terms of economic prosperity, it's not gotten better unless you're in the top
10 percent of the of the economy.
All right.
So where it's kind of going on this is, you know, let's let's use the dot com as an example.
I mean, the Internet did revolutionize the kind of things, right?
And you had companies like Amazon, you know, that proved to be fantastic long term winners.
But like many other companies, you know, their price got sent to the moon and then took a
massive correction as we entered into the dot com bus and took many years to get back
on track.
And now it's doing great.
Right.
Nvidia may be that type of company.
It might be the big dog still in this space 20 years from now.
My point is, are we seeing sort of history repeat itself here?
Well, don't forget, Nvidia lost more than half its value in 2022.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A huge correction.
Stock was one hundred dollars a share in November of 2022.
It's now six hundred and fifty, six hundred eighty, whatever closed that yesterday.
So I mean, you know, it's had that big correction because because prior to that correction,
remember in prior to that correction, we were talking about stocks in 2019.
They were at ridiculous highs.
We're talking about a melt up in the market going into 2020.
And, you know, technology was leading the way and you know, everybody everybody was
uber bullish.
And then we had the pandemic.
So, you know, we've never corrected that bullish trend and we've never resolved these long
term extensions from the exponential, you know, growth trend line of the markets.
But we keep having these corrections along the way that kind of give people fuel to start
buying these stocks again.
So I agree and looking here at Nvidia, which actually is trading up near eight hundred
now.
It went from three hundred to your point down to below one fifty right now, one twenty five
or so.
Right.
So that was a very big correction.
But at this point, you can make it pretty sure that it's really gotten ahead of itself
here.
Can you pull up a chart on that of, say, Amazon going back to nineteen ninety five ish?
Sure.
Can I give you a can you get a long term chart?
I think I can.
Yeah.
I can be able to see it on this chart because of the splits, but we'll see.
See what we can find.
So you can't really see it.
But Amazon lost like 80 percent of its value during the dot com crash.
Apple did the same thing.
Try Apple.
Maybe the problem is the scale of the chart and stock splits and all that, which really
is is muted declines.
But you know, you kind of go back to that time frame.
You know, these stocks lost tremendous value during the dot com bust.
And people thought they were dead.
There you go.
Yeah, I'm a swing twenty three still.
Yeah.
And I was kind of hoping I could find an easy way to find a date range here.
Oh, date range.
All right.
Keep talking and I'll pull this up.
But yeah.
So back in that period, a lot of these stocks, you know, basically got decimated.
And it took 20 years for him to get back to even a good example.
You know, Cisco Systems peaked out in nineteen ninety nine.
It still hasn't recovered back to its all time highs yet.
So you know, these things can can get absolutely decimated and then take over.
There you go.
Now you can see a little bit better.
But yeah, that's Amazon.
So you lost almost all of its value.
And then it took a very, very long time for it to recoup all that.
And then and ultimately that's what's going to happen with Nvidia.
No doubt about it.
At some point, there's going to be, you know, when the stock's trading at thirty five times
price to sales where it is currently, it's going to have a big correction.
You know, you know, three hundred to one twenty five.
You know, there's your there's your correction.
So eight hundred to two hundred.
That's going to be your next correction at some point.
And people are going to start talking about, oh, FAANG stocks are dead.
It's all over.
There's nobody.
Everybody hates AI.
And then the stock will recover again at some point.
Yeah.
I do want to make the point that raised the question that let's say eight hundred to two
hundred happens, right?
I think that may have a much bigger effect on the markets this time round than three
hundred to one twenty five for Nvidia two years ago.
Just because Nvidia is so much more market now than it was back then.
Right.
We're in the magnificent four now, right?
Yeah.
Well, no, it is.
But it's also the function that like, for instance, you know, yesterday was it was a
very interesting day in the market because.
Well, when when the market was going up and this is all about Nvidia yesterday, right.
So Nvidia's screaming off to the moon and, you know, you let me pull up a heat map from
yesterday real quick and share my screen.
So yeah, here's just here's a picture of the heat map from yesterday.
And you know what?
So you see Nvidia it's up.
You know, when I took when I took this snapshot, it wasn't quite it was a little bit before
the close.
But Nvidia is up 14 percent at this point, Broadcom's up six, AMD's up eleven.
You know, but what is Nvidia's earnings have to do with Eli Lilly, which which was up three
and a half percent yesterday, or Visa, which was up over two percent yesterday.
And so, you know, what's happening with the markets now is that it's like, oh, Nvidia
is up.
Let's buy everything.
People are piling in to, you know, stocks that are in the top 10 stocks.
You're buying MGK as an example, which is, you know, kind of focused on those big mega
cap weighted companies.
So when I start piling money into MGK to participate with the Nvidia trade, it fuels all these
other companies.
And so Microsoft and Metta and Amazon and Lilly, you know, they all get a hit from that
from that impact.
But that's the impact of that passive investing that we've talked about before.
But that's kind of the insanity that's going on with the markets right now.
And so, yes, to your point, at some point, if in the next few quarters of the next couple
of years, Nvidia misses earnings or for some reason, there's a new competitor shows up,
takes business away from them, whatever it is that ultimately causes a shift in either
outlook or a shift in the actual revenue growth of the business.
It'll take the whole it'll take this whole market with it, assuming that this market
hardy hasn't come to that decision beforehand and figured out that, you know, the market
is more important than just one stop.
Okay, I'm going to ask you one more question about, you know, market nervousness, and then
we'll move on here.
So because the vibe, the strong vibe I'm getting from you is, hey, you know what, like, you
can make money in this market, the bulls are running, you know, let's let's make money
where the bulls are running.
You recently, I think, actually, just this morning, just published a piece saying, hey,
you know, small cap stocks are looking pretty risky here, according to conference board
data.
So elaborate on that.
So it sounds like you're not too worried about the big dogs right now.
But there's a, yeah, there's a massive difference.
And so one of the things that really kind of caught my eye this this past week, and
let me see if I can just find a quick chart on it.
And as you're answering, let me put this question on the table for you to answer as well, which
is, why care about small cap stocks, right?
Like if the big guys who drive the indices are running, so what about those guys, right?
Let's just all be in the big guys, and everything's gonna be fine.
Yeah, well, again, we're mostly invested in large caps and but you know, small caps, though,
are very economically sensitive.
And this is actually, the article that's out on the website on Friday, and here, let me
just pull it up here real quick, because there's a couple of charts we'll go through.
This is actually part one of a part two article.
They cover the small caps in a couple of different positions.
But you know, the important thing is, is that small caps are very economically sensitive.
And that's the first part of this article is really talking about that economic sensitivity.
Because small caps don't have the ability to do things like massive corporate stock
buybacks.
They don't have the capital for it.
And a lot of these cases, and a good friend of ours over at Kailash Concepts just recently
sent me a chart for part two of this article, showing that for nearly 40% of the Russell
2000 index has negative earnings growth.
So when you're buying these, there's a huge difference between buying Nvidia as an example,
is that they just generated $22 billion in a quarter, right, in revenue.
And you take a look at one of the other stocks that are going off to the moon lately, and
this is the latest meme stock, which is Super Micro Computer Inc, because it said it had
something to do with AI.
So all the meme traders jumped into it.
This stock went from $300 to almost $1,100 in less than a month.
And of course, it sold off here a bit recently because they announced earnings that weren't
nearly as good.
This stock went from $1,100 to $700, tried to bounce back up a bit, classic kind of topping
process for the stock.
But if we take this as Nvidia, right, that just generated $22 billion and a quarter,
you know, this company trades at, you know, just massive multiples.
It is growing earnings, but it's not growing earnings nearly fast enough to justify an
$1,100 price share.
And so the, you know, and for a lot of these companies, they have negative earnings growth
on top of this.
So, you know, if you take a look at economic cycles, which is, you know, really this whole
theme behind the small cap stocks is that in an early economic recovery, as the economy
is really getting traction, small caps tend to do fairly well at market peak and near
economic peaks where you're expecting slower rates of economic growth.
That's where large cap momentum, those type of things are doing well because those are
the ones that can generate the most earnings or are generating the most earnings revenue
growth kind of near that peak economic cycle.
So what are we talking about over the next year or two?
We're talking about higher Fed interest rates eventually and that lag effect on the economy
that slows down the economy at slower rates of earnings growth.
And the companies most impacted by that are the companies that, you know, trade, you know,
in that smaller cap space.
And they're the ones that have the most directly impact that have the biggest impact of spending
by consumers for their products.
And you know, over the last, and again, you know, just recently we're seeing a lot of
investors pile into small and mid caps are speculating that, oh, this is going to be
the catch up trade.
Small caps are going to catch up rapidly to the large caps now because large caps are
getting too far ahead of themselves.
But that's been a bad trade ever since 2014.
Large caps have outperformed small, mid and the Russell 2000 consecutively over that entire
time frame.
So this whole idea that, you know, it's going to be this ultimate catch up is fine.
And we have gotten and we have seen performance pick up in small and mid caps and we own a
few in our portfolio.
But the long term ability to outperform large caps isn't there because they can't do stock
buybacks, which since 2014, really going back to 2011, stock buybacks have accounted for
about 40 percent of the price increase in the S&P 500.
That's why the S&P 500 is outperforming small and mid caps that can't contribute that much
to doing it.
But this goes to a bigger concern, which is the National Federation of Independent Business
and something that, you know, we've talked to you and I have talked about before.
Small businesses make up about 50 percent of the employment in the US.
So when you talk about the BLS survey, they're basically interviewing a handful of companies
to get some of their employment data from it and they're interviewing large companies.
So that really kind of skews the BLS employment results from what's actually happening on
the ground.
The vast majority of businesses have fewer than 10 employees.
So that's your, you know, your barbershops, your salons, your nail salons, your, you know,
your small mom and pop retail stores, etc.
That's a big bulk of the economy that generates employment.
And so the National Federation of Independent Business surveys those businesses and says,
well, how are you feeling about things?
Well, they're not very optimistic.
Their optimism level is at recessionary levels.
And not only that, we're seeing a vast difference.
We talk about record retail sales that are coming out as like, oh, man, retail sales
are booming.
The actual real retail sales of what's happening with sales for small and mid-sized businesses
is not good.
And the percentage reporting higher sales is very low.
The percentage expecting higher sales next three months is very low and well below the
long-term median of what these businesses do.
Now, remember, sales is what drives optimism for the business.
If I'm making a lot of sales, then I'm going to invest in my business.
But you don't see that capex plans versus real gross domestic private investment is
declining.
Now, if we were in a strongly booming economy, that would be increasing, not declining.
And particularly for small businesses that would be benefiting from a stronger economy,
they'd be investing more in their business, building out a second shop, whatever it is.
And we've heard a lot of stories about, oh, well, there's all these job openings out there.
And look, small businesses are always optimistic, I've told you before that if you're going
to be in business, you can't be a pessimist, right?
You've got to be an optimist.
But there's a huge disconnect between when they interview these small companies, they
say, hey, you plan on hiring anybody?
Well, if the economy is as good as I'm hearing about, yeah, I'm going to hire some people.
OK, over the next three months, you're going to hire some more people.
Awesome.
How many did you hire last three months?
So if I ask you this three months ago and you said you were going to hire more people,
did you?
And that answer is no.
So there's this big gap between the number of what firms are saying that they're going
to hire versus what they actually do.
And the number they were saying they were going to hire is declining.
So none of that translates into a stronger economic environment for small caps.
And we take a look at sales expectations versus the annual change in earnings.
That suggests that earnings growth this year may turn out to be substantially weaker than
what companies are, what Wall Street analysts are expecting.
And there's a very long historical correlation between the NFIB year over year change in
the NFIB index versus small caps.
And you can see that big run we've had lately in small caps.
It aligned with the very small increase that we saw in NFIB confidence.
But if NFIB confidence starts to retard later this year because economic growth slows down,
concerns about sales continues, et cetera, you're going to see small caps come back under
pressure because that's who those businesses are.
So let me, I got two questions here and I'm probably going to be guilty of munging them
together again here, but I'll mention them both and you can answer any way you like.
We'll segregate them.
Yeah.
Well, so first off, there's just sort of a sense of like, we had the emergence of the
term too big to fail in the banking system come out in 2008.
Like, hey, the big guys who have a lot of advantages, when they get into trouble, we
got to help them out.
And that really enraged a lot of people, understandably.
Then we had the pandemic shut down and it was sort of like, hey, we can't go out and
frequent businesses, but we got to allow these big guys to continue operating.
So we really decimated a lot of small and medium sized businesses, put them at an extreme
disadvantage, put the big guys at an even greater advantage.
And in this type of market, with these type of financial conditions, the big guys, again,
have the advantage.
They've got the ability to do this buybacks and things like that.
So understandably, I think investors are basically saying, why deal with those small cap companies?
Let's just deal with the big guys.
So there seems to be this inherent unfairness and maybe sort of a deterioration of balance
and do we want to have an economy that is increasingly concentrating to just a few really
big behemoths?
I could make the argument, no, we don't want that.
So maybe I'll pause and let you respond to that for a second.
No, I agree with you.
Again, small and mid-sized businesses are the backbone of the economy.
And look, I have a huge problem with Amazon, personally, just not, I mean, I don't have
my personal animosity towards Amazon, but I'm just saying personally, there's a problem
that Amazon keeps kind of just overtaking more and more areas of the market.
And from a capitalism side of it is like, OK, well, that's capitalism at work.
I mean, this company has been very successful.
They see an opportunity in a business area, et cetera.
But the problem is their footprint is now so large that they're displacing any possibility
for a competitor to come into that space.
And so that's why we have monopoly laws in place.
And there's certainly you could probably make a case for monopolistic claim against Amazon.
But at the same time, Amazon provides a lot of ability for, for instance, you, you could
go write a book and then drop ship it on Amazon.
So Amazon provides you an ability to basically start your own small businesses of publishing
books on thoughtful money.
Here's my series of books on how to invest better or whatever.
And you can self-publish those and bypass the publishers and put those on Amazon.
And so that's where I'm kind of torn in that some there is definitely a case to be made
that companies like Microsoft and Google and Facebook and others have certainly displaced
opportunities for small and midsize businesses to exist, but at the same time, they've also
created a lot of business opportunities.
I can create a business and advertise on Facebook or I can create a business and advertise on
Google or set up a YouTube channel and make money from my YouTube channel.
Those are all things that you can do to benefit from these very large behemoth companies.
So it's, you know, it's a very tough question to answer because you can make cases on both
sides of this.
Yes.
They're monopoly bad for the economy.
We should break them up, give people more advantage to start a competitive business.
You know, I can start another online bookseller, you know, or you look at it from the standpoint
of like, Hey, they create lots of opportunities for people to start a small business if they
want to.
I mean, you know, every time I open my social media, I'm flooded by, you know, a stream
of videos of people telling me how to digitally market.
I can make thousands of dollars a month digitally marketing, you know, that's what, but you
know, that's part of this new society that us old people haven't quite gravitated to
yet.
Yeah.
Well, you know, I think, I think you used this term earlier to me, it's sort of a siren
song, a siren song of convenience, continuing our Odysseus analogy maybe.
But you know, personally, and it's funny, you use the example of, of me writing and
drop shipping a book on Amazon.
I actually did that about 12 years ago, this book is, yeah, it's great.
But it, it, you know, hollows out the diversity of our, of our commercial base.
And it's hard to prove the contra positive, which is, Hey, if we had more competition,
maybe we'd have even better services.
Right.
And of course, the danger of ending up with one or two global corps that run everything
is that once they have dominant position, well, then they slow down their innovation,
they crapify all their products, and there's nothing you can do about it, because there's,
there's no competition left anymore.
That's a rant for a different day.
Here's the question.
Just, just, just real quick for you to leave that point, just for anybody, just go watch
the movie Idiocracy to see who actually wins the takeover game.
It's funny, I actually was thinking of that as you were talking, I was like, I don't want
to beat the Idiocracy horse again, but all right, dude, you took another swipe at it.
That movie is sadly so prophetic on so many levels.
It's scary that, that, that one and Wally.
So watch Wally and Idiocracy on your weekend and you will know exactly where the world's
headed.
Yeah.
Well, you'll probably go jump off a cliff after you do that.
All right.
So my, my other question is, is as much advantage as the, the large cap companies have right
now could, and I'm going to continue our, our mythological references here could, could
the plight of the small companies actually be the Achilles heel that takes down the larger
companies.
And what I mean by that is, is you talked about, you know, I think a majority of jobs
are provided by the small to big cap companies.
And as those companies start struggling, if, if, if they have to start really cutting costs
seriously and start laying off workers, and you talked about how they're not hiring nearly
as much as they'd been guiding, right?
Could that begin kind of the negative spiral of a recession that then drops consumer demand
enough, then that begins to pull down the profits of the larger companies.
So could that actually, while everyone's sort of dismissing that space, could that actually
be the trigger that brings down the big guys?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, no doubt.
Look, look, you know, recessions always start at the bottom and go up, right?
It's just, we don't see it.
We don't see the erosion at the bottom until it reaches the top.
And ultimately, when we start talking about, oh, it's a recession, well, that's when Apple
just announced, you know, I'm not, Apple didn't do this by the way, but, you know, when we
reached the recession point, that's where Apple just announced 50,000 people they're
laying off and Google's announcing mass layoffs and, you know, Facebook's announcing mass
layoffs.
You know, but that's been happening, you know, long before in the smaller and midsize businesses,
they were already laying off people, you know, the big risk, and this is part two of the
article on Monday, is that there's this massive debt wall that's coming up for these businesses.
And there's already in the first quarter of this year, a massive jump in single B issuance
bonds that are being put out there.
And these small and midsize companies that have all this debt on their books, and these
are what we call zombie companies that, you know, they require debt issuance in order
to stay in business, they're resorting to triple B rated bonds, you know, leverage bonds,
leverage loans, et cetera, where they can try to get a little bit lower rate and get
out into the market.
So because, again, you're not paid for buying junk bonds in this market.
You know, there's, you know, I hear a lot of people running around like, oh, I'm buying,
you know, boy, if you buy you some triple B, you know, some double B rated or single
B rated bonds, you get 15%.
Yeah, that's awesome.
There's also a very high probability that you're going to get defaulted on your wind
up with nothing.
And you know, that's that's when you have to understand what you're buying into when
you start talking about these risk and about 40% of these companies in the Russell 2000
have negative earnings, they can't support the debt payments that are coming up.
And so if those bonds reset to much higher levels in 24, 25, 26, there's a real risk
of a surge in bankruptcies in that Russell 2000 space, that's your small mid cap companies,
that's going to cause that erosion that leads to that recession that, you know, now, interestingly
enough, my article for this weekend in our newsletter, about the board, the conference
board, who is the company that produces the leading economic index this week gave up the
recession call, they go through in the towel, they said, Well, you know, we've had this
recession call out for 23 months, and no recession, so we're gonna give it up now the only stretch
longer for 23 negative months in a row was 24 months during the financial crisis.
And the lei index went negative in April of 2007.
The recession wasn't called until December of 2008.
So we're still within that window for the National Bureau of Economic Research over
the next 12 months to come back and say, Oh, yeah, there was a recession, and it started
a year ago, but we won't know that for a while.
And to be clear, as I understood it, they said, Look, our indicators are still where
they usually are in recessions.
It just hasn't arrived.
So we're just taking the recession warning off.
But like, it's not like our indicators have dramatically gotten better.
Yeah, the only thing that's improved, of course, was their leading credit index and because
yields have come down.
And the S&P 500, which are two components of the 10 indicators are yield spreads, basically
yield spreads to get lack of a better term, and the S&P 500.
So the surge in the S&P 500 since October 2022 is really those are the only two things
you look at wages, everything else.
It's very negative and not really improving that much.
Yeah, well, so it sounds like, you know, you share my concerns about the lag effects.
And one big reason why I'm so worried about the lag effect is the maturity wall, right?
And we've been talking about it forever, and I'm sure you've been talking about it forever.
And the market clearly has given up on it, right?
Not worried about it.
They're not going to happen this time round, right?
Now, you know, I'm not ready to throw in the towel to say that the lag effect isn't going
to arrive and it's not going to matter.
I will say it has taken a little longer to arrive than I thought it would.
And we've talked a lot about the reasons why and a lot of that's been positive net liquidity
in the system and a lot of the extraordinary measures that are being taken.
And I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I kind of get the sense from you, Lance,
that you think, yeah, it probably could happen, but it's probably I don't get the sense you
think it's too much of a 2024 worry.
Yeah.
And well, that's the whole kind of really the conversation in this weekend's newsletter,
which is that the inherent risk of a recession are still very present.
But because we have to reverse GDP from 12% to zero, it's just going to take longer to
get to the recession.
So, if we're expecting much slower rates of economic growth over the next 12 to 18 months,
you may not get into a recession until 2025, maybe even 2026.
But a lot of that will, between now and then, is going to depend on how much does the Fed
cut rates?
If they start reversing QT back to QE, which is kind of the hope of the market, could we
avoid a recession in that standpoint?
Yeah.
If you inject enough liquidity back into the markets to offset the contraction in liquidity,
which is going on in terms of M2 as a percentage of GDP, that's declining still.
So if you can supplant that and start producing a lot more liquidity, increase the money supply
again, yeah, you can avoid a recession, but there doesn't seem to be any real incentive
right now to do that.
We'll see.
You know, a lot of fighting, you're running the largest deficit outside of a war ever
in history.
So, at some point, and a lot of this will depend on who gets elected president for the
next cycle, right?
So, if you get a more conservative individual into office that wants to basically reduce
the deficit, get back on a budget, those types of things, which let's be honest, it's not
going to happen.
But if it would happen by some stretch of an imagination, that's certainly not going
to be good for the economy because we just need more debt.
Wow.
Thanks for the chuckle.
That was great.
Hey, let me ask you this question that I've been asking a few people lately.
Here's sort of a thesis that's beginning to chew on, or hypothesis.
So let's fast forward to November, right?
If Biden gets reelected, you know, it seems that a lot of us are intuiting that the administration
is taking kind of an everything plus the kitchen sink approach to just trying to keep everything
duct taped together to look as optically good as it can through the election, right?
Yeah.
Of course.
Of course.
So Biden gets reelected, very well may say, okay, look, a lot of this stuff was super
extraordinary stuff we're doing.
We can't keep doing it forever.
Let's start removing some of this support.
Let's let some of the pressure clear, right?
We got four years to make good on this, right?
So let's like take a breather.
So you can argue, you're going to expect some sort of correction if Biden wins because he's
turning the dial off of 11, right, back down to something a little more manageable.
I don't see any indication of that.
I mean, the people, look, President Biden doesn't do anything, right?
It's all of the people behind it.
It's the whole machine.
Yes.
And that whole machine is very driven to more socialistic needs, right?
So you know, you can imagine.
So look, he just forgave 1.2 billion in student loan debt, even though the Supreme Court said
you can't.
He did.
And so there's another 1.2 billion of stimulus into the economy that people don't have to
pay now.
You can only imagine that after he gets reelected, there's going to be a big push to forgive
all of the student loan debt.
There's going to be a big push for increased child tax credits.
There's going to be a big push for more medical support.
You know, everything that is the anathema of the average American on that left hand
side of the scale, there's going to be more and more push for those goods and for those
supports for the markets, which is just going to be more and more money put in.
And you'll see the debt increase by another 10 trillion and we're going down the road.
But no, I wouldn't expect a negative change if he gets elected.
I would expect an acceleration and a continuation of what he's been doing the last four years.
So again, this is all a hypothesis, my thinking is right now there's an urgency to get as
much as you can in there.
So yeah, another 1.2 billion of student loans, yeah, let's get those approved or forgiven
or whatever.
And so there's a real rush to just whatever we can do in any weakness, I'm calling Jerome
Powell, I'm calling Yellen, just do what you got to do.
After the election, it's kind of like, hey, we got a little bit of time here.
We got time to work on this bigger stuff.
We don't need to be completely balls to the wall that we are right now.
So there's an ebb, a potential ebb.
That's the hypothesis.
Now if Trump wins, well, first Biden stops or the democratic machine stops doing whatever
it's doing because it's leaving and also it doesn't want to do anything to continue to
help Trump.
And then Trump is like, look, hey, I got two years before I'm being judged on my performance.
Let me let anything that I think is unsustainable kind of bleed right here.
And I get to blame it on the prior administration for a while.
So the question, the point is, is like we may get some sort of correction no matter
who wins coming after the election.
Quite possible.
And look, predicting that part of the future is kind of following in your way.
But yeah, I mean, look, this is why markets tend to sell off before the election, historically.
You normally get a five to 10% correction going into the election because nobody knows
for sure who's going to get elected.
And more importantly, it's not, you know, we're all focused on the president.
Right.
You know, it's like, oh, who's going to win?
Biden or Trump?
And that's really not what we should be talking about.
It's who wins the House and the Senate.
Because those the guys in the House are the right guys writing the bills.
The House and the Senate are the ones that are approving those bills and budgets.
Those are the guys that control the money.
Right.
They determine the spending.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, you know, really the big question is, is who's going to win the House and who's
going to win the Senate, you know, in November, and who's going to have control of that going
into with whatever president that you have?
So again, it's going to be gridlock.
That's that has a very vastly different outcome than a Democratic president with Democratic
House and Senate, which is typically preceded recessions.
And, you know, or do you have a, you know, a split Congress or do you have a Republican
controlled House Senate president, which, you know, those are two totally different
things.
Right.
So, you know, those are the those are the issues that the market is going to try to
deal with in July, August, September, October, which is why we think we're going to get a
pretty decent correction before we get to the election, because there's just too many
unknowns going into that election issue.
Well, and especially not even to mention all the social disruption that will occur if Trump
wins the presidency.
I was just about to say, which is, you know, I think you're right logically on what we
should be watching more closely.
But I mean, this election, right?
If it's still legit is Biden and Trump, you're going to have, you know, all the questions
of like, what's it going to be like the day after the election?
Right.
Are we going to have like a runoff?
I mean, is it going to be razor thin like it's been?
Are we going to have some sort of social uprising by whichever party doesn't like the way the
vote went?
And they think it's a stolen election, right?
I mean, this is just such a potential powder keg waiting to happen.
I just feel like that's what everybody is going to be focused on leading up to that.
And legitimately, for legitimate reasons, it's a lot of reasons to be concerned.
Yeah.
No.
And that's why I said that's looking.
And like I said, normally, historically, markets sell off before the election.
And the reason is because they don't know who's going to win.
So don't what policies are going to get tax cuts, tax hikes, whatever.
I think this year, it's even more of the case because they really don't know what the environment
it's not policy.
They don't know what the environment is going to be like after the election.
So you know, again, I think there's a real chance that we could see a decent, you know,
we get this run up continues until, you know, basically, March, April, May, we could get
a correction sooner.
But you know, maybe we get a run through May, June, like we did last year, and then you
get a sell off in the summer, like we did last year.
Okay.
All right.
Well, obviously, we'll be tracking it week to week.
I want to get to bonds real quick, just getting off of AI for a second.
Or as we get off AI, you know, I've raised a lot of questions about AI.
Like I said, I want to bring on a specialist to really kind of help us all understand sort
of where exactly with the state of AI is right now.
What's hype?
What's not?
I will say kind of a funny week, you had both a mind blowing revelation with AI imagery
with Sora.
Have you seen those Sora videos?
Lance?
I have not.
They're unbelievable.
Like literally, I mean the word unbelievable.
It's an AI image video creation service, I guess.
But with very simple prompts, some of the ones they showed was like, show me a fashionable
woman walking down the streets of Tokyo at night.
And it generates this image in like 4K detail.
You would swear it was produced by a kind of movie set.
I mean, it's better than real in many ways.
And they have a whole bunch more like that.
Give me a drone shot of this famous location.
And it looks just like an aerial drone shot of an incredibly detailed seacoast.
It's unbelievable what this thing can do.
And apparently the prompts are about as simple as I just mentioned that you don't have to
be a sophisticated programmer to try to get this stuff.
So it's sort of showing how fast and quickly AI generated video imagery is becoming.
So folks, if you haven't seen it yet, just go online, just type in Sora videos and watch
a few of the clips.
They literally are mind blowing.
Now you contrast that with the Google image searches that just came out, right?
Really skewed in terms of the ethnicities of, I guess it was very challenging to get
certain ethnicities to come up.
And it showed that the programming of the AI had obviously been highly influenced by
human programmers.
And that's one of the potential issues of AI going forward is if the inputs aren't great,
the outputs aren't necessarily great.
But look, I mean, I do think, look, I get the academic promise of AI and who knows how
linearly we'll head to that much better future.
But if you see things like Sora and you're like, "Oh my God, the videography industry
should be lying awake at night in fear that they're just not going to be needed going
forward."
Well, not only that though, the video game industry that requires programmers to build
these video games, look, YouTube channels.
All these YouTube programmers that are YouTube, people that have YouTube channels don't really
need you.
Helen on YouTube channels like you and I.
Yeah, no, honestly, don't really need you Adam.
I mean, I can just write a script, load it in and there's already programs that will
do this, but they'll basically take my script, take my image and make a complete AI generated
video out of it.
And it won't be me, but it'll look like me.
It'll sound like me and they'll tell you everything I want you to know.
So the problem with AI, and again, this is what we've talked about before, is there's
a good side and a dark side.
Yes, it increases productivity, but increases in productivity have a dark side, which is
lower wages and lower rates of economic prosperity.
So yeah, technology is awesome.
Internet has been great.
Again, lower wages, lower economic prosperity, less full-time employment relative to the
population.
You can go back and look at it and say, this is all great stuff, it's fantastic, but what's
it really doing for us?
Is it really creating a better world for our kids to live in?
That's the real question you should be asking.
And so as we go down this road, say, what's the real benefit of AI?
Is going down this benefit, and look, I'm not making a case one way or the other, mind
you, but I'm just saying that somebody should be asking, this AI is great, but what's this
really going to do to our economy?
What's this going to do to jobs?
What's this going to do to families?
And again, Google is, if the inputs coming in are historically inaccurate, so when you
ask for a picture of founding fathers, they are not what founding fathers look like.
And there was a big thing on the news this morning comparing mid journey, which is another
AI service that creates images, just like the Google one does, and mid journey is historically
correct.
Google was 900 light years away from being historically correct, but it was all the biases
of Google that were impacting it.
So if AI, if whatever's ultimately going to be AI does not have the correct historical
facts, then the information it produces is deleterious to the long term growth of the
economy.
Because if we don't understand and know our history, we're doomed to repeat our history.
And so if we keep whitewashing our history in order to create a different environment
that we're in, we're going to start duplicating the same mistakes that got us into trouble
to start with.
Well, so yes, and I want to be cautious around the term whitewashing because I don't think
you are and my concern, which I share, is not ethnically or racially based thing.
It's just if it's not truthful.
And so we get back to the global core thing.
So AI becomes a reality and everything, we get all our information from AI, all our content
is AI generated.
Whether it's a human bias or an AI intelligence bias that starts to say, hey, I actually want
people to be influenced in one way or another, we'll never know because all our content sources
will be singing from the same song sheet and we're not going to have any way to disprove
it because it'll be an AI world at that point.
It's basically Fahrenheit 454 and that's why the firemen burned the books because they
had, if you go read the book, they had transferred everything from print into digital, slightly
changed the narrative when it went digital to create the outcome that they wanted and
then they burned all the books.
So you had no factual basis.
And it's actually interesting because we're seeing a lot of this.
My wife and I have been having this conversation now for a couple of months because, for instance,
the song by Queen, "We Are the Champions."
How does that song, now Adam, how does that song end?
What's the last few words of "We Are the Champions" when the song ends?
Oh my God, "We are the champions of the world."
God, if you weren't telling me on the spot, I could get it.
No, that's it.
We are the champions of the world except when you listen to the song now, it just says we
are the champions and the song ends.
And so there's a whole big debate running around right now that, no, that's the way
the song is.
It never said, "We are the world."
And everybody that I talked to that grew up with that song goes, "No, it ended.
We are the champions of the world."
Fruit of the Loom says that they never had the cornucopia on their underwear.
People are finding old pairs of underwear with the cornucopia on it.
So we're just going through this whole time where things that were true before have been
changed in this timeline, so to speak.
And now there's this big debate going on about what's real and what's not.
All right.
So you're raising an even bigger existential thing that I was going to raise, but we should
be having a national discussion about AI and the role we want it to have and obviously
the pace at which we pursue it because we could end up at the dystopian endpoint you're
sort of warning about here, which is like, "We'll just never be able to trust anything
and we'll be victims of the manipulation of our reality."
Well, the good thing is once all those old people die, then there'll be nobody to debate
the issue of whether we are the champions of the world at the end of the song or not.
It'll just be what it is.
So you just got to get rid of this generation, and then you're good to go.
Yeah.
Well, they're hustling us towards the door, but there's one other big issue about AI that's
relevant to this.
And we've talked about it once or twice in the past, but the economist Keynes actually
coined this term technological displacement, which is, "Hey, if technology can replace
human labor, you should do it.
It's more efficient, more economically effective, but you have to be careful of the pace at
which you displace that labor.
You got to displace the labor at a slower rate than you are transitioning to displaced
labor to additional productive use."
And I think what AI threatens to do here is displace a lot of labor really fast and not
give it another place to go.
So the promise we have is, "Oh, you'll have more leisure and convenience."
And it's sort of like, whenever that tends to happen, we have all the world's knowledge
in this device right here.
And what do we do with it?
We watch the TikTok videos and cat videos and stuff like that.
It didn't mean to send mean text to people we don't even know.
Send mean text.
Yeah.
We just go home and get depressed and feel lonely and all this stuff, right?
But that's my whole point is that you go back and look ever since the, really ever go back
to the advent of a Federal Express, and yes, we're making things more and more convenient.
Technology is certainly displacing labor and now we have these conversations.
I was listening to this congresswoman out in California and she's advocating for $50
hour minimum wage.
Yeah, that's great.
Barbara Lee.
Barbara Lee.
Thank you.
But the whole point is though, is that, and we talked about McDonald's before and to have
a fully automated McDonald's, there's no employees whatsoever.
And look at how many jobs when you walk into places now have kiosks to order and they've
displaced cashiers and there's a lot of places won't even take cash now, you've just got
to use debit or credit, so they have to deal with that.
But we're displacing labor right now at the bottom end of the labor curve, so we don't
really worry about it.
It's like, "Oh yeah, it's just those lower end wage workers that are getting displaced
by technology."
Us in the white collar community, we're all safe, fine and dandy.
Well, you're not safe, fine and dandy from AI because AI can do engineering, it can do
legal, it can do accounting, it can do it all.
And there's no job that'll be safe, doctors, you're on the chopping block because once
AI figures out how to operate the robots that do the operations, we don't need you anymore.
So there's a lot larger risk of job displacement and economic displacement from AI than there
was even from just the advent of the internet and technology in terms of apps and programs.
No, I totally agree and that's what I'm worrying about is we end up creating a very material
displaced class of labor that is now productive, but in 10 years may not be, and a lot of it
might not have a lot of other options, right?
Because we've mechanized and automated and outsourced all the lower skilled jobs and
AI is eating more and more of the higher skilled jobs and what do we do?
And that's when programs like MMT and just, "Hey, everybody stay home and subsist on your
government subsidy," and I don't think anybody aspires to that world.
Well, right.
But that was, you remember under the Obama administration when we first launched the
Affordable Care Act and we were talking about increased health benefits and all this at
a lower cost.
And I think it was Nancy Pelosi, don't quote me, but I believe it was her, at that time
it was like, "Well, because of this plan, you can just stay home and you will learn
to play the guitar, play the guitar," right?
But at some point, somebody's got to produce something in order to have an economic society.
We can't just all sit at home and be artists because if we were, who's going to produce
the canvas?
Who's going to produce the paint?
Who's going to produce the brushes?
Somebody's got to be working somewhere, right?
And this is the fallacy behind this whole idea of MMT and everything else is like, "Oh,
you'll just have all this time to just pursue life and be happy and the government will
pay for everything."
This is the whole World Economic Forum, you'll rent everything, you'll own nothing and you'll
be happy.
I'm not sure that that works in reality because everybody's now at the very bottom end of
the wealth scale and I'm not sure they're actually happy there.
No, I mean, look, so anyways, like I said, it's not a future we want to aspire to.
Look, I got to bring it back to some of the economic stuff while we still have time here.
So bonds, so two things.
So the FOMC minutes were released this week and they show that actually most of the folks
on the Fed Open Market Committee, if they had a bias, it's a bias towards not cutting
too soon, that, "Hey, we think we can create more issues if we're too optimistic here."
And this week we had three Fed officials, Cook, Jefferson and Waller who reinforced
the message that they want to be cautious and Waller kind of freaked folks out this
week saying in a speech, "Whatever word you pick, they all translate to one idea.
What's the rush?"
So coming into this year, the markets thought, "All right, Fed's pivoting now and we're
going to get a bunch of rate cuts and they're going to start right away."
Everybody was thinking that they were going to start in March.
Now that seems very much off the table.
The market as usual has been forced to bring down its estimate for rate hikes for the year.
I think it's now close to three.
So the expectation by the market to rate cuts is now the same as the Fed.
Now the same as the Fed, but the Fed may very well now have to push out the start of its
cutting.
One, because inflation still being a little bit stubborn here and two, with this melt
up in the market, financial conditions have gotten real loose.
So I guess the question is for the bond market, what does higher for longer mean if that's
indeed what we have versus recent expectations and related to that, what is stickier for
longer?
Look, if inflation does prove to be stickier for longer.
Well, it just means that rates won't come down.
When we started talking about the bond trade last year, we said, "Look, this is our outlook
for 18 to 36 months."
So here we are about eight, nine, 10 months into that debate and because rates haven't
gone to zero, everybody's going, "Well, maybe rates won't go down that fast."
Well, yeah, they were never going to go down that fast.
That's when we said 18 to 36 months.
It's going to take a while because you've got to slow.
Look, as we've said before, we've done this math numerous times, interest rates are a
function of inflation and economic growth.
So if inflation gets stuck at three, three and a quarter and economic growth slows to
three or two and a half, then yields will eventually work their way down to two and
a half to three percent.
So right now yields are about four and a quarter, actually a little bit below that today, right
around four percent.
So yields are overvalued relative to where inflation is and where economic growth will
be over the course of this year.
So as economic growth continues to slow, yields will fall, but it's going to take time, they're
just not going to go down.
Now, as soon as the Fed starts cutting rates, yields will fall more quickly because now
the Fed is actually lowering that interest rate on the short end.
So the long end will come down with the short end, but that's all going to ultimately reflect
back.
So if the Fed goes to two percent, inflation gets to two, which it will over time, then
yields should at the minimum be two.
And if we're in a recession, then yields will be near zero.
All right, but in the short term here, by short term, I mean maybe the next two quarters
or so.
He might be stuck right around four for the next quarter or so.
Yeah.
OK.
So I know you and your partner, Mike Leibowitz, a couple of months ago were saying, hey, this
may be the time to go further out the duration curve on bonds.
Are you kind of putting that on pause right now?
Are you continuing with that process?
Yeah, no, absolutely.
Whenever we get an uptick and like we got the four and a quarter here just recently,
and so we moved some of our short end into the longer duration.
And so we're just shifting the whole ladder of the bond portfolio, continuing to use upticks
and yields as an opportunity to shift out that duration.
So again, if we break four, then we'll move that duration a little bit more quickly because
if we break four, sustain below four, then the next move will likely be lower towards
3%.
OK.
OK.
So again, the problem that people have is that they like this idea of the bond trade,
but they have no patience for it.
Well, they're looking at it as a trade, like, OK, this is something I'm going to be in for
a very short period of time.
And you've said, to your point, it could take up to 36 months, so I mean, you're being consistent.
It could be longer.
I mean, there's a risk.
It could be four years.
It could be five years.
I mean, there's so many things that can happen economically over that time frame that the
timing is always difficult.
But what we do know is that because of the debt, because of the deficits, because of
where economic growth is, that yields will be lower, not higher in the future.
OK.
All right.
So key thing for folks, because I get asked this in between our videos every week, I'm
sure you do too.
You guys aren't changing your tune.
You're not sweating bullets at all.
On what?
Bonds?
On bonds.
On your bond position.
Yeah.
Not at all.
No, we're very optimistic on bonds.
And like I said, if you actually take a look at the 10-year bond yield, it's been kind
of basing very nicely right along support, turned up nicely today, as a matter of fact.
So we may have another bottom put in for bond yields short term.
So there might be a potential for a little short term trade here.
If you're just looking for short term swing trade, it won't be big, might be like where
we are to say we were four to quarter, maybe to 3.9, and then you're out.
But no, long term, we're very optimistic that bonds are going to outperform stocks most
likely.
OK.
All right.
I want to switch to another topic here real quick, just to kind of track what's happening
with the consumer.
You can hopefully see my screen here, Lance.
But there's a report that just came out here that talks about how Americans are facing
a credit card debt crisis.
So you were talking about how small businesses were increasingly struggling here and were
facing issues with their debt rerate that's coming up.
We're seeing something similar with the consumer market.
So I'm going to try to display some of these charts at their full resolution here.
But here is a chart of total debt and basically showing that consumer debt is continuing to
spike and took a big spike.
No huge surprise.
Hold on a second.
So that's actually counseling volume by month.
So these are the number of clients that are getting debt counseling.
Right.
Exactly.
And then the debt balance is on the bottom.
Yeah.
OK.
That's very interesting.
OK.
Keep going.
Yeah.
OK.
So more people are raising their hands and saying, hey, I need help here.
Right.
I'm taking a little too much debt.
If you come down here, you can see this is a chart of the serious loan delinquency by
loan type.
And you can see that it's really starting to pick up now, particularly in autos, which
is the green line here.
And then in credit cards.
Right.
So you can see the credit card delinquency rate has gone from, what, about 3 percent
in Q1 of 2022.
It's now over double that.
Yeah.
It's interesting that student loans aren't showing a delinquency pickup because we are
seeing since the restart of the student loan payments, there's a very large percentage
of them that aren't making them.
So they're just not reporting them as delinquent.
Yeah.
And you can imagine optically, they probably don't want to heading into an election.
Right.
Yeah.
And then here is rise in credit card debt.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Let's see here.
This is delinquencies in total debt and then in credit card debt.
And let me just see if I can get a bigger picture here for folks.
But the blue line is total debt.
And you can see that that is actually picking back up again, not quite where it was pre-COVID.
But that's because there was both debt paydowns that happened as well as huge forbearance
programs.
But the trajectory isn't very good.
But look at credit card.
I mean, credit card debt is at a much higher or faster trajectory here.
And what this doesn't include, but I'm looking for data and I haven't been able to get it,
is I want to see what the delinquency rate on these buy now, pay later programs looks
like.
Yeah.
So do I. And I feel like whatever it is now, it's going to be some multiple of it in about
a year.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Buy now, pay when?
Yeah.
Or pay never, right?
That's what folks are saying the N stands for.
And then the last chart here I want to show is this chart here, which is the debts are
increasing.
The total debt volume is increasing.
But as we've been waving a lot of this program, Lance, the average interest rate on these
credit cards is much higher than it's been.
It's at record highs now.
So the consumer is really in a tough spot here.
So no wonder that we're beginning to see these delinquencies.
And you're familiar with this as we've seen and we've gone into previous recessions.
The delinquency rates, they remain low.
And then once they start getting into trouble, they tend to just spike real fast.
It's usually just over a quarter or two, and the same thing happens with home foreclosures
and whatnot.
They're not seeing too much trouble yet in mortgage defaults, although I have heard that
they're beginning to see some precursors to increase in foreclosures and mortgage defaults.
Obviously, we'll be tracking those really closely.
But it seems like the weaker points, the people that have high credit card balances and have
no other choice but to put stuff on the credit card for as long as the card companies will
loan to them, they're starting to fall into trouble here.
And this is, as we talked about before, is that the economy is doing fine right now.
But all those stimuluses, all those supports, all those bailouts, they're coming to an end.
And so, yes, we're not in a recession yet.
I don't think we'll be in one this year.
It's possible.
But given the fact that we're still running about 3.5% GDP growth, that's still a pretty
big decline that we've got to get to zero to go negative.
But 2024, I think, is a real possibility.
This is why I find it interesting, in 2022, all experts thought we were going to have
a recession.
Now nobody expects one, which is, as Bob Farrell once says, when all experts agree something
else tends to happen, you've now got a good setup for having a recession because now everybody's
in the Goldilocks game.
Right.
Well, I mean, as you just said, the NIFB just threw in the towel, right?
Yeah.
No, not FNIB.
Conference Board did.
Oh, Conference Board did.
OK.
Sorry.
Yeah.
So, I mean, that tends to be sort of one of those classic turning points, right?
It's almost like an economist or Barron's front page article, right?
Exactly.
Usually, whatever trend it's touting, that's the high watermark, and then it reverts.
All right.
Well, look, I want to get to your trades and get to a rant or two.
Real quick, I just wanted to make a brief note of, I'm probably going to pronounce his
name wrong, but is it Malay?
Is that the Argentinian president?
That is the Argentinian president.
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing his name correctly or not, but a firebrand politician, total
outsider, came in with a platform he was going to clean house, reversing the economic issue
of the country was the main part of his platform, and he has secured the first budget surplus
in Argentina since 2012 after just one month in office, right?
And I don't know the details of it.
I pretty much just noted the headline, but what I wanted to note is if indeed he has
done that, kudos to him, right?
And not sort of unlike Elon Musk, when Elon Musk got rid of 70% of the employees at Twitter
and has been running the company ever since with the remaining 25%, there's a lot of things
that we just think in our current system are just not possible because we've gotten so
conditioned to the rules by which the system operates that we just don't think that they
can be revised in any material way, right?
And we get so used to a certain way of doing something that we just think, ah, that could
never happen, right?
And when you get a change agent that comes in and says, yeah, and hey, this might not
be easy.
It might not be painless, but we can do this.
We can choose to do this differently.
I think back to sort of making a tangential comment here, but I think back to the interview
I did with Doomburg about energy supply, future energy supply, and he made the comment that
political constraints are much easier to overcome than geological ones, meaning there are big
parts of our current energy supply system that are only the way they are because of
laws and regulations and decisions that we put in place.
We could change those tomorrow.
It seems unfathomable to people that we might, but we could, right?
We could decide to do things very differently, right?
So the fact that Malay is coming in and basically saying, look, we've had this basket case of
an economy for the past 10 years and then is able to get a budget surplus in this first
month shows that, hey, yeah, folks, things are really possible.
Now we might break a lot of things.
A lot of people might lose their jobs that had cushy jobs or were committed to doing
it the old way, but change is possible.
We just have to open our imaginations to it and have the discipline, the courage to do
it.
Yeah.
No, that's absolutely right.
I just don't have politicians that will do that.
Yeah.
And I mean, again, I'm amazed, again, I don't know the details of how he might've engineered
this.
And I think one question with this guy is how long is he going to be allowed to do it
before he gets a dagger in the back or whatever.
But we'll see.
All right.
Well, look, trades.
What trades have you guys made over the past week, if any?
Basically we, you know, before the, I said this earlier in the show, but just to recap,
we trimmed back on Nvidia, AMD.
We also bought, had a position in Diamondback Energy that bought Endeavor, which is one
of the largest Permian Basin plays in Texas, and they bought that as a private company.
Stock was up, you know, 15, 18% of the news.
So we trimmed that back a little bit.
It just kind of got, it's been running up a lot more than the rest of the energy drillers.
So we just trimmed that back a little bit just to bring in some profits, you know, because
again, we'll probably get a bit of a correction to the energy space, but energy is actually
looking pretty good.
So we kind of like some of the energy names that we hold right now.
We think those will do better as we get, head towards summer.
Also we get a rotation.
And then outside of that, we did buy a very small starter position in Palo Alto Networks
because of their cybersecurity exposure on this recent pullback.
It's a company we've meant one to buy for a long time, just couldn't get an entry point,
finally got one.
Okay.
And, you know, part of a good capital manager is to look for good entry points.
And as you said, their stock was down, what, like 26, 27%?
26% sitting on a 200 day moving average.
So again, this is, you know, that's the one thing we keep talking about a lot is that
these stocks that are grossly deviated from their 200 day moving averages, those are like
magnets.
Eventually they're going to correct back to their 200 day moving average.
And so when you get that opportunity, those are often good entry points.
Okay.
And as an entry point, are you taking sort of like an initial position and then hoping
to get more, or was this like a, oh my gosh, this is on sale, got to get a buy as much
as possible?
No, no, no.
When you have a stock that drops 26%, generally what you'll get is you'll get a bounce out
of it.
And then everybody, you know, all the kind of the retail traders that were chasing it
on the way up and they wake up one morning and they're down 26, 27% of their position,
and they fall into the trap of, okay, Lord, if you'll please just let me get some money
back, you know, I'll sell it.
I'll never buy the stock again.
So you generally get the stock to run up a little bit because, you know, bottom fishers
come in like us.
And then when it runs up, you get all the trap, what we'll call trapped longs.
They sell, price comes back down, forms a second bottom.
And that's the point where we'll take a much bigger position.
Okay.
All right.
Well look, heading into the rant part of the day, and this doesn't have to be that long,
but you and I have talked about this theory that, you know, when my wife calls it, she's
a marriage family therapist and with teens, she calls it the five monkey syndrome, which
is you're the average of the five people that you choose to spend most of your time with.
So choose wisely, and you've said the same thing with your kids, right?
You've encouraged them to do the same thing.
And I think that's true in life, kind of about whomever you choose to associate with, right?
And that's true of business partners and contractors and vendors that you work with, things like
that.
And so, you know, if you want to be successful in life, very important to pick wisely in
terms of, you know, whom you choose to do business with and work with and learn from
and listen to.
And in general, you should always be on a journey of like constantly upgrading, right?
Especially with like the professionals that you work with.
So, you know, for example, I probably, I can't tell you sort of how many accountants and
lawyers that I've worked with because I've worked with, you know, worked with one until
I found one that actually, you know, met my services needs better, right?
And I just kept trying to upgrade, you know, each provider as I'd go along.
Yeah.
But I agree with you, upgrading is great, but not with your wife.
So yeah, I said, well, that's because you want to make the best decision the first time
that you can.
And an important part of it, and this is sort of where I'm going, which is, it's the having
the wherewithal, the awareness and the courage to cut bait or, you know, to address issues
and if they can't be quickly resolved, cut bait early on in these relationships.
I can't tell you how many times I have, and this all came up because I was wrestling with
one provider right now where I've just been like, I've just been not quite satisfied with
it for now I'm realizing a lot longer than I should have been.
And so the ability to say, look, this isn't personal.
It's just business.
But these are the requirements I have and I keep finding myself just not getting exactly
what I need from your service or from this relationship or whatnot.
And in having the ability to say, look, it's not on you.
It's just not a good fit and I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Pardon me?
It's not you.
Well, whatever.
But the point is, you know, we're all conflict avoidant in general.
I think a lot of times, too, people will sort of hire a professional to do a service for
them and just have the assumption, well, because they're a professional, they're obviously
going to do a good job and they kind of let it go on autopilot.
But I think there's a real value to, you know, being really honest with yourself and saying,
look, you know, for what I'm paying and what I need, am I getting the value that I need?
And if I'm not, let me address it right away, however uncomfortable that conversation or
series of conversations might be.
And if it's not going the direction I want to have it go in, hey, I can end it and I
can transition to somebody better.
Yeah.
And it's going to take some time on my part to do legwork and find somebody better.
Maybe there's going to be a gap where I've left the other person and I haven't found
the next person yet.
But I just think back in my life where I have either stayed too long in situations when
famously in my mind is I worked for Yahoo for almost a decade, about halfway through
there.
I was realizing I wasn't really growing and developing that much.
And I got pretty advanced in discussions with Google.
And then another opportunity at Yahoo came in and again, sort of my better judgment at
the time, they kind of pulled me in and said, oh, we really need you for this and please
stay for this.
And I ended up, you know, spending time on that and the opportunity at Google went away.
And, you know, now that I look back over time, I'm like, oh my God, I would have some so
much better certified Google then both financially, but also just an interest in what I'd been
doing.
And so I guess I'm just going with this is to encourage people to kind of look at the
association of folks they have around them, ask themselves whether it's a personal relationship
or a business one.
Is this serving me the way that I hope it will?
And if not say, OK, look, we're the ones where I need to sit down and have what might be
an uncomfortable conversation, but one that can hopefully break me through to an elevation
of getting to a better place, either with that person or with a replacement, if I've
got to go out and find a replacement, I think way too many people.
You know, out of avoidance or whatever, just don't do that and you end up sort of just
getting stuck with something that's that's, you know, not optimal.
Yeah.
No, I mean, the really kind of the key issue is expectations.
And this is this goes for marriage as well as it goes with working with people for business
or, you know, even like your financial advisor, you know, we often have expectations of, oh,
this person is going to do ABC because, you know, that's what I perceive their role to
be.
And this is what I expect them to do.
But you never actually communicated that to the other person.
And this is a big this is a big problem in marriages that there's this on both sides,
right?
You know, the wives expect the husbands to do certain things that you don't do, but they
didn't tell you.
And same thing, husbands kind of expect their wife to do certain things that they never
expressed.
They just assume that this person would know.
And I can talk about financial advisory because this happens a lot.
But by the way, you're describing about 95% of my wife's client meetings.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, no expectations and communication.
We're not lined up.
Yeah.
Right.
And that's and but that's ultimately always the problem is that, you know, our clients
will come in as like, well, you know, I was expecting I was going to get 15 percent a
year.
It's like, well, hey, you never said that because we would think, you know, as a client,
if you did, you came in and said you were super conservative, didn't want to lose money.
So, you know, expect, you know, communicating your expectations with the people you're dealing
with up front is crucially important because you can save yourself a lot of time because
if you go, you know, hey, I want 15 percent a year in returns, I'm gonna tell you upfront,
hey, can't do that.
You know, you need to go find another advisor.
So you just saved yourself the whole time of having to go through a period of lost time.
So or if you come to me and say, you know, hey, this was my expectation.
OK, great.
That's reasonable.
I can certainly meet that.
You didn't tell me that before.
I didn't realize that was your expectation.
But now that I know, I can certainly meet that for you.
And so you can create a better relationship with whoever you're dealing with, including
your wife, if you'll just communicate.
And, you know, communication is hard because you're always worried about two things, right?
You're worried about offending their feelings or you're worrying about rejection.
And, you know, neither one of those are bad.
It's just they're uncomfortable.
And to your point, Adam, we don't like being uncomfortable.
But if you can learn to deal with being uncomfortable, you'll move a lot faster through your progress.
Thank you for making it.
That's the point I'm trying to make here, which is getting comfortable with discomfort.
It's like a superpower.
Yeah, it is.
But look what we've done on social media.
It's like you brought it up today on the show, just as just as an example, right?
I said the word whitewash immediately.
You had to go and say, well, you know, we're not talking about being racial or anything
like that.
That's what social media has done to society.
We're so worried about offending somebody's nature that we're not willing to speak the
truth.
And this is this is the problem that we are creating and engendering across society and
why there is an inability to have a discussion about anything.
Look, it is my right to offend you.
It is your right to be offended and you can offend me back.
That is OK.
When we were growing up in the 70s, there was this old saying called sticks and stones
may break your bones, but words will never hurt me.
You know, that's just the way things are.
But we're so worried about offending somebody or hurting somebody's feelings that we're
completely destroying the ability to communicate with one another.
And that's the worst outcome possible.
Yeah.
Well, and also there's there's there's ways to do this right to go through discomfort
where, you know, you don't have to be a bad person.
It doesn't have to be a terrible experience.
And one of the things that I've I've found has been really helpful in my professional
relationships and I take this in a certain direction in just a second.
But it's just saying to one of the companies, if you've got a professional that you're engaging
with for something and you're not feeling like it's not clear to you if you're getting
enough value out of it, just say, hey, I just like to talk about the fact that, OK, we can
agree I'm paying you X.
How exactly are you earning that for me?
Like just just I'm having trouble seeing it.
I'm not I'm not making an accusation.
I'm just trying to understand it.
Can you please help me sort of break down why I'm getting how I'm getting what I'm paying
for.
Right.
And it's a fair question to be able to ask somebody.
It's a bit of an uncomfortable question to ask them.
But if they can't answer it to your level of satisfaction, then, yeah, who can argue
if you say, well, hey, you know what, I just think maybe it's time for me to move on then.
Right.
So you're way too nice.
I just say I don't feel like I'm getting what I'm paying for.
Explain this to me.
Well, I said I said the whole dancing around thing.
Yeah, I just got right to say I said it's like whatever, whatever your style is.
But yeah, but I mean, you don't have to like be finger pointy or getting, you know, shouting
matches with each other.
It's just just keep it real focused on the facts and kind of relate to this.
This is this is just another thing I wanted to bring up is.
This is my rant, which is for a lot of professional services, you know, whether they're I mean,
I can't tell you how many times a day I get emails from media consultants and people that
are offering services that they are going to catalyze thoughtful money to the next level
of success.
But whenever I work with or I initially get in contact with a professional services provider,
you know, the vast majority of them, they have a fee structure.
Right.
And it's here's my rate, pay my rate and then I'll do what you want me to do for you.
And you know, in many of these cases, I when I whenever I've done in the past, I've always
been really begrudging going in because I'm like, look, if this doesn't work out, you're
still going to get paid.
I'm going to have already paid you.
Right.
And how many times have you especially with like a media consultant, right?
Like how many times that somebody promised you the world.
And then, you know, you pay them their retainer or whatever.
And as time goes on, you know, they come up with every excuse in the book of why.
Well, it's for some reason, your business is different this time.
It's not responding to the normal things that we do.
Maybe if you give me some more money, I'll try this.
Right.
And you begin to learn as you're just shelling out the money.
It's like, wait a minute, this guy's got no skin in the game.
Right.
Like, he's just milking me and not saying all consultants are like this.
But there are a few that more than a few, they kind of make their living on just I'm
going to always have several different clients.
And I just know that their average lifetime is going to be three to five months before
they catch on that I'm not really, you know, adding that much value.
But collectively, they pay me a nice salary over time.
And you know how to read through those guys really quick is that you tell them, say, look,
I'll tell you what I will pay you double your rate after the fact.
So if you do what you say you can do, I will pay you double your rate.
I do this to people all the time.
And immediately they'll say that that's not how we work.
You have to pay us up front.
So I know that they're going to be the person you just described.
Every once in a while, I will find the guy says, yeah, I'll do that.
And I'll hire that guy.
Well, and so you're taking this exactly where I wanted to take it.
And nine times out of ten, they do exactly what they say they're going to do.
And I'm more than happy to pay them more than what they're worth.
Well, absolutely.
Or at least, you know, you pay them what it's worth to you to get the job done.
Right.
Right.
Yeah, that's my point.
Yes.
Yeah.
So my point here is that what I have learned is that everything is negotiable, right?
You ask somebody how much it costs, you know, a lawyer, an accountant, a marketing guy,
whatever.
Right.
And they say, well, this is my fee.
I'm going to admit it.
You know, like, here's what I really care about.
Can we structure this in such a way that, you know, it's either performance based, you
know, I'm concerned about getting taken for a ride here.
I want to have some protections in place in case you don't do your job right.
And you begin to kind of learn that in business and really in all aspects of life, absolutely
everything's negotiable.
Right.
If the person actually thinks they can provide real value for you and they want their business,
they will work with you to structure in a way that makes you comfortable.
Until Lance's point, maybe you end up paying more under certain conditions, but you've
reduced the risk in those conditions.
And if you're happy with that, you know, hey, if the guy actually does what he say and we
agree on what the, you know, the outputs are, if they're hit, I'm happy to pay that amount.
Like that's the way to do it.
Right.
So I just want to give people the hope and the faith that like, hey, if you're feeling
kind of taking advantage of, you know, folks that you're working with professionally, you
know, a have the courage to have those tough questions and move on.
If you're not getting the answers you like, but when you're, when you're reaching out
to other people, if their initial offer isn't what you want, work with them to structure
something differently.
And if they're worth their salt, nine times out of 10, they'll do it.
Or the other, the other option is that they are worth their salt.
And this is me, people will come and say, well, you do this for me.
I'll go, yeah, this is what I'll charge you.
And then they'll say, well, you know, that's a little more than I was thinking about paying.
It's like, well, go find somebody else, you know, because I know what I do.
I know what I can do.
And I know what my skill set is and I know what my skill set is worth.
And so if you run into that person that says, here's my fee, it's non-negotiable.
And if you don't want to pay it, that's fine, go away.
That's probably a guy to consider a guy or girl to consider also, because they are that
confident that they can do the job they promised to do.
So either they will work on, you know, hey, pay me more.
I'll perform first and you pay me more in the end, or this is my rate up front.
Take it or leave it.
Those are probably the people you're looking for.
Yeah, I want to agree with you on that second one.
And I agree that there's probably half in that population that are so good that they're
just demanding what they're worth.
And I think there's another half there that just has a wildly outsized sense of their
own value.
No, no.
You've got to be careful.
Yeah, you do.
But I mean, but normally if you go to a person, they go, this is my rate.
And that's it.
It's non-negotiable.
It usually means they have enough business elsewhere that they really don't need your
business.
Right.
And, you know, that's kind of the point I'm getting to.
If they're successful in what they're doing, they really don't need your business.
They're happy to take you on as a client and they'll work for you, but they're not going
to negotiate the rate because they already know what they're worth because they've already
got a big client list.
Yeah.
I mean, who knows, some of those guys probably won't do this, but because I agree, look,
I'm totally on the train of get the best person, get the best, like pay for quality basically.
And so if somebody does that, you want to do the other due diligence to talk to previous
clients of theirs and things like that to make sure that they're really legit in the
real deal.
But secondly, you know, say like, hey, look, I'm willing to take a flyer on you.
You're not budging.
You must be that good.
But if there's a total failure of delivery, you know, I want term X or whatever that just
says I'm not left holding a bag.
Right.
And anybody who's worth their salt should be able to agree to something there.
Yeah.
And again, my point was more around like a neurosurgeon.
You go to a top neurosurgeon, they don't negotiate with you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is my rate.
You want me to work on your brain?
This is what it's going to cost you.
Yeah.
All right.
So don't languish in a relationship, professional, personal, that's not serving you.
Developing the ability to have those tough conversations to get to a decision as to whether
to reinvest or to cut bait.
It's like a personal superpower.
And know that you have a ton of agency in this, right?
That terms for anybody are negotiable, right?
Or you get to the point where the guy says, look, it's this way or the highway, and then
you can choose.
Right.

A reminder that the Thoughtful Money Spring Conference is coming up real quick now on
Saturday, March 16th, and don't worry if you can't watch the event live, everybody who
registers will be sent replay videos of the entire event, both all of the presentations
as well as all the live Q&A sessions.
A good note, too, we just locked in Melody Wright.
She's going to be the real estate expert for the conference.
I'm very excited.
I just talked with her about what she's seeing most recently in the markets, and she's got
some data that's really kind of eye opening.
And a reminder that if you are a premium subscriber to our sub stack, you not only get the lowest
early bird price discount price, which is going to be going away in just a week.
So make sure you respond quickly to lock that in.
But if you're a premium subscriber to the sub stack, you also get an additional $50
off of that lowest early bird price.
And look, you know, Lance and I have talked about how this market is, the bulls are running,
but how long are they going to run for?
And if we do get a correction in this seemingly melt up that we're into, you know, what implications
are that going to have for folks?
For the average person, this is pretty heady market action to follow.
And you know, if you get to a point where, you know, the market starts reversing or important
things in your portfolio need to be going on, like the position sizing that Lance always
talks about, for the average person, we highly recommend that you leverage the expertise
of a good professional financial advisor who understands and focuses on all the issues
that Lance and I have talked about here, as well as all the macro issues that I talk about
on this channel regularly with our experts.
If you've got a good one who's doing that for you, great, stick with them.
If not, or if you'd like a second opinion from one who does perhaps even Lance and his
team there at Real Investment Advice, consider scheduling a free consultation with one of
the financial advisors that Thoughtful Money endorses.
To do that, just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com, fill out the short form there.
Again, these consultations are totally free.
There's no strings attached.
There's no commitment to work with these guys.
It's just a free public service they offer.
Lance, as usual, I'm going to give you the last word here, my friend.
All right.
Have a great week.
We'll see you back here next Friday.
All right.
That was pretty easy.
All right, Lance.
Thanks so much for your time of the week.
Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
I'll see you next time.
Thank you.
