Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its
founder and your host Adam Taggart
back at the end of another week with my
good friend the juggernaut portfolio
manager Lance Roberts. How are you doing
Lance? I'm good. I'm good. You know the
juggernaut's the guy that wears the suit
just runs through walls so I guess that
is me. That is right so that's the x-men
character. The juggernaut has a
is a millennia old definition but it's
basically an unstoppable force
which I think that's pretty good of
your character. I think it's pretty
accurate but certainly describes the
market rally right now. That thing just
keeps on going. So I want to talk about
the latest price action in the markets.
We'll get to your S&P charts real quick.
Folks, before we dive into that I just
want to remind folks we're now a week
away from Thoughtful Money's spring
conference so if you have not bought
your tickets yet folks, pause this video,
go do it right now, get that out of the
way, make sure you don't miss it. It's
going to be a phenomenal day. Yes sir? I
was gonna say and if you do it right now,
he'll give you that early bird discount
just for doing it right now.
Thanks, now we're going to edit that out
buddy but you will get us that against
you knives. No but seriously folks it's
going to be amazing. We're going to have
Lacey Hunt do the keynote. We'll have
Stephanie Pomboy. We'll have Ted Oakley.
We'll have Michael Pinto. We'll have
Danielle DiMartino Booth. We'll have
Brent Johnson. We'll have Tom McClellan.
We'll have
Melody Wright on housing. We'll have Matt
Heifenberg
talking about gold. We'll have Mark Moss
talking about Bitcoin. Of course we'll
have all of our financial advisors like
Lance and the guys from New Harbor and
Jonathan Wellen from Canada so it is
amazing brain trust you'd be able to tap
into that day. It's going to be wonderful.
Alright, so moving on to the juggernaut
at hand,
Lance. Yes. So let's talk about
the latest S&P action which is getting
boosted now by the
yet another blowout jobs report. I got a
lot of color commentary around that
which I'll save until we get to talk
about jobs specifically
but that's one of the things
that pushed markets higher on Friday.
So I
love to hear your thoughts on this but
let's talk for a second on the bull
side. You keep reminding me,
Adam, you're oftentimes too
bearish or a lot of the guests on this
channel are bearish. So what's the bull
story here? What's going to keep the
juggernaut going for the rest of this
year?
Well, it's not going to keep
going the way it's going for the rest of
this year. I just published an article
today
talking about presidential
market cycles and what happens
during that. And when we get into
June, July, August,
around there, I mean you need to expect
this market to correct by
10 percent-ish again. And again that's
kind of the same correction we had last
year but expect about a 10 percent pull
back here
before the election. And the reason is
simply, you know, just in normal history
markets kind of hedge a little bit of
risk going into the election because you
don't know who's going to win
for sure, right? I mean, you know,
incumbents usually win
when you have very strong economic
growth,
strong employees doing great, the
incumbent usually gets elected.
But, you know, you can't always
bank on that and
you don't know if the other person wins
maybe what type of policies you're going
to get or you're going to get tax hikes,
you can get
tax cuts, you just don't know. So there's
risk
going into a normal election and this
isn't anything but a normal election
this year.
You know, one of the outsized risks this
year is, you know, if
if, you know, one candidate gets elected
or the other, do we have
a bunch of social unrest, do we have a
bunch of rights, you know, whatever.
So there's even some outsized risk on
top of the normal risk
of the markets. So, you know, it was
interesting last night in the State of
Union Address,
you know, President Biden was talking
about
corporations need to pay their fair
share, going after
the health care sector because of the
high cost of drugs and
those type of issues. You know, none of
that's market positive. So,
you know, theoretically if he gets
elected and he's getting elected on the
Supremacy, he's going to hike the tax,
corporate tax rates, etc.,
that's not great for stocks. So, again,
you know, it's unlikely
that this current, you know, sprint in the
market is going to continue indefinitely
and particularly won't happen through
the end of this year. So you're going to
have a correction. You need to be aware
and ready for that at some point and
that's probably going to happen,
you know, within the next, you know, three
to four to five months.
Okay. I just wanted to note this stat
here and again I'm just trying to beat
the bull drum
just to see what we can get out of it
here.
With 98% of companies reported, S&P
500 Q4 gap earnings per share are up
22% over the prior year. This is the
fourth straight quarter of positive
year-over-year growth and the highest
growth rate since Q4 of 2021. So, you
know, there is earnings propelling the
growth here in the stock price. Now,
we can argue if the multiple that's
being put on those earnings is fair
but the E is actually increasing here.
Does that momentum make you feel like,
okay, I mean, you've said, "Hey, you think
there's going to be a 10% correction
at some point here," but does that
momentum lead you to think
maybe not in the near future? And, of
course, we can pull up your chart too and
look at the current
characteristics to see what's going on.
Yes, we've had very strong earnings
growth from quarter four of this year,
you know, quarter four of 2023 versus
2022.
And that's not surprising because in
2022 you had, you know, the economy was
slowing down, you had the fed hiking
rates, you had the market down 25%, 19%
had closed, but at one point we're down
25%.
So, you know, you had two very weak
quarters of growth. So,
again, when you're coming off of that
contraction in earnings, right, then you
have a boost in earnings because of
liquidity, the Inflation Reduction Act,
the CHIPS Act,
you know, all those type of things. Yeah,
you're going to have a fairly decent
expansion in earnings, which you saw.
Unfortunately, you know, that didn't occur
across the board. Not every company
experienced 22% earnings growth. It was
in a few companies,
primarily in the tech sector, that really
made up a big chunk of that earnings
growth.
For the rest of the market that was
growing at pretty much what you would
expect, which is normal kind of economic
growth rates, five, six, seven percent.
And that's where we're going to wind up
over the next year.
And this is this weekend's newsletter,
but we're talking about that over the
course of this year.
All the earnings growth expectation is
coming from seven stocks. The rest of the
market actually has flat to negative
earnings growth for the rest of this
year.
Earnings are tied to economic growth. So
if the economy is
slowing down, which it is, our rate of
growth is declining.
We're going from, you know, over nine
percent economic growth. We're down to
three and that's going to be sub, you
know, probably closer to two percent by
the time we get back to normality.
Economic growth, earnings can't outpace
economic growth long term. It will do
that coming out of recessionary spats or
recessionary downturns.
But once you get back into the growth
mode, earnings growth has to track the
economy.
Earnings growth will go back to growing
at three or four to five percent
somewhere there, depending on the sector
of the economy as well.
And that's also going to exacerbate once
all this
money that was shifted into the
industrial sector,
the basic material sector through the
Inflation Reduction Act.
Once those dollars start to come out of
the economy, earnings growth for those
companies will slow as well.
So again, that's just, you know, it's just
a function of that, you know, all we
created a whole bunch of artificial
demand through government spending.
And so once that government spending is
done, once we build the road or build the
building or whatever it's done,
then you're just whatever that
asset is going to produce. And so those
those rates of activity
are going to slow. Okay.
Well, getting to one more bullish note on
the stock that's been driving the
markets, Nvidia,
it's trading at like
$920 a share.
Time we're talking here, Lance, so
do you think that is now beginning to
feel the tractor beam
of the big large round number, the
thousand
milestone, so could sentiment just
carry Nvidia to that because folks want
it to be there and of course that'll
bring the market higher as that happens?
Well, yeah. I mean, you know, it's within
300,
like, sorry, it's within like 600 billion
market cap now of
being the largest company in the S&P.
So it's number three or number two right
now. So it's very close to being the
largest
company in the S&P. In fact, Mike and I
were just talking about that this
morning.
You know, if you take a look at the
sales for Microsoft, and I don't have the
numbers right in front of me, but
Microsoft sales revenue runs about 80
billion
and 88 billion, almost 90 billion and
Nvidia's revenue is about 30 billion and
yet
this company is right on its heels of
actually being larger than Microsoft.
So, you know, just, you know, and
after,
you know, it was also interesting right
after Nvidia reported earnings they were
trading at about 33 times sales.
They're now almost 40 times sales
because of this run-up.
So it doesn't matter how fast the
company can grow revenue.
The stock price is outpacing the revenue
growth. Yeah, and it's so funny because
I have talked about Nvidia's
price to sales ratio being crazy and
several times I've said like, "Yeah, it's
trading at 40 times sales,"
and then they release earnings and their
earnings and sales grow so much
that the price to sales ratio gets
whacked down,
but then the price goes up so much again
it goes back up to 40 times.
Yeah, exactly,
and again, look, there's a
definite outcome to this. I mean,
you know, you can't,
you physically can't grow earnings
at this pace forever, right? It's just,
it's a function of math.
You know, it's very interesting back in,
I did this tweet earlier this week, back
in 2000
Cisco traded with a 50 percent margin
and
they had 50 percent of the market share
at that time in routers and everybody
said, "Oh, the internet's the thing
and Cisco's going to dominate this
because, you know, the internet's going to
change the world
and everybody's got to have a router
and so,
you know, this growth rate for
Cisco's earnings is going to continue
indefinitely."
Well, it's been 23 years now and
investors are almost back to even on
Cisco.
Interestingly, Nvidia has a 75 percent
market share with a 75 percent margin
and people think that this is going to
continue indefinitely. Now, I'm not saying
that it's about to have this major crash,
but
what happened to Cisco is the same thing
that'll happen to Nvidia because
when you have this type of market that's
driving this much activity,
you're going to draw in other competition.
AMD is already
competing with it. I mean, you know, both
those positions in our portfolio are
up over well over 100 percent now since
we bought them.
But AMD's tracking Nvidia right now
because they're in the same space. So, if
Nvidia goes up, AMD goes up and
and that's just kind of the case in
point. So,
other players will come into this market
and there's more players coming to this
market. They're going to eat into that
market share. They're going to eat into
that revenue growth and there's really
smart people.
It's definitely in the profit margin, too.
Exactly. And look, there's really smart
people in China and
other countries that are
working on these same projects and
products and
somebody's going to come up with a
better tool
than Nvidia. You know, I don't know what
that could be, but at some point somebody
will come up with a better value than
Nvidia, right? Maybe not quite as good but
a lot cheaper, yeah.
Exactly. And that was my next point. Or
come up with a competitive product
that's cheaper
and all of a sudden you start losing
market share. And this is what happens
all the time. I mean, if you take a look
at
Cisco back then, yeah, Cisco in 2000, they
were the predominant provider
of internet routers. Now you can go to
the Walmart and you can pick up routers
from 50 different people
to go put in your house, right? I mean,
it's just, you know, they're just and
they're cheap.
And so the the issue is is that back
then routers were very expensive. Today
routers are a dime a dozen literally.
You can buy routers very cheaply, you
know, get one for 100 bucks
and do whatever you need to do in your
house. So, you know, that's going to
happen with all of this down the road. So
the ability for
Nvidia to grow earnings at the rate that
they're growing them will
end and that's
ultimately where the price will have to
start reflecting what the earnings
growth is going to be. And look,
we saw we've seen this happen with
companies, Palo Alto Networks, which we
bought recently.
They announced earnings and all they
said in their earnings announcement,
again, this was a stock that was trading
just like Nvidia going,
kind of just parabolic through the roof.
All they said was is, hey, we're going to
change our strategy for growth so we can
grow more aggressively in the future.
And the stock was down 26%. They killed
revenue. They killed estimates that, you
know, fundamentally companies doing great.
But they just said this one thing in
their earnings announcement, the stock
was down 26% the next day. So we bought
some on that dip.
Along with Nancy Pelosi, by the way.
Exactly. And so, yeah, well, we only
buy what Nancy buys. So she calls us,
tells us what she's buying. And then, you
know, we just, well, I mean, we joke, but
that would be the world's best strategy
up to now.
You can, I forget the ETF symbol.
There's an ETF that actually tracks your
trades. Yeah. Yeah. The guys at Unusual
Wales. Yeah. They published that. Yeah. So
anyway, but the point is, is that,
you know, that's going to happen. Nvidia
is going to come out and they're going
to announce earnings and go, hey, we grew
earnings at 100% this quarter. We just
knocked the cover off the ball, but we
think that next quarter we might be a
little bit, you know, our growth rate
won't be quite as good, right? Just, I
mean, it can be something just very
nebulous, right? You know, we, hey, we
potentially see a slowdown in activity
over the course of the next quarter. When
that happens, the stock will be down 50%
in a day. Yeah. That's, that's how much,
you know, enthusiasm is priced in stock.
Oh, look, this is a meme stock. It's
getting chased along with all the other
meme stocks. Meme stocks are back, by the
way. Bitcoin is back. And so you've got
all this speculative trading. I've
actually got an article coming out on
Tuesday about gold and Bitcoin, which has
now become speculative assets. There's a
very high correlation between gold,
Bitcoin and Nvidia over the court and
the S&P over the course of the last
three years. So, you know, if you
remember back in 2022, as the market sold
off, gold sold off with it, Bitcoin sold
off with it, as markets rally, those
assets all rally. So they've all been, so
we've, we've moved into a market where
we have a core, a theoretical
correlation of one across assets. So
just whatever's moving, we just throw
money at everything and drive those
prices higher. So, you know, when you've
got stocks that stocks or gold or
Bitcoin, it's trading at 75, 80 time, you
know, 75 and 80 on relative
strength, trading at four standard
deviations from their moving averages.
This is a great time to take profits and
start, you know, rethinking about
rebalancing your risk. All right.
Interesting. I can't wait to read that.
The gold part will be some interesting
post discussion on, because I've talked
to some folks recently who, I mean, when
the markets run, money does kind of
generally go everywhere, but, you know,
their argument is Bitcoin is, is largely,
well, gold is reflecting more
the liquidity and the destruction of
the purchasing power and Bitcoin to a
certain extent, but Bitcoin, they're
saying that's much more of a speculative
fervor versus what's happening in gold.
Wait, you know, that's the whole, that's
the whole thesis thing, right? I mean, I
can make that same thesis for Nvidia.
Nvidia is going to keep going up forever
because it now reflects the new future
of AI. So look, we all, when things are
going up in price, we always look for a
rationalization of why things are going
up in price, right? That's all, that's all
these stories are. So, yeah, everybody's
got an opinion. All I'm saying is from a
technical basis and what's going on in
the markets, things are mostly extended
and, and they are at levels where
previously you had very big corrections
in those prices. Now, that doesn't mean
they're going to crash. It doesn't mean
they're going back to zero. That doesn't
mean any of that. It just means that you
were going to get to a point where you
will see those assets correct by 20%, 30%,
40%, 50% again, and particularly in the
case of Bitcoin. But in gold, you can see
a 20% correction. In Nvidia, you can see
a 20% correction. In the markets, you're
going to see a 10% to 15% correction.
That's coming. It's just a function of
what triggers it.
Good. And we're getting to that because I
do have your recent post here that if
there's anything else you want to say
about it, about valuation metrics and
volatility, suggesting caution here on
the way you're talking about, well, I'll
let you expand on that. Yeah, all I wanted
to say is I'm looking forward for your
piece to come out so I can take that
correlation data to some of those folks
who were talking sort of trying to
parse their rationale so we can get our
answer to it because we're getting to
this very interesting point in the
market where smart people see things
differently. I find that interesting.
We're getting to the point in the market
where you as the eagle who tries to be
balanced is falling on the side of
"Yeah, this is really getting overextended."
And your point of corrections that could
be anywhere between 10% to 50%
is when you say the market could
correct by 10%, it probably will, but
there are players in there that are way
so far extended right now that they're
going to have potentially much larger
drawdowns. And real quick before you jump
off, there's also players in there
that have already corrected. And as a
good example, Apple and Google have had
very, very big corrections here lately.
They're very oversold. In fact, we'll
probably be adding to our positions that
we own in those companies. But what my
point about this is that we can see a
correction in the market of 10% and we
can see Nvidia go down by 20%, 25% and we
can see Apple and Google actually go up
in price. So there's also assets within
the market that have already corrected.
There are assets that are trading at
fair value. And so when you start looking
at your portfolio, and this is what we do,
is start looking for some of these out
of favor assets that money will likely
rotate to because money's not going to
leave the market. Money will rotate
within the market. So we're looking for
assets where those assets may, where
those monies may rotate to during a
correction. Well, and you know what's so
interesting about that. So of course,
that's the objective of the active
manager, is to find out where
better value is and get there. But as
the magnificent seven has been driving
the markets up over the past years,
you've said, "Hey, Apple is one of those
classic stocks where you can kind of
park yourself in because you're never
going to get fired for owning Apple.
It's so big, it doesn't really get waned
around that much." And it was one of the
beneficiaries, it has been one of the
beneficiaries of the positive net capital
flows that have been going, the passive
capital flows have been going into the
market. So with Apple at a lower price,
presumably it becomes a much more
attractive place to park money where
you're like, "I don't want to be out of
the market right now." But it's that big,
safe behemoth that has already sort of
pre-corrected to your point. Yeah, no,
absolutely. Look, it pays a dividend and
it's highly liquid. So as a
portfolio manager, if I'm like a
major hedge fund and I've got a hundred
million dollars that I need to park
somewhere, I can park it in Apple because
I can move a hundred million dollars in
and out of Apple in a day and it doesn't
move the price. But if I try to park it
in something like SCMI, the small cap
company that's making this magical leap
to large cap next week, I'm going to
move that price of the stock all over
the place. So as a portfolio manager or
a hedge fund manager, Apple, Microsoft,
Google, those are those safe haven plays
that I can put money into. Meta is the
same way. Okay. Presumably, I'm thinking
Tesla might not be as attractive to
you as a safe haven park right now.
Actually, we were just looking at --
Look, I'm not a big Tesla fan, so don't
get me wrong. I think Elon Musk is great.
I'm not a huge fan of EVs or
electric vehicles in total because
we're kind of looking at the trend of EV
cells. Those are starting to slow down a
bit. You take a look at what's happening
with companies like Albemarle that
produced lithium, that stock has been
decimated, and by the way, there's
another company that is starting to
become very compelling, but if you
take a look at what's happening in that
space, there's certainly some concerns
about the strength of EV cells going
forward versus hybrids and internal
combustion vehicles, particularly
because of cost. It does seem, this is a
deeper discussion for a deeper day, but
that the pendulum is swinging back to
hybrid now, right?
Absolutely, and then there's good reasons
for that, but that doesn't mean that
the demand for lithium or batteries are
going away because if you have a
plug-in hybrid, it's still got a battery,
so there's still going to be this
demand for batteries, and there's still
going to be a demand for electric
vehicles, but Tesla does a lot of other
stuff as well, so it's still
expensive, but it's given up a lot of
that overvaluation, and it's not
there yet, but this is a company that's
starting to trade at much closer to
reasonable valuations for a company that
deals a lot in technology. So, again, I'm
not recommending buying Tesla, and I'm not
recommending buying Albemarle, so don't go
out and buy this stuff because it's not
ready yet, but I'm just saying there are
areas that, again, are becoming a lot more
compelling, and as far as a place to park
money, Tesla has corrected a lot
of that overvaluation. It is big, it is
liquid, and so as a hedge fund manager, I
might be interested in using Tesla as a
parking spot, no pun intended, or using
Tesla as a vehicle to basically park
money in the environment. Now,
again, that would be one of my last
choices. You pick an Apple or a
Google before that. First, Meta,
particularly now that those are all
paying dividends, but, sorry, not
Google, but Meta is now paying a dividend
as well, so those would be my first
choices, but I wouldn't necessarily count
Tesla out. I think there could be an
interesting rally coming up for Tesla.
Okay, one last thing on sort of the
bullish side of the ledger. This is very
specific to one stock, but I believe it's
one that you own. Eli Lilly,
there's now headlines coming out that
demand for its weight loss product
may be exceeding supply or it's
getting in danger of exceeding supply,
so that thing could continue having
upward pressure on it. You've
ridden that stock, right? Yeah, no,
we own Eli Lilly. We're actually hoping
for a correction because we want to
add more to the position, but the whole
GLP-1 issues, which is this magical
weight loss drug, it's been around
forever. They used it for diabetes for a
long time, and then they figured out
that it also helps with losing weight,
so it's becoming a much more
mainstream type topic, and you're
starting to see a lot more people
talking about it. You're starting to see
a lot more people take it, and it's
interesting now because people are
going, "Oh, well, this is going to really
impact grocery stores because
they're not going to sell as many
groceries," and those type of things.
It's an interesting stretch to say that
because I know people that are on the
drug and have used it, and the thing is
that you don't use this forever. You
use this for a period of time, you lose
weight, and hopefully, as you're losing
weight, you're supposed to be changing
your dietary and your behaviors.
Unfortunately, that's not how it works
in most cases because, again, this isn't
a drug that helps you do these
other things. If you don't
work out and if you don't exercise, you
don't take walks every day, those type of
things. That's not part of your lifestyle.
If you still eat the same crap food, just
less of it. It's still crap nutrition.
Exactly, but this drug's not going to
make you become an exerciser.
It makes you feel terrible. That's why
you don't eat, and then once you
kind of get over being sick, you'll eat a
little bit, but that's how this drug
works, and it just makes you not want to
eat. That's not necessarily, "Hey, that's
not a great way to be healthy," and, yes,
it's helping you lose weight, but it's not
a healthy way to lose weight.
Well, one of the questions I have about
it, and this is just pure speculation, so
I've got nothing to say about this, but
presumably, the drug went through all the
testing it needed to do beforehand, but
you're running this national experiment
right now where we haven't had people
take the drug like this for this purpose
for a long period of time, so I'm just
wondering if, in a couple years, we may
be talking about the immense amount of
lawsuits that are dragging Eli Lilly's
stock down because they found out that
this thing does something horrible to
you when you take it for too long.
What do you mean like running a national
experience, a national experiment on a
vaccine, and now...
Yeah, let's not go there.
No, it's actually very interesting because
they were protected from lawsuits and now
they're trying to pass a bill to open
those companies up to lawsuits, so that's
going to be a huge issue for companies
like Pfizer, Moderna, etc. If they become
liable for lawsuits, that could be a
massive impact to earnings.
Yeah, oh, well, absolutely. Do you have
any sense of where that effort is? Is it
still just in discussion stage or...?
Yeah, no, it's still in discussion stage
at this moment. I mean, they're trying to
build support for it, but there's enough
evidence out there of people that have
gotten damaged from the vaccine that is
becoming... it's putting a lot more
pressure.
Yeah, I mean, what would you expect? I
mean, forget the specific vaccines, just
just any brand new pharmaceutical that
was rushed to market like that and you
deployed to millions of people. And I
mean, I think they're... I can't remember
which brand it is, but they're... or the
CDC is recommending what, the eighth or
the tenth, you know, so like, you know,
if you have this many repeated exposures
to something that was rushed through
trial, shouldn't be surprised that
they're going to be issues with it, no
matter what it is.
Yeah, exactly. But I mean, I think that's
something that if you're... if you're long
companies like Fai, I'm not saying... again,
I'm not recommending that you sell
anything today, but I think that's
something you need to really keep a
watch on because that could amount to
billions of dollars of lawsuits if that
liability protection gets overturned.
That's the risk, right? The risk is the
overturning of liability protection. If
that occurs, you know, you probably don't
want to be along those stocks.
Okay. All right. Well, I want to move on
and from the vaccine topic, folks,
definitely try not to take any
particular public position.
I don't care whether you took it or not.
That's all on you.
Oh, I'm just saying it's such a sensitive
topic. I don't want the comment section
to become, you know, about the vaccines.
And I understand and appreciate people's
strong feelings on it. But to your point
about risks to watch out for, again, back
to your recent piece, valuation metrics
and volatility suggest investor caution.
This is sort of the basis of what you
were saying about, hey, we're at a point
where a 10% correction kind of makes
sense. Don't know exactly when it's going
to happen, but expect it before the
election. Anything else you want to say
about the current state of the market?
Well, I mean, you know, look, valuations
are expensive, no matter how you want to
slice them. If you take a look across
metrics, whether it's trailing PE, forward
PE, I mean, you're just paying a lot to
own equities. You know, and this always
goes back to, you know, the big disconnect
between investors and what they think and
what they do. Right. You know, in theory,
if you're overpaying for an asset of
anything, your future return is not going
to be high. If you pay $100,000 for
point of Corolla, you're not going to
resell it for $100,000. Right. You're
probably going to lose money on that
deal because you overpaid for it. Same
thing with overpaying for a house. If you
overpay for a house, odds are you're
going to sell it for less money in the
future. That's just the way, that's the
way valuations work. And, you know, it's
always very fascinating to me that as
individuals, you know, on any other asset,
no matter what it is, you go online to
Amazon and you want to buy a new gadget
for your kitchen and you'll shop through
50 different suppliers that gadgets, he's
going to give you the best price. And
then, you know, you'll shop on Google, you
know, look for the best price on the deal
or you'll go to eBay and try to
negotiate a deal. You know, it's our
Facebook marketplace, you know, whatever
it is, we're all looking to get a deal on
something. You won't overpay for a car.
You go to a dealership, you try to
negotiate down the price of the car. But
when it comes to stocks, you'll just pay
whatever because it's going up in price.
And there's a very long historical
correlation between what you pay for
assets and what your future returns are.
But, you know, and here's the, here's the
important part about this, though.
Valuations are an absolutely terrible
market timing device. So you should never
use any type of analysis for managing
your portfolio short term that has
anything to do with valuations. So you
should never look at valuations as any
part of your metric for short term
management. Then I want to say short
term, 12, 18 months valuations mean
nothing. It's all about psychology. In
fact, like this chart shows, if you look
at consumer confidence, this is our
consumer confidence composite. So it
looks at both the University of Michigan
as well as the conference board's
measures of confidence and overlay that
on valuations, surprise, there's a
correlation. It's correlated. Yeah. Yeah.
And the reason is, is that as people
feel more optimistic, they go buy stocks,
stocks are going up in price, so they
feel better. So they become more
optimistic. So they go buy more in
stocks. When that, when, when those, you
know, stock prices stop going up, well,
confidence, you know, tends to go with
it because they have less money and they
lose money in the future. But the bottom
line is, is that over the next 10 years,
your returns are going to be probably
close to zero. And really, if you look
back over the last two years, yes,
markets are doing great since November.
But, you know, markets are up about
8, 10% from where they were two years
ago. So, you know, we, it took two years
to get to even. Now you've made 8% on
your money. So, you know, that's, you
know, and now if we, if we turn around
and give that all up this year, we back
to even, and then, you know, next year
the market goes down. We have a recession
eventually, whatever market goes lower.
Then you rally back, get all back to
even, then you look back over 10 years
and go, wow, I didn't make any money.
Yeah. I just want to note too, there's
just that chart, very similar to ones
that we've shared on this program of
late from John Hussman, very similar
scattered chart like that. So, you know,
when, when smart analysts do their own
work, but come to the same conclusion,
that's when you really want to pay
attention. Right. And so this is another
measure though. This is, you know, this,
and this article was kind of based a
little bit on Warren Buffett who just
issued out his annual letter and he made
some very interesting comments that, you
know, he can't deploy his 160 billion in
cash because there's nothing to buy. That
A is large enough to move the needle, but
B is reasonably priced. Right. And so if
you think this is the inflation, so I, I
do a Buffett's indicator a little bit
differently. I've inflation adjusted. So
my numbers are a little bit different
than, than the actual kind of mainstream
media version. But because you think
you're smarter than Warren Buffett,
right? That's why. Well, yeah, exactly.
But you know, anyway, but no, I mean,
I just inflation adjust valuations and
market cap for, for what's going on. So
this is inflation adjusted market cap to
GDP ratio versus the real S&P 500 index.
So inflation adjusted S&P. So if you
take a look at that, you know, we're
trading at two times the value of the
economy. So what is market cap to GDP
mean, right? Why is that important? Well,
again, a con you know, stocks companies
generate the revenue from the economy.
So just from that very metric stock
should not be more highly valued than
the economy because that's what
generates their earnings, right? It's
what you and I do in the economy. It's
our activity that generates sales. So in
theory, whenever the market trades above
the value of the economy, in other words,
a ratio of greater than one that's
typically been at market peaks. And
again, back to 73 74, we traded at 1.4
times market cap to GDP that led to the
crash of 74 dotcom crash at two 12
financial crisis at one 55. We were two
61 during the run up into the pandemic.
And so now we're at two after the
correction in 2022. And again, we're
starting to work our way kind of up. So
as the economy slows down, if markets
keep going up, that ratio is going to
start to go up very dramatically again,
kind of like we saw back in 2020. But
just like everything else, if we take
that and spin it out and look at market
cap to GDP in terms of future forward
returns and the real S&P 500, that dot in
the upper right hand corner where it
says 2022 correction, that was the
peak of the market in early 2022. So
that's how far you were outside of the
norm of market cap to the S&P. We're
currently very elevated again at two
times. And if we take a look at it on a
forward return basis, you know, we're
looking at forward returns of somewhere
around a negative 3% based on this
indicator using real market cap to GDP.
So again, it's just no matter how you
kind of measure valuations, you're just
overpaying for assets to such a degree
that ultimately your future returns are
going to be disappointing. And here's
here's one other thing about this. I've
written articles about this previously.
We've spent 43 trillion dollars in the
economy since 2009, and that has boosted
the average annual return of the market
to 12%. Now that boost of 4% or that
boost of 12% average annualized rates
return is four percentage points higher
than the 8% that we generated from 1900
to 2008. So all this money that we
dumped in, TAMP, HARP, HAMP, all these
different things that we did, you name
it, and then QE programs, etc., created
a 50% higher rate of return than the
long term average. So that if we just
return back to normal and go back to
eight, that's going to feel really
disappointing compared to what people
were getting. But now we're talking
about potentially rates of return
somewhere between 3% to a negative 3%
over the course of a decade to 20 years,
and that's going to be very
disappointing for investors that are
used to seeing the speculative market
that we've seen over the last decade.
So let me ask you this then. So you
said don't use valuation to make
decisions that are a quarter or two out,
right? They take more than 18 months to
really play out, but by your own
calculations, you're currently looking
at numbers that, from what you just
described, they're like, "Wow, it might
be kind of rough the next couple years
as a capital allocator." Well, no, again,
over 10 to 20 years, right? That's going
to be the rest of your career. Well,
yeah. Well, thanks. I was hoping.
But here's the problem with this,
right? That's what valuations tell us.
It doesn't tell us what the market will
do during that period. This is the
important point. This doesn't mean,
and this is very important, what I just
said does not mean that the market is
going to generate 2% to 3% every single
year. You're going to have years where
the market's up 10% or 20%, and we want
to participate in that. Then you're
going to have years where the markets
are down 10% or 20% or more, could be a
30%, could be a 40% correction. Then
you're going to have the next three or
four, five years where the market's
going to go up 10% or 15% a year, and
it's going to be awesome. But when you
go back and average all that year, if
you bought the S&P today, in theory, and
10 years from now, it'll be the same
price, right? But in between, it had
huge rallies.
Right. It won't be a flat table.
Yeah, totally good.
Right. Yeah. It's going to be all over
the place. That's why using valuations,
though, is terrible for managing your
money. But what it does tell us is that
the markets are taking on, and investors
are taking on way too much risk, and
they're not going to realize when the
markets are turning that it's time to
get out. So they're going to wind up
doing what they always do. They're going
to buy high. Markets are going to
correct. You'll have a 15%, 20% correction.
They're going to sell low, and then
markets are going to run up again.
They'll buy high, and they'll sell low.
When they look back over time, they'll
have lost money. I just wrote an article
just the other, just Monday, I think, or
Tuesday of this week, talking about
retail investors. They're still negative.
They lost so much. They lost so much
more money during 2022. The market was
down 19% return, including dividends on
an inflation adjusted basis in 2022.
Average retail investor was down 35.
Market's back to all new highs, and
retail investors aren't. But that's
because investors do all the wrong
things with managing their portfolio.
Right, and I was going to ask you
something else, but now you triggered
me here. So that's honestly one of the
very main reasons why helpful money
exists is because the retail investor
is not as sophisticated as the
professionals, and I'm painting with a
very broad brush here and present
company excluded for all the viewers
watching this channel, but they're
much more sort of emotion driven, herd
driven. Oh, the people around me are
getting rich on Nvidia. I better get in.
And what that does is it generally
compels them to make the worst decision
at the worst time or at least bad
decisions at bad times. And they tend to
take injuries that on a percentage basis
that tend to be much worse than the
professionals take. And many of these
people can afford to take those losses
a lot less than the average
professional. So it's just it's super
important to me to try to help regular
people understand the nature of the game
where things are so that they're not
falling victim to their less
sophisticated and more emotionally
driven ways and that they can benefit
from guys like you, Lance, who are just
sharing with us what a thoughtful
capital manager looks at. Yeah. And again,
but this is all that psychological
issue that we fall prey to. And it's
just when markets are going up, it's the
fear of missing out. We've got to get in.
And then this was really interesting.
It was so fascinating to me during 2022
because the markets were going up in
2020, 2021. Remember, we were doing
IPOs and SPACs and Wall Street couldn't
issue enough product for people to jump
into. And of course, all the Reddit
traders were buying Bitcoin. And every
speculative asset, they could get their
hands on AMC and GameStop. We had all
those conversations. And it was so
interesting to me because in 2022, as
the market's correcting, everybody was
like, oh my gosh, we're about to have
this major bear market. It's all going
to crash. But yet we never developed any
fear in the markets. As the markets were
coming down, I was getting swamped with
emails like, is this the bottom? Is it
time to buy? Not only did we have FOMO
of missing out on the way up, we had the
FOMO of missing the bottom on the way
down. And so everybody kept buying. And
this is why the market kept rallying.
We'd have these sell-offs. The market
would rally a whole bunch. Then the
market would sell off and rally a whole
bunch because everybody was trying to
find the bottom to buy. And so finally,
the market bottomed in 2022. And we've
had this huge rally ever since. And I've
got a really interesting report coming
out looking at the bank reserves versus
the market. And there's a very neat
correlation, a 66% correlation between
bank reserves and financial markets. And
bank reserves bottomed in October of
2022 and have been rising ever since
along with the market. So it's just
very interesting because we see all this
money getting pulled back into assets.
And you see this massive surge in
psychology. And so I have this kind of
measure. And I can't take credit for
this measure myself. But CinemaTrader
tracks what we call dumb money, smart
money. And so I've recreated that index
of dumb money investors. And at peaks
of markets, that's where dumb money is
just piling in. That's the retail
investor. And the reason they're called
dumb money is because Wall Street is
liquidating assets. They're selling
their assets to the retail investor.
What's been going on this year?
Institutions have been selling hand
over fist this year as retail investors
are buying everything they get their
hands on. So it's just very interesting.
We're right back into the same type of
story. And when you take a look at the
dumb money, less smart money
allocations, that's the blue, you know,
that generally occurs right at peaks.
And right now you've got, you know,
retail investors, your average retail
investor. This is the American
Association of Retail Investors. Their
asset allocations are basically where
market peaks have been. They have very
low allocations to cash. Remember all
that money on the sideline theory?
There's no money on the sideline. It's
all invested. And it's all in the
markets. And, you know, and this is just
kind of that whole thing that we've got
into. You know, we're chasing, you know,
everything from the lows. The S&P is
outperforming everything is outperforming
mid cap, small cap, you name it. There's
nothing beating the S&P except the Nasdaq
right now. And if you take a look at
measures of, you know, kind of exuberance
and speculative risk taking, whether it's
options or retail flows, they're all just
pegging the roof. You know, interest and
call options are spiking sharply. You've
got the largest weekly inflows into
small cap stocks, which are your most
speculative side of that kind of
investment cycle in stocks. And, you know,
the flows into small cap growth are
outpacing everything else at this point.
So again, investors are just absolutely
taking on the most risk possible. And
they're taking it in companies where 40
percent of the Russell 2000 have negative
earnings growth. So, you know, it's just a
disregard for any type of valuations or
anything else, but it's just how fast can
I get money
invested into the market so I can get
rich quick.
Alright, so those are great charts,
by the way, and folks, if you're
listening on a podcast, you really should
take the time to come watch this on
YouTube and see those charts. So, Lance,
those clearly look like late stage
rally or late stage peak signals,
right? It sounds like the patsy has
shown up at the poker table. Wall
Street is, you know,
institutions are dumping as much as they
can on the arrival of the retail
investor.
So it seems to me that you're saying
you're getting down to maybe like,
you know, Def Con 2 on like this is
going to have to correct, folks, right?
What are you watching on the
micro side to give you a sense,
that will give you a sense of like, okay,
corrections now imminent, right? Because
right now I hear you saying it's going
to correct, but it could be anytime
between now and the election.
What are some signs where you're going
to be like, okay, wait a minute. This
looks like things could be rolling over
real soon. I want to really start
getting the safety.
You're not going to know that.
You know, that's the whole problem is
that, you know, we've been talking about
it correctly saying, hey, we've been
saying for the last month that,
you know, we are set for a correction of
10%, 5 to 10% this year.
But for a month, the market just keeps
going up. And so, you know, naturally
everybody's like, I, you know, he doesn't
know what he's talking about. This market
is just going to go up forever. And I
love Twitter because Twitter is awesome.
Like, because it's just, you know, it's
such a great sentiment gauge. I can put
out something that suggests the market's
overbought. It's like, oh, you know, you
know, just BTFD and just, you know, buy
stocks. It's all going up from here. It's
never going down again. And that's a
great contrarian indicator. But no,
you're not going to know in advance of
when- Let me give you an example,
because look, I know there's no
guarantees, right? But I'm just like,
let's say in video or another
continued super high flyer
disappoints on its profit growth or
its revenue growth, right? Would that be
an indication of like, okay, wait a
minute, like
the price for perfection driver of the
market all of a sudden just stumbled?
Right. But basically, you know, this goes
back to why we spend so much time, you
know, looking and analyzing technicals
importantly in the market. And
what I'm trying to say to you is that
you're not going to know
before the correction occurs. That's my
point. And so you're going to lose
three, two, three, four percent off the top
of the market
before you're going to have an
indication that says I need to become
a lot more aggressive about hedging risk.
Now, I would recommend hedging risk now.
And by saying that is if you've got, you
know, positions that have done really
well and you've got, you know, big profits
in them, take some profits. That doesn't
mean sell everything. That means if the
position is normally three percent of
your portfolio and it's now four, you
trim it back to three. So you just do
some housekeeping your portfolio, raise
a little bit of cash, rebalance risk,
rebalance your portfolio.
But when this market has been running
along the 20-day moving average, all the
computer algorithms in Wall Street right
now are watching that 20-day moving
average because every time we get down
to the 20-day moving average, the market,
the buying programs kick out,
kick in and the market goes up. Earlier
this week, Monday, Tuesday, market sold
off, hit the 20-day moving average. We've
been up every day since.
And this has been going on for the last
five months now. So, you know, that 20-day
moving average is very critical because
if the market breaks that 20-day moving
average,
closes below it and then fails to get
back above it in the next two days,
the algorithms are going to switch
from buying to selling and they'll start
selling the market there and then you'll
immediately hit the 50-day moving
average, which is currently right around
49.06.
If you fail there, your likely test is
going to be the 200-day moving average
at 45.50.
So, you know, you're talking that's about
your 10% correction.
Okay, all right. Which by the way,
which by the way, and I did this
analysis on our program yesterday,
but if we go back in history just real
quick to this time last year,
we were having exactly the same thing
going on. We had the market running along
the 20-day moving average. It was all
about AI. We just had the Silicon Valley
bank crisis back early in March
and then that quickly bypassed with the
bank term funding program
and it was all about AI. We had this AI
chase going into
April, May, June, July. The market was up 17%
for the year going into July. Starting in
June, we were talking about a correction.
Hey, we're going to get this 10%
correction five to ten percent. You and I
discussed it repeatedly. It just didn't
happen. Markets were overbought. They
stayed overbought
and then finally summer came along and
we had that 10% correction.
That's what's going to happen but you'll
notice that that correction didn't ensue
until we took out
that kind of running support line
and that's where we are right now. We've
got this nice running, very trending
support, nothing to worry about in this
market right now
until we take that out. Okay, thanks and
this is exactly what I was asking for.
I know, you just want to shut up long
enough to let me explain.
Just to point out for folks here,
if the S&P drops below the 20-day
moving average and it doesn't bounce, it
punctures below,
that will be a sign for you to say, "Hey, I
got to really start
getting serious about looking for
for ways to de-risk."
I know you're saying start de-risking
now but that would probably
accelerate your efforts, I imagine?
Oh yeah, once we start getting a
real sign that
we're beginning a bigger correction,
yeah, we'll start reducing our overall
equity exposure, adding a short to the
portfolio, doing whatever.
We're also at these two shaded areas
in the portfolio.
So this is what's called a cup and
handle formation
and so we had this big decline in 2022.
We rallied, we had this correction
and going into October of last year
and that was the kind of the formation
of the handle. So if you kind of look, it
looks like a cup and a handle.
That's a very bullish formation. So when
you break out of that
formation, you typically get a
move that's
measured from the
breakout
of that cup and handle formation, which
would put
this move that we're in right now
targeted around 5,200. So we're at 5,150.
We're real close to what the targeted
move
of a cup and handle breakout would do
and that's actually still bullish, right?
So we get a correction back
towards these previous highs around 4,800
or even this
this high that we had back in
July of last year. Find support there.
That would also be the 200-day moving
average. Very bullish market supports
there,
bounces off that, then you get a
continuation of the bull trend.
But you need to have at some point a
retest of that breakout support level
and a retest of the 200-day moving
average would be the best.
And then if we can hold that, then that
would correct a lot of this overbought
condition
and give you a lot better opportunity to
put money to work.
Got it. Looking at the RSI there
where we see that wedge building there,
wedges like that tend to get to a
breakout point,
either up or down. I'm guessing
you're thinking it's probably more
likely down given all the things that we
just talked about,
but no guarantee, right? But I guess my
guess is would you expect that wedge to
to have a breakout point in either
direction?
Well, if it breaks out to the upside,
there's not a lot of upside to go,
right? So that might mean that maybe the
market gets to 5,300, maybe 5,400, which is
kind of our target for the year.
So logically, it's going to
break to the down. It could break to the
upside first
and then break down, but probably, and the
whole point of this is that you have a
market that's strongly rising, but you
have a negative divergence in both
momentum as well as relative strength.
So the MACDs, you have a negative
divergence in the MACDs.
They're just slowly trending lower.
You're losing momentum in the market.
You've got this kind of negative
divergence that's building. The slope, the
downward slope in RSI,
the relative strength of the market is
declining. So you have this what's called
negative divergences, which
are contra-indicators
to a bull trend in the market. It
suggests that the market is going to
break lower
at some point. We just haven't got there.
Again, we go back, we talk about we have
ultra-low volatility right now.
There's basically
the volatility index trading extremely
low levels,
lots of speculation in terms of call
options. So you have all the
ingredients for a very sharp reversal in
the markets at some point. It's just a
function of what triggers it.
Okay. Well, so speaking of potential
triggers,
your partner, Michael Leibowitz, recently
put out a report titled "Liquidity
Problems Are Closer Than You Think."
Let me just read a part
of it and then I'll let you run on it.
He said,
basically in the piece he talks about
liquidity that is leaving the
market right now or at least becoming
more scarce.
So he says, "So what type of problems
occur when the excess liquidity is gone?"
We've had all this excess
liquidity that's been put in and it is
beginning to
contract. For starters, banks
will still have to use their reserves
financial system to the Fed and the
Treasury. Without the reverse repo
will likely be felt at that point
because right now they've sort of been
drowned out
by the excess liquidity that's been out
there.
So how big
of an issue do you think this could be
in the rest of the year?
Fairly significant. This is what I was
just talking about earlier. I'm just
starting to work on this article but
I'll just share a couple of charts with
you real quick.
So this is overnight repurchase
agreements and that blue line you can
see is declining rather sharply and
that's going to head back towards
zero at some point and that's the big
concern right now.
What happens here is that when
you have a big expansion and reverse
repo like we had in 2020 as an example
you have a big surge in bank reserves.
That's been tailoring off and
you can see that since kind of this
bottom that we put in October
of '22, last year bank reserves have been
on the rise.
So what's important about
this is that if we go back and this
is what I'm saying is that there's a
very high correlation but
between, oops what happened here, that's
not what I want,
yeah there's a little one, there's a very
high correlation
between bank reserves and so this is
the cumulative weekly change of bank
reserves versus the S&P. It's got about a
66% correlation.
So you know if bank reserves
start reducing because of what's
happening with the tightening of
liquidity
that's going to, and again like my
friend Mike said, you know
banks loan money into the financial
market so they
they work with hedge funds, they work
with their own prop desk, they provide
the margin, they provide all that stuff.
So if liquidity begins to get
extracted because of reduction in bank
reserves
by in theory if the correlation holds we
should see a correction in the financial
markets
which would be just like we saw in,
go away, you know back here at the peak
of the market in 2021,
bank reserves started contracting in 2022
and we had a correction in the financial
markets. So
you know that's kind of the
risk that we're running in terms of
a contraction in liquidity.
Alright, and if I can just sort of add
on to this, so I just interviewed Michael
Howell
this week. He's Mr. Liquidity that
basically liquidity is everything
and he continued his
predictions that net liquidity will
continue rising
through the remainder of 2025.
So he's still pretty bullish on
the markets
but he did say two things that were
somewhat cautionary. He said one,
we're at the point where we've seen
probably 60% or more of the gains that
we would expect from this bull market, so
he's like
making more gains from here is going to
it's going to be harder.
And secondly he said, and it's not going
to be a straight line up, and he said
Q2, he's looking at Q2 and saying yeah
with
the draining of the reverse repo program
and the expiration of the BFTP and a few
other things that are going on, he's
just saying look yeah that could be kind
of a pretty volatile period. So
he didn't make any hard predictions but
basically gave the impression that like
hey,
I wouldn't be surprised at all if there
was a material correction. He didn't
say 10% but you're 10%
and so even real bullish
guys like him
are looking at the liquidity situation
in the next quarter or so and saying it
could get a little dicey.
Yeah and look I mean the correlation
with the bank reserves in the market
that's
when that
the repo program gets drained then
that's going to take, that'll
take a couple more months and
that's what I'm saying. Don't go
panic now and sell stuff because
things are fine. And again,
let's keep bells in line. We're talking
about a five to ten percent correction.
We have five to ten percent corrections
every year. So there's nothing
outside the realm of normality of having
a correction.
I really want one. I would love a
correction back to the 200-day moving
average
because that would reversalize overbought
condition,
get valuations down a little bit, smidge,
but provide us a lot better opportunity
to put capital to work at better prices.
I mean there's,
we own a lot of great companies that I
would love to add to if I could just
get, they're just
have been running parabolic and just, you
know, I can't justify buying them at two
and three standard deviations above
their means.
So you know, I need things to correct so
I can put some more capital to work.
Great. I'm just curious, would you
mind just sharing one company that if it
if it came down into your
acceptable valuation range you'd love to
buy right now?
Costco,
Walmart. Okay. I'd buy both of them.
I'd buy,
you know, every time Costco dips and it
doesn't dip often,
but you know that's a company that just
prints money. The memberships at
Costco
are phenomenal. People pay,
I mean, it just, you pay 119, 120 bucks,
whatever the,
and the memberships keep going up every
year.
But that's just free money. You pay this
money for a membership to go shop
at a grocery store and buy stuff at a
profit margin that they also make.
And yeah, you can't buy a hot dog and a
Coke for a dollar fifty but,
and it's a really good hot dog and a
Coke. But you know,
that's just cash flow that just, it has
no cost to it to have that membership.
And so they just
literally print money. And so yeah, if
you can ever buy a Costco,
add the Walmart on discounts,
you buy those in your portfolio and
don't touch them.
All right, great. I appreciate you
sharing that. All right, so we spent a
lot of time talking about stocks. Let's
move over to bonds for a moment. So
bonds prices have been rising.
Ten-year yield I think is down to what,
about 4.1
right now or so. So
what are your, what's RIA's current view
on bonds and
where things are heading there? Nothing
changed.
You know, things don't operate
overnight.
You know, yields are a function of
economic growth and inflation.
Inflation will continue to work its way
back down towards two percent.
Economic growth will work its way down
towards two percent. Yields will follow
suit. So
as we've just said repeatedly, it's, you
know, this is a long-term game. This is,
you know, 18, 24, 36 months.
You know, and inflation is being a little
bit sticky right now. So we've got to get
through this period. So that's going to
keep inflation a little bit,
keep yields a little elevated at the
moment, but once we get through this
period and start the next kind of leg
down lower in inflation,
it'll follow suit.
Okay. Yeah, and by the way, if the Fed
starts cutting rates like the hinted at
yesterday, that's also another big
downward pressure on yields.
Right, yeah.
It's going to be
super interesting to see what the Fed
does here and I'm sure we'll talk about
that in a little bit.
If we get the 10% correction in the
equity markets that you're expecting,
what would you expect bonds to do during
that period? Would they catch a safety
trade bid or would they be?
Yeah, the
yields should do well because if we're
getting a correction, you'll have a risk
off momentum trade.
Okay, all right, but again, most
importantly, you've said, hey, in terms of
RIA and the strategies that we've shared
previously on this program in terms of
your bonds outlook, you're not
changing anything.
Yeah, no, and this is always interesting
to me because, you know, I get every time
yields tick up, you know, a tenth or
whatever in one direction or the other,
like, you know, are you doing anything?
What are you doing different with bonds?
Because yields ticked up on this and, you
know, this employment report or whatever
is like
nothing and, you know, this isn't a
function of what happens from one day
to the next. We're not trading bonds. We
have a long-term thesis in bonds and
portfolios and we're collecting a coupon
while we're sitting here waiting for
the price appreciation to work, so
there's nothing to do. You just have to
be patient and let economic
fundamentals work for you.
All right, great. Yeah,
we did not get into bonds much last week
and I got a bunch of questions saying,
"Hey, what's going on?" Nothing's happened.
It's like, look, bonds are like watching
paint dry,
right, or grass. Actually, a better one is
grass because it doesn't take that long
for paint to dry.
You know, this is like planting seeds of
grass. You got to wait a while for it to
grow, so just
be patient, people. Okay, all right. Well,
we talked briefly about jobs earlier.
I want to get your reaction to the
recent jobs report. I've got a bunch of
different charts here I'll try to pull
up while we're talking.
Another blowout jobs report and it's
business as usual,
right? We tout how amazing
the latest
payrolls were, so this was a print of
275,000 versus expectations of
200,000, but then, of course, at the
same time they're announcing this
amazing beat, they're saying, "Oh, well,
remember last year,
last month's crazy beat?" Well, we're
actually dramatically revising that
downward, so
folks might remember that last month
really caught folks by surprise. It was a
whopping 353,000
jobs. That's been revised down by 35%
to just 229,000 jobs, which is still
a decent jobs market.
But a 35% correction, it takes a
complete outlier and puts it into the
average.
So we're continuing to see
the alligator jaws between the
household
report, the household survey, and the
establishment survey continue to widen.
I'll maybe pull that chart up while I
let you react here, Lance, but
it just seems like
it's sort of more of the same like
it seems more like a window dressing
exercise than it does actually like a
report on an economic data set.
Well, it is. Okay, so first of all, don't
forget this is an election year,
and yeah, every month we're revising down
the previous month and so
that's the way this game
works, but the markets don't pay
attention to revisions.
And we'll come back in a year and
we'll probably knock
the payrolls down by another
30% or 40%
by the time we get there because it'll
eventually align with the household
survey. So the question is either the
household survey is going to catch up
or the BLS is going to catch down, one of
the two.
But there's a lot of anomalies that are
going on in this data.
The leading economic
indicators is a good one too,
and also consumer confidence. I love
consumer confidence. They've been
revising that one
every month for the last several months.
So, you know, they come out and they say,
how do you feel about the economy? Ah, I
feel great, but you said that last month.
Yeah, I didn't feel that good last month.
So
I changed my mind on how I felt last
month. Yeah, you know, and so
there's so much, you know, and those
things shouldn't change. I mean,
your opinion last month and your opinion
this month shouldn't change. There should
be no revisions to that data, but there's
constantly
these revisions. And again, this is the
problem with
surveys and all these other things that
you manipulate because you do manipulate
them. You know, you, you know, doing
seasonal adjustments. That's a
manipulation
of the data. That's not the real data.
You're manipulating the data
for an outcome. And then, yes, we can all
come up with reasons why we need to do
this. We have a lot of layoffs in
January because of the holiday shopping,
but you really don't need to. As we said
before, if you just use the 12-month
average of the data,
solves all your problems, and you just
use the actual data, put a 12-month
average on it,
and you're good. And you get the same
results, ultimately,
but you get a better, more reliable
result by doing that. So,
you know, again, we're going to come back
and revise all this data.
You know, and by the way, we've had this
gap in the household survey before, and
they magically revised that number, and
the gap goes away.
So, you know, this, that's, that's what I'm
saying. We don't pay attention to these
revisions,
but down the road, a year from now, and
three years from now, we'll revise all
this data, and then we'll look,
you and I will be sitting here, maybe,
talking about, did you see what they
did? Do you remember that massive jobs
report we had back in
2023? Yeah, well, we were actually all
losing jobs.
It was all phantom, yeah. Yeah, and, but
no, but market won't care by the end. The
economy doesn't care by the end. Whose
over in office doesn't care by the end. So,
you know, it's, it's,
you know, we have to go with the data we
have, because that's what drives the
markets. We can analyze it and piece it
all day long,
but at the end of the day, the market only
cares about what the report is.
Yeah, so, you know, I,
I have, I have largely looked at this
as smoke and mirrors,
right? That this was sort of intentional
to just try to
keep everything looking rosy, and then, as
you said, later on, we'll revise it, and by
that time, the market will have moved on,
doesn't care, right?
Yeah, I still think there's a lot of that
going on, but I interviewed
consumer researcher Nili Taminga this
week,
and she actually is in pretty close
contact with the folks at the BLS,
and what she thinks is likely
going on is that
we deformed the job market data so much
during COVID, where we fired tens of
millions of people,
and then had to rush to hire them back,
that we basically
broke the models. So, it's sort of the
bullwhip effect, where there's just
big massive, you know, waves of
adjustments that are rippling through
the BLS models,
to the point where they're, until that
equilibrates, they're just not useful.
Like, you still print them, they take
their best guess,
but it's really not useful because the
data has been so agitated, right?
Well, it was interesting, in the State
of the Union address last night,
President Biden was touting the fact
that they created 15 million jobs,
strongest amount of job growth of any
president ever,
and that's a true number, but the
problem is that
a vast majority of those jobs were just
basically hiring people back that you
fired.
You're adding them back, yeah, exactly.
So, the real job, so we have
to net out
all those rehires to get what the real
job growth was, which would be much more
in line with norms, and then again, you
know, there's been definitely job growth
and job creation,
no doubt about that, but it's certainly
not the strongest ever in history
because
of this, and to the BLS's, and to your
interviews point,
is that that massive firing
of jobs and the rehiring of those people
to come back
have completely blown those models
out the window.
All right, I'm looking for a data point
that I thought I had a link to, but I
guess I don't.
So, an important development of this most
recent payrolls report is that the
unemployment rate
bumped up to 3.9 percent, right, jumped
up from 3.7 to 3.9 percent,
and that's notable because even
with all these, you know, great beats and
great data,
you know, unemployment's beginning to
move,
one of the things that the
chart I can't find
is it's a chart of initial claims versus
warn notices,
and if you look at it, initial claims are
still pretty,
they're very low and they're
very flat, they really haven't moved very
much,
where warn notices over the past like
eight months or so
have been moving high and to the right
at a 45-degree angle.
So, you know, companies are out
there basically letting their employees
know that they're going to, that their
layoffs coming,
right, and of course we've seen layoffs,
actual layoffs
jump pretty dramatically so far in 2024,
but there's this real disconnect right
now between the official data, like
the claims, right, and what we can see
employers actually doing, which is
announcing layoffs,
warning their employees through the
Warn Act and whatnot, and I was asking
Neely actually about this,
and she said, yeah, you know,
it's coming, right, like we're, you know,
unemployment's going to start moving here
as those warn notices started turning
into actual layoffs,
and she said one of the things that's
that's been delaying all this
has been the length of severances
that were getting paid out were much
longer
than what were previously offered, right,
people were getting, you know, in certain
cases six months or more
severance payments and, you know, that was
definitely very prevalent in the tech
layoffs in 2022.
What's interesting about that is she's
saying, you know, she gets reports
from companies about
what type of severance programs they're
offering, and she's like, wow, there were
companies that were doing multiple
months that are now doing, like, you get
your two weeks and that's it, right,
so the length of those severance and the
generosity of those severance packages
is really coming down now,
so basically all this is her saying, like,
we're getting close to the point where
the impact of these layoffs is not going
to be masked anymore and we're going to
start really seeing that reflected in
the data,
and who knows what's going to happen
from here. I just want to note that
when you look at
a chart of the U3 unemployment rate,
which is the main one that gets
reported in the media,
when we go into layoffs,
that unemployment rate, it's, you know,
stable, stable, stable, stable, and then
it spikes going into recession, like, once
it starts moving, it starts moving
really fast.
Are we at that stage yet? Are we getting
close to it? Who knows, but it's
important to note that it's finally
beginning to move
up and almost break into a forehandle
where it's been so muted for so long.
Yeah, and that's,
and that's, this is, so while you were
talking, I was just recreating
a chart that I haven't updated it
today, so I apologize. This is my actual
spreadsheet,
so forgive the other garbage that's
around it. Maybe we get to see how the
sausage is made. It's great. Yeah, exactly.
So this is full-time employees relative
to the working age population, and
you and I mentioned this last month when
you and I were talking because
there was a very interesting issue last
month, be that we had this massive drop
in the population. We had, we lost 450,
451,000 people were just magically
extracted from the population last month,
and so I was curious if the drop in the
full-time employment to population ratio
was a function of just
that decline in the working age
population.
This month, there was a, the, the
population growth kind of returned to
normal, so we added 171,000 people
to the working age population this past
month, and yet
the full-time employees relative to the
working age population dropped again, so
we're now down to 49.66 percent of the
population.
We never, and so this, this goes back to
what I was saying, you know, the,
Biden last night during the State of
Union was touting his very strong
economic
employment growth, best ever on record,
yet the number of people working
full-time relative to working age
population
never even got back to the pre-COVID
peak and has now declined from that, as
we talked about last month.
Normally when you see declines like this,
that this, that, that are this sharp
is usually heading into a much more
severe economic slowdown. The reason is,
is obvious that as, you know, I need a
full-time job
to, you know, raise a family and pay for
a mortgage and get health care benefits
and all that, so if I'm losing full-time
employment relative to the population,
that's going to translate into weaker
economic growth at some point in the
future. So,
you know, it's interesting. I thought
maybe last month was an anomaly because
of that
reason that we just lost 500,000 people,
but we've added people back to the role
and,
you know, still have reduced numbers
going down.
Yeah, that's a much more
relevant number now.
Wow, all right. I'm going to steal the
screen share back
to show this chart, which is
the correlation between
the
private non-farm payrolls
and the NFIB small business hiring plans
index.
Yeah, so you can see it's a pretty tight
correlation
and we've got more advanced data for the
the business hiring plans and they've
just dropped like a rock
basically since the end of last year and
now, so if that correlation still holds,
well, payroll should follow suit. Yeah, and
again, look, you know, small businesses
we, you know, we just wrote about this
last week or week before last,
we talked about the NFIB, its
relation to small cap stocks in
particular is a very high correlation
between the NFIB
confidence index and small cap stocks
and again, this is what I was talking
about
and that was one of the charts we
included in that article about retail
speculators.
But, you know, small businesses make up
50%
of the employment in the economy and
and they are very sensitive to changes
and spending by consumers.
So if demand slows even a bit, they're
going to cut back on capex plans, they're
going to cut back on employment plans,
which is exactly what we're seeing them
do right now anyway.
Wow, okay, so I've
got a long list of stuff we still have
yet to talk about, we're beginning to
run out of time, so I'm jettisoning
stuff out of the balloon here, but
around consumer spending.
So, you know,
increasingly I keep seeing more and more
both data and anecdotal reaction to
consumers about
the cost of living around
specifically around food.
And there was a TikTok video I just
saw, I was trying to
see if I could get it in here and I
couldn't find it this morning,
but it was a dad who went shopping for
his
family of four, he bought basically
ingredients for two dinners
and he was like, look, I actually, with
the exception of the tomato sauce,
you know, for the pasta,
which I just, I'm a quality nut on the
tomato sauce,
you know, everything else was basically
the lowest version that I could buy.
He said, how much do you think this cost?
And it was something like 160 bucks
and he was like, I can't do that, like I'm
trying to make
the cheapest meal I can for my
family of, you know, what we're eating
here and it wasn't, it was, again, it was
some sort of pasta-based disc, it wasn't
like caviar, right?
And he was just like, I don't know what
to do, like, I don't know how I'm
going to, he's like, I actually do okay
relative to most of the people I know in
terms of income wise, but he's like,
this is really stretching me and I don't
know how the regular person's, you know,
going to be able to do this. So I want to
combine that with
the fire that's going on right now in
your state in Texas,
right? Largest wildfire in Texas history,
it's in the part of the panhandle where
I think
something like 10 million cattle are
there,
which is a huge part of the cattle
production, the beef production for
the country.
They don't know how much cattle has been
killed yet, but it's not going to be
immaterial and before the fires hit,
what was this,
the US cattle herd was the
smallest it had been since 1951
and similarly up in Canada, their cattle
herd is the smallest in 30 years.
So, you know, that's obviously not going
to help for food price inflation for
anybody that wants to eat beef-related
protein, right? So
when I was talking to Neely, you know,
she was actually saying, "Look, I actually
think like economically,
looking at the consumer and all the
different types of consumers, she's like,
"I think we're going to muddle through,"
she said, "unless two things happen."
She said, "Unless the over-leveraged
consumers really starts tapping out
and then if the maturity wall,
like if the Fed doesn't ride to the
rescue in time and the maturity wall
hits the over-leveraged corporate fleet
hard and they have to start." So either
the over-leveraged consumer
reduces their spending,
which an over-leveraged population,
she put it was like 20 to 30 million
Americans fall into her over-leveraged
segment and/or, you know,
the more over-indebted companies have
to start firing people because
their debt is re-rated, right? And it's
kind of thing like, "Look, I mean, unless
rates come down sometime real soon,
I can see pretty decent probability of
either of those things happening."
So I'm just curious from the things that
you look at, how concerned are you
about what you were talking about, which
is consumer spending starts,
you know, getting crimped because
consumers are just saying, "Yeah,
it's getting hard to even put food on the
table." Yeah, no, I mean, I think that's
the real risk.
You know, I'm not too worried about,
you know, the credit side.
If you think a little what's going on
with small cap companies right now in
particular, small and mid caps,
they're refinancing debt using
collateralized loans,
so, you know, leverage kind of leverage
loan obligations.
So they're able to, you know, they're
taking on a lot more risk by doing it,
they're able to get some of that debt
refinance. So we've seen a big
a big surge in that kind of debt
offering over the over the recent
last several months. So we're seeing
some of that refinancing activity occur.
There's absolutely, you know, we've said
before, if you really want to, if you're
concerned about
a major market event, all you got to do
is pay attention to credit spreads.
There is no risk in credit spreads right
now. There is,
the credit market is pricing in no
event
of significance. That's why we may have a
five to ten percent correction this year,
but you're not going to see a 30, 40, 50
percent correction,
at least not now, because the credit
markets are not pricing in any
such event. And they will. They're very
sensitive to fundamentals.
So, you know, pay attention to credit
spreads. That's your biggest friend in
terms of managing money.
When it comes to the economy, though,
that's a little different story that we
could see. You know, I still think we're
going to see a much more significant
economic slowdown over the next 12, 18,
24 months. Again,
you know, the GDP declining back towards
sub two percent,
inflation coming down more sharply, and
that'll be a function of consumers
literally
tapping out, so to speak. Because, again,
you know, when you have food making up
30 percent of discretionary incomes,
it's just getting onerous. And I agree
with, you know,
you know, that point of view, which is
even my wife and I, we kind of, we make
good money.
And, you know, it's just,
we just kind of don't go out to eat
anymore because I just, you know,
I like going out with her, you
know, having a date with my wife and
going out. That's kind of our
time together,
but it's just getting so expensive and
the quality of the food sucks.
Yeah, it gets so ruined when the bill
comes, and then you're like, "What?" And then
they say, "Oh, and, you know, do you want to
pay a 25 percent or 30 percent?"
Yeah, well, like we had a date, so I took
her out on a date. She had a really hard
day at work, and so I took her out on a
date,
and we went to this restaurant. It's a
pretty nice restaurant, and it has a nice
atmosphere. It's nice decor,
and we've been going there for years, and
we don't go very often. I mean,
we do that type of dinner maybe once a
quarter,
so it's not something we do on a regular
basis, so we don't go to this restaurant
all the time,
but we have been to this restaurant
before, and
normally when we go, you know, you know,
we both eat fairly healthy, so
I had ordered, you know, this dinner
that was a grilled chicken breast, and it
came with a salad and came with a side of
rice and black beans. I know it sounds
boring for most people, but that's what I
eat,
but normally the chicken breast is
probably, you know, eight to ten ounces.
It's a good healthy size
chicken breast, right, and I like
going to this one restaurant in
particular. I'm not going to name the
name,
but I like going there because
their portions were always
well, you know, well designed that, you
know, it was always a nice piece of
chicken and,
you know, very juicy, very tender, and so
when I got my plate this time, I think it
was a quail.
Or maybe a dove,
because this was the smallest chicken
breast I've ever seen, and yet it cost me
about 30 percent more than what we used
to pay.
Shrinkulation. Well, it is, and it's
exactly that, and, you know, but my point
is, is that, and to your point, it kind of
ruined the whole dinner at that point,
and, you know, and we, and both my wife and
I just kind of looked at it as like, yeah,
we're not going to do this again.
We'll, you know, because we
enjoy cooking at home, you know, our
thing is just to spend time together.
She works, I work, she works very long
hours, she travels a lot,
so when we're together, we want to spend
time together. We enjoy cooking
together, and so
we've just decided that we're just going
to spend more time just cooking at home,
and,
you know, and having our dates that way,
and it's not like these dinners are a
big offset for our incomes, because again,
we make decent money,
but it's just spending that money, and
then,
and then, and then they want 20, 25 percent
tips on top of it.
Right, right, it just ruins them. Yeah, it's
getting ridiculous,
and, you know, and I even had this
conversation, to your point, I had this
conversation is that
I don't know how people that make
average American incomes are making it.
I, you know, and I just don't see, and I
will tell you this,
I have noticed in the last couple of
months in particular that,
like if I have a lunch meeting with a
client or whatever,
that restaurants are not
nearly as busy as they used to be.
Yeah, I'm hearing anecdotally and even
seeing some myself that,
that the,
whatever you want to call it, the revenge
spending, or just the,
you know, okay, whenever I would, I don't
oftentimes go to a mall, or but when I
certainly would go to the airport, and
I'd be like, how come there's no parking
spots here? Okay,
you know, we were coming out of this, you
know, economic
shutdown, and, and, you know, there was a
shock to the world economy, but like, oh
my god, everybody's going on vacation,
right?
Yeah, I'm taking my daughter on spring
break next week, and
four years ago when my older daughter
was
graduating high school, we made the same
trip,
and prices and availability are notably
better
at the destination now than they were
back then.
Yeah, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be on
spring break next week too, so.
Oh, enjoy my friend. I know you, you very
kindly offered to take a bullet and
still record this with me, so thank you,
and I will, I will repay the favor when
I'm on my trip.
It's just a funny story on this topic
too. Last night,
my daughter and I, our weekly ritual is
we, we go to
pub trivia every Thursday night, so we
went last night,
and, you know, she asked if she could get
a
sandwich, and I said, sure, you know, gave
her my card, so I don't know if you
remember
the story I told about the 35 dollar
BLT
in my town, so she went, she got her
sandwich, she gave me the card, I go home,
and I get the little receipt on my phone,
and I was like,
what? 30 what? And I looked, and she went
to that same place,
got a different sandwich, but I was like,
son of a...
I mean, how you can justify a sandwich
that costs over 30 bucks when all is
said and done
is freaking ridiculous. It's obscene.
All right, so
had a pretty good rant for this week,
which we'll, we'll push off to next week,
because
I know you gotta leave in just a couple
minutes, Lance, and I gotta get to my
wrapping up,
general wrapping up. What I, what I will
say, just for
human interest here, is
we've talked in the past about the
benefits of hanging, of dead hanging, and
we've talked about this channel. I'll tell
you, I probably
get more random tweets and emails from
people about that topic, saying,
I, thank you so much, I had no clue about
it, and I'd had shoulder problems for
years, and I started hanging, and oh my
god, within the first week, it started
going away, you know, and a lot of, a lot
of lifetime converts
now, apparently, to dead hanging, which is
great. I'm so happy to help people there.
I'm in the process of learning a
new,
I think, what will be sort of in a
similar
class as that, in terms of just health
benefits, but it's a lot harder to do,
and this is the cold plunge. So,
this week, I've been thinking about it
for a long time. I've heard folks like
Andrew Huberman
extoll the benefits of it. Problem is, I
hate the cold.
I grew up in New England. I did my time
there, right? I still think it's too cold
for me here in Northern California,
so to intentionally walk into
water that's like 50 degrees or
colder is super not pleasant, and it is
the absolute last thing my brain wants
to do,
and it's miserable. I'm not gonna
lie. The first 40 seconds are absolutely
miserable,
but having now done it a couple of
times, I get it.
I get it. The way your body feels
afterwards, it's like a
flushed feeling that you enjoy
really for the rest of the day, and
there's a whole litany of health
benefits that you're supposed to get
from it,
one of which that I'm already kind of
beginning to see is
it really helps reduce inflammation,
so if you have joint pain or
if you've got
sort of chronic issues with parts of
your body, it'll oftentimes reduce the
inflammation
low enough to let the blood flow in
there and really
accelerate the healing, so anyways, more
about this. I'll maybe
take a quick little video of it and put
it up on the screen next time so folks
can just see how
how miserable it is, but folks, if I can
do it, if it's something you've been
thinking about,
you can do it, and you only have to be in
there for, they say, just a minute to
three minutes to get the benefits. In
fact, I say if you stay longer,
a lot of people's ego get involved, and
so they're like, "I'm going to try to go
for eight minutes or ten minutes."
They say you really don't get much
additional benefit for that additional
pain, so
while it is miserable, it's relatively
quick, but anyways, that's something you'd
ever think about doing?
Oh, no, and for me, it's
always been the issue of just
I'm always short on time,
so I go run or whatever I'm
going to do and then
to get the bathtub filled up, get the
ice transported in, the whole
nine yards to the coal plant, it just
takes too much time.
So I take cold showers,
and again, it's not the
same effect, but you do get the same
negative effect, which is
shrinkflation.
It's shrinkage, Jerry, it's shrinkage!
Like a frightened turtle, right?
And also remind me, I have a rant that
we need to, we need an educational rant
next week, if you can make a note about
the difference between a constitutional
republic and a democracy.
Okay, and just for the record, folks,
spoiler alert is we have the former.
Yeah, just because you're hearing
a lot of this in the media right now
about threats to democracy and all this
with the election coming up,
I think it's just very important
to understand the value of
what a constitutional
republic is versus a democracy,
which is mob rule,
why we have an electoral college and why
it's important
and why we have the House of
Representatives and the Senate the way
it's set up. I mean, these are all very,
you know, apparently a lot of
people in the media have not taken a
civics class.
It's just as we're getting ready to go
in an election and you're going to go
cast a vote,
you should at least understand what
you're voting for. Right, especially
too, as
emotions get whipped up, the
closer we get, you want to be thinking
logically about the structure of how
our political system is
supposed to work, or at least our form of
governance is supposed to work.
Okay, I've written it down.
Trades, very importantly, before we lose
you.
None this week. None this week has just
been, you know, this market just keeps
grinding higher
and, you know, at this moment where
we're pretty fully allocated
and, you know, again, it's just, you know,
our big debate right now
is, you know, we should trim these stocks
back, you know, just, you know,
they're, you know,
have had great runs, we should sell them,
but if we start doing that, we start
impeding performance in a market that
just kind of keeps grinding higher. So
this is what I was saying earlier is
that you can take some, we've done some
profit taking, we've done some
rebalancing,
but we're now to the point that if we do
any more or we start hedging, we're going
to start impairing performance in the
portfolio
relative to our benchmark. So we've got
to be a little bit cautious here and
this is what I was saying is that
we're watching that 20-day moving
average very closely. If we break that,
violate it, confirm it,
then we'll start reducing equity because
at that point we will have the market
telling us what to do rather than
guessing at it.
Alright, well look, we'll start
wrapping up here. Folks, if you enjoy
these weekly market recaps even more
than we enjoy our constitutional
republic,
let Lance know by hitting the like
button and then clicking on the red
subscribe button below as well as that
little bell icon right next to it.
Just a last reminder about the
conference, you've only got a week left
to sign up for it so do it now if you
haven't yet.
Sadly, the early bird price is behind us
no matter what Lance said.
Sadly, there will be no Ginsu knives
along with it as well
but you will get over nine hours of
incredibly
dense financially nutritious
content with many of the best experts
ever to come on this channel.
So to sign up for that, go to
thoughtfulmoney.com/conference
and then as we say every week,
Lance has done a really good job this
one from his eagle point of view saying
correction risk is getting
higher and higher, the longer the market
continues its current trajectory.
So he's ringing a bell of caution.
Again, not crash tomorrow and not sell
everything but he's ringing a note of
caution and most folks who are trying to
navigate this, especially if we're all
retail investors mostly watching this,
which we would be called the dumb money.
I don't want you to be the dumb money.
So make sure you don't become the
dumb money and in most cases
your best chances of that are going to
be working with a good professional
financial advisor who can be guiding you
here through this process. If you've got
a good one who takes into account all
the issues that Lance and I talk about
here and is doing that for you, great,
but if you don't have one or would like
a second opinion from one who does,
consider scheduling a free consultation
with one of the financial advisors that
Thoughtful Money endorses, perhaps even
Lance and his team there at Real
Investment Advice to do that. Just go to
ThoughtfulMoney.com, fill out the short
form there, only takes a couple of
seconds and as a reminder these
consultations, they're completely
personalized to your specific situation,
they are totally free, there's no
commitment to work with these guys, it's
just a free public service that they
offer to help as many people as possible
navigate what's coming as prudently as
possible. Lance, as usual my friend, I'm
going to give you the last word here.
That's it. I'm good. I'll see you next
Friday after spring break. Have a good
one. Alright, that's all folks.
You're just going to be the porky pig
ending here? Yeah, that's it. That's all
folks. Alright, well buddy, thanks so much
again. Another great week. Enjoy your time
off with your spring break next week.
Thanks again for coming on on Friday to
record this with me then and everybody
else, hope you enjoyed this. Thanks so
much for watching.
