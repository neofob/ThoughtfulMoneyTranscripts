Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. One of the asset classes I get the most requests to do an
interview on is farmland. It's a form of real estate investment that yields cash flow by producing commodities. All attractive qualities
to investors worried about inflation and or the loss of purchasing power of fiat currencies. But how does it perform versus other asset
classes? And how does one invest in farmland without being forced to become a farmer oneself? For answers, we're fortunate to talk today
with Craig Wishner, managing director of Farmland LP, which manages over 15,000 acres, farming them sustainably at scale. Craig, thanks
so much for joining us today. Great to see you, Adam. Hey, great to see you, Craig. I've interviewed you many, many times over the years.
I should get this out right at the beginning. Full disclosure, I'm an investor in your first and second fund that Farmland LP has put
together. But you are definitely an expert on farmland. You've done a great job sort of demystifying it for viewers in the past on previous
companies that I've been involved with. But now that we've got a new one, Thoughtful Money, I wanted to do sort of a reset for our viewers
here, given how many requests I get to get a farmland expert on. And hopefully you can help people understand this asset class, why it might
make sense to have it in your portfolio, and then very importantly, how they can get access to it because it's not nearly as easy in most cases
as just hopping onto your discount brokerage and buying a stock. So anyways, I've got a lot of questions here for you. Right before we turn
the camera on, you unveiled a presentation. Looks like you've actually anticipated most of my questions. So maybe to dive into the sort of
why invest in farmland and the benefits of farmland and all that, maybe I can just sort of let you run with your presentation. And then once
you're done with the slides, if I've got any unanswered questions, we can talk about them then.
That sounds great. Yeah, it's great to see you. And congratulations, you just keep getting better and better on this. We've been doing this,
we started about the same time, it was about 15 years ago that I started Farmland LP. Around that time, you started doing this, and it's just
phenomenal what you built and the kind of value that you're providing to your audience here. And so what I want to do is just put together
some basic slides to give people a real picture about farmland as an asset class and why it's interesting and how it works and how
investors can access it as well. Give kind of a landscape on that. So we'll dive in and feel free to ask any questions along the way.
Will do. I'm never shy about that. Excellent. We will be talking today about, again, Farmland as an Asset class. I'm Craig
Wishner. I founded Farmland LP about 15 years ago. We are one of the 14 largest farmland managers in the US, and we're the largest
focused on organic and regenerative agriculture. And we have a 10-person fund management team. We have a 45-person farm management
team as well. We manage over 15,000 acres. We lease out two-thirds of that farmland, and we farm ourselves about a third of that
farmland. So we're really kind of active practitioners on the farmland. We're active farmland managers, and so we really focus on
adding value to farmland. And I'm just starting this really just to give you background about how we got into the space and why we're
experts in the space. What we set out to prove when we started 15 years ago was that we could add value to farmland by
converting it to organic. And we've demonstrated that we can buy farmland that generates commodity rents of $300 an acre, take it
through a three-year organic conversion process, and then get rents of $750 an acre. So we add value in a lot of other ways.
Sorry, just before you move on there, just to make sure folks get this kind of the key competitive advantage differential of what you
guys do versus a traditional conventional farmer is you come in, buy this conventional farmland that's often been monocropped, and it's
getting $300 an acre, I guess, on average here, you're saying, and then after you bring it up to organic status, you're now getting
more than twice that an acre on average. And I know there's other things you're doing with permanent crops and other things where you
have an even higher return, but that's kind of the basic almost arbitrage of your business model, right?
That's right. Basically, the value of farmland is based on the value of the crops that you grow on that land. So if you can increase
the value of those crops, you'll increase the profit for the farmer and increase the returns to the landowner as well.
Great.
And organic is one way to do that.
So let's talk a little bit about kind of in general, why invest in farmland?
The demand for farmland exceeds the supply. Fundamentally, that the need for food is permanent and growing just as simply as
population expanding as well as people wanting higher quality food or more dense food on that.
The amount of farmland is shrinking. The value of farmland, actually the financial performance of farmland as an asset class
outperforms other asset classes over decades. So the financials are very strong in an investment portfolio.
It beats inflation over time and well-managed farmland can deliver an impact, a positive impact on the environment,
on the food that you eat and really create our general mission is actually to create a sustainable presence for humanity
and agriculture. So you can really make a positive, bigger difference here.
Oh, that's a pretty good mission. Real quick. Oh, you're going to answer it right here. So go to your next slide.
It looks like I did hear you right. You said that U.S. cropland acreage is shrinking.
That perked at my ears. Why?
Well, you know, it's funny, we categorize farmland as commercial real estate, and this is the only form of commercial real estate
that when the other forms of real estate grow, they're usually shrinking farmland as an asset class.
So when that new Wal-Mart goes in or that new apartment building goes in or that new office complex goes in,
usually it's built right on top of great farmland. So I got it.
All right. So it's development and it's sort of the commercial real estate industry almost sort of eating its own tail.
Right. It's the buildings encroaching into the farmland acreage.
And there's also loss due to water issues, soil degradation and other things.
But really, you have what this slide actually speaks to is that the amount of farmland that we have in the world and in the United States is finite.
And as land is finite, so as it's used for other purposes, the amount of acres declines.
And on the other hand, people seem to like making babies and population continues to grow.
And in general, kind of a rule of thumb is it takes about one acre to feed one person, the average American diet.
And so for the history of the United States, we've had just an absolute abundance of farmland.
And but we're getting to a point where that's kind of changing.
In fact, you see that kind of the crop acres are kind of flat over the past kind of couple decades.
That's because we're we're still actually losing farmland, but we're taking land out of conservation and putting it into production.
So kind of eating our environmental seed corn on that.
And so we're kind of reducing the resiliency of society while the population continues to grow.
The farm of blakers are going to decline.
And at some point, we're going to reach that crossover point where the U.S. may go from a food exporting nation to needing to be a food importing nation.
Now, there's a problem with that because most of the rest of the world is food importing nations.
And pretty soon you're going to have too many people at the trough on that.
But, you know, that's kind of a long term issue about why we really like farmland as an asset class to invest in.
The value of of high quality farmland will only continue to go up due to these basic supply demand issues.
Interesting. And just for the folks that are listening on a podcast and can't see the chart here.
You've got the U.S. crop acres that are flat to trending downwards and the U.S. population just continuing grinding higher.
We're getting close to the crossover point where one acre feeds one person or we've got one person per acre.
So our acreage per capita is shrinking pretty fast here.
That's not good for all the reasons you mentioned. I'm curious. This is U.S. data you have on this slide.
If we were to do this worldwide, would the trends look the same or worse?
Because there's a lot more population growth outside the U.S. than not.
And I don't get the sense that crop acres are growing tremendously globally.
But you tell me.
No, there's not not a lot of additional crop acres available and the population is growing now.
The growth of the population globally is kind of slowing down a little bit from some of the higher numbers that we thought we would get to in the past.
Whether it's 11 or 13 billion. Now it looks to be like maybe topping out around nine to 10 billion people on the planet.
But those same people are also going from a low quality diet or a low density diet to a higher density diet.
The first thing that happens as societies get wealthier is that they switch from a vegetable and grain diet, primarily grain driven diet to meat diet.
And meat requires three to 15 times the amount of grain per pound of calorie in that meat.
So it's not an efficient way to convert calories to the diet, but it is more valuable.
One of the ways that you kind of get around it from just a pure starvation standpoint is just eat less meat.
So am I worried about kind of near term starvation? No, I am worried that there are issues in terms of total food production.
OK, so the key takeaway from this chart, though, is that crop acres on a per capita basis are becoming more valuable.
And that presumably this is a tailwind that's going to continue in the industry for the foreseeable future.
It's not like you think this is a short term trend or see it reversing anytime soon.
This is the dominant macro trend that drives the long term need for farmland as an asset class over the coming decades and centuries.
Farmland will not get less.
As long as people continue to eat and as long as people continue to make babies, farmland will not become less valuable.
OK. All right. Pretty good investment thesis. All right. Yeah, I'm willing to bank on those two things.
So now let's talk about the macro side of it. Let's talk about the overall economic value of this.
Now, I mentioned that we talk about farmland as commercial real estate because it's very comparable, actually.
So there's three point eight trillion dollars worth of farmland in the US. That's about the same economic value as all of the apartment buildings in the US or all of the office buildings in the US.
And so farmland is commercial real estate, just like those other asset classes.
And about 40 percent of farmland is leased as well. So it's driven by rental income. That's why it's commercial real estate.
There are some very interesting things about farmland. The first is just its leverage, whereas apartment buildings are 51 percent leveraged.
Office buildings around 78 percent leveraged as an industry.
There's only 13 percent debt on the farmland sector. So farmland is really not correlated with the debt markets.
If there's a big if there are big issues in the debt markets, you're not going to have a whole bunch of farmers being forced to sell their farmland and drive down prices like you see in some of the other forms of commercial real estate.
But another interesting thing about farmland is that only two percent of farmland is institutionally owned, about 50 billion dollars worth.
So really, there's a tremendous opportunity for institutional ownership.
A lot of the issues with agriculture are not based on institutional ownership.
In fact, kind of if you look at at the ownership of farmland, about 40 percent of farmland is leased and the remainder is is owner operated on that.
So, you know, we see the biggest opportunities in land that used to be owned by farmers, but now it's been passed down two or three generations.
Those people live in the cities now. They're not farmers. They just lease the land out to other commodity farmers.
And there's a lot of deferred maintenance. There's no incentive for the owner or the farmer to invest in things like organic conversion or permanent crops.
And so really, it becomes this kind of underutilized asset that we can go in, acquire and then really add value and improve.
Great. So for a fund like yours that has over the past 15 years really figured out their model, optimized their operations and whatnot,
it sounds like there's good opportunity for you to acquire more acreage that is being sort of underutilized under that manages efficiently and bring those efficiencies into the newly acquired acreage.
Is that true? That's right. So at least, you know, 40 percent of a three point eight trillion dollar market.
So we have a little bit of ways we can. I was going to say that that's it's still pretty big.
Yeah. We're at about two hundred and seventy five million today. So we have we have ways to go before I start to worry.
So if you look at it's just kind of as a pure financial asset as well, how does it do compared to other investment asset classes?
And so the first chart here shows that farmland and this is the NCREIF index.
The if you look up NCREIF farmland index, you'll see it's an institutional essentially measure its way for institutions to measure their own financial performance of this asset class.
A lot of this, the farmland that is institutionally owned is actually privately held with pensions, things like that.
And so over the decades, actually, since 1995, Farmland has delivered around eleven point two percent annualized return with very low volatility.
It's beaten actually other forms of commercial real estate with lower volatility as well.
And the S&P five, it's even beaten the S&P 500 with much less volatility on that as well.
So Farmland really performs similar to a bond in terms of its volatility, but has market beating financial performance.
You can kind of see that as you can see that as you look at this at the second chart here, the orange line there is this NCREIF farmland index.
You see the commercial real estate index right next to it again. This is NCREIF.
And one thing to point out is that in 2008, you see this pretty large drop for the commercial real estate.
That's because of the debt issues that the other forms of commercial real estate were having a big drop off.
But Farmland really just kept going and is not correlated with other forms of commercial real estate.
It's also not correlated with the stock market. So the S&P 500 is next to it.
Certainly S&P 500 beats Farmland over short periods of time, but S&P 500 also has some substantial downturns as well.
And so Farmland to us really represents this kind of long term, slow and steady tortoise that wins the race.
Yeah. And what's interesting about this is, I mean, you look at this Farmland index line here and there really aren't many, if any, visible drawdowns.
You know, it's either kind of flat or it goes up. And over time, the tortoise wins the race versus everybody else.
And I was going to ask you, so I'm glad you put this chart up. How has it fared over the past two years, you know, as 2022 came around
and basically walloped almost every other asset class? Here it seems like it did pretty well, actually.
The last couple of years have been average across Farmland, kind of six, five to seven percent annual returns.
And you have some sectors, some subsectors that are doing better than that and some sectors that are doing a little bit worse than that,
closer to flat or so. But you really don't have substantial downturns in the sector. Certainly not over time.
So it gives you attractive long term average returns without a lot of downside risk.
And it's got that non-correlation to the other asset classes. So it provides that nice ballast to a portfolio from a diversification standpoint.
Exactly. I actually, before I started Farmland LP 15 years ago, I was doing venture capital and private equity.
And when I had grown up doing commercial real estate, I spent 10 summers growing up on a farm,
but then did the business world and venture capital and private equity for a long time. And when I really understood Farmland and the financial return profile of Farmland,
it was almost unethical for me to keep going in venture capital and private equity because you have these vintage periods where you're just delivering zeros,
like losses for people, not actually like zero, like flat financial performance for some years. But in venture capital, you can have some real negative years.
Farmland just keeps going over time. It's a wonderful asset class that people are underexposed to.
All right. I love that term. It was almost unethical not to invest in it.
So I also wanted to share a little bit with inflation as well. Farmland benefits from and exceeds inflation.
And just to give the headline, over the decades, Farmland beats inflation by about 6.2% over time.
And it beats other asset classes. So you really have this great performance versus inflation over the long haul.
And here's why. As inflation, one of the key measures of inflation is food getting more expensive, right?
Eggs are up. Food prices are up. People say, wow, there's significant inflation.
Well, again, the value of Farmland is based on the value of the crops that are grown on that land.
So as food prices go up, the value of the crops grown per acre increases as well.
So the farmers are making more money and the investors are making more money as well.
So that's why Farmland is positively correlated with inflation.
Or in addition, you have yield increases as well per acre, as seeds get better, as machinery gets better,
as inputs get better, drip irrigation, things like that, technological advances.
All right. So I just want to zero in on this for a second.
So there's a lot of economic reasons to own Farmland and we've already talked about a few of them.
But we have a number of people watching this program who prioritize preservation of purchasing power.
And so we have people that are fans of precious metals for that reason.
We have people that are fans of Bitcoin for that reason.
I think you would say if that's why you're buying gold and Bitcoin is to try to protect the purchasing power of at least part of your wealth.
Well, gosh, you should really think about putting Farmland in there as well, because it has the same properties.
In fact, it seems to have superior properties in terms of staying ahead of inflation.
I agree with that analysis very much. Personally, I love gold. I think it's great as a diversified asset.
I also love Bitcoin. I was mining Bitcoin since it was a dollar. That's a longer story.
But I have about one percent of one percent in gold, two percent or so in Bitcoin. But people like Bill Gates have a much more larger percentage in Farmland, obviously.
But people like Bill Gates have five to seven percent of their wealth in Farmland as well.
So I do think it's actually a superior asset class in terms of building out an allocation if you're worried about things like purchase price parity and things like that.
OK. All right. Yeah, I just wanted to dig on that because I don't necessarily think that Bitcoiners or even even gold investors necessarily are aware that Farmland delivers the same, if not better protection on maybe the main reason why they're buying those two other assets.
Farmland is also you get returns both from asset appreciation and from cash flow. So that's one of the reasons that makes it superior to the other asset classes.
Great point. And I'm sure we're well, I know for sure we'll get into the cash flow part, whether it's in your slides or not, because I'm going to ask about it.
OK, great. All right. Digging in a little bit more into how Farmland works and the asset class and performance over time. Again, there's two sources of return.
One is asset appreciation. The other is is cash flow on that. And this is just average Farmland across the US.
So the what you see here is the dollars per acre starting in 1997, going from my eyes are just not so good.
Twelve hundred dollars per acre. And now since then, going up to over five thousand four hundred dollars per acre over that period of time.
And cash rent has also increased over that period of time. And if you add these two numbers together, it comes to about twelve and a half percent.
But that eleven to twelve percent annualized return is the industry metric, typically delivering around eleven to twelve percent annualized return, half from cash flow, half from appreciation.
Oh, my goodness. So you're saying the average industry return is eleven to twelve percent when you add everything together?
Unlever. Yes. Right. Leverage only makes it better, right? That's right. Well, yeah.
Wow. OK, great. I know a lot of people that love to be getting that annually. Leverage at ten percent doesn't make it better. Leverage at, you know, three percent makes it better.
And responsible use of it. And actually, just to talk about leverage seriously for a second. In other forms of commercial real estate, like I showed on those other slides, typically institutional managers do want to have like 60 percent leverage on their portfolios or more.
And we generally buy all the farmland with cash and then we can use debt as long as it's reasonably priced to do some of the improvements like planting organic blueberries or vineyards or things like that on the land.
So we like to be kind of under 30 percent total leverage at at peak.
OK. And you're talking specifically at your fund Farmland LP. Yeah. And again, we'll talk about this a bit later. But one of the things that I really like about your model is because so much of farmland is leased, a lot of those people that are leasing those acres, they're just focused on a given season on growing whatever they can sell at the end of the harvest.
Right. They're not necessarily wanting to or able to make long term investments in the land itself.
And I know that one of the things your fund has done is put in smart irrigation systems. I mean, it's just a lot of things that might take years to start producing a return.
But once they do, they will produce returns for a long time into the future. But it takes a lot of capital up front.
And so anyways, we'll get into the specifics of your model for a moment. But this sort of goes back to your earlier point about being able to bring efficiencies to the land that maybe weren't there before.
So it sounds like that's one of the main reasons why when you do use debt responsibly, you're using it for those sort of long term ROI projects.
That's right. And why don't I just talk about why we do what we do for a second because it's really just a general way of managing the farmland.
So modern economies in general and farmers in particular, the economies of scale are so important nowadays.
The larger your operations and the more efficient your operations are, essentially the better.
And if you have five thousand acres worth of farmland, so the average commodity farmer has eight and a half million dollars worth of land and equipment and makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year.
So that two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year is enough to kind of pay for, you know, save for retirement, pay for their kids to go to college and things like that.
But it's not actually kind of an abundance of income on there. And it's hard to make kind of multi-year large capex investments on these assets.
And if they're focused as farmland, if they're focused on getting their cash flow every year from farmland, if you have five thousand acres of farmland, the most operationally efficient thing to do is to grow one crop on that year.
Year after year. On that land, that's operationally efficient.
You get one type of equipment and you sell, grow one crop, sell it. It's great. Just for folks, understand that that's called mono cropping.
Right. If you've heard that term before, that that's mono cropping. And fifty three percent of U.S. farmland grows two commodity crops, corn and soy.
Wow. So it is the dominant form of agriculture in the U.S. And the big problems with it are that in order to grow one crop year after year after year, you're really going against the basically kind of the natural systems.
And it requires a tremendous amount of fertilizers, tremendous amount of pesticides, herbicides for the land. You require genetically modified seeds to actually resist all of those herbicides that you're spraying to kill the weeds, but you don't want them to kill the plants.
So that really is what typifies modern, operationally efficient agriculture, mono cropping. We set it up so that we would look at the land and say, hey, what's the best way to get productivity from farmland as an asset?
And the best way to get from productivity from farmland is really focusing on healthy soil biology side. And that is growing at least four crops, having diversification each year and then rotating those crops over time.
Good old crop rotations. The problem for a normal farmer is that it's not efficient operationally to grow four crops on one piece of ground and rotate them year after year.
So our approach was, you know what, let's just scale this up. We'll buy the farmland, we'll determine what the ideal crop rotations are on that land, and then we'll bring in kind of the best organic tomato farmers, the best grain farmers, the best pasture and sheep and cattle farmers on the land.
And we'll manage the rotations over time so that each of those individual farmers can operate at the maximum economy of scale and be the best and they can, you know, Whole Foods or Costco goes to them and wants them to double their production.
They just simply can lease more land from us, go from 200 acres to 400 acres of organic tomatoes that next year and just rotate around the properties. The farmers are more productive, they're more profitable, and the land is getting the proper rotations.
Okay, so we're digging a little bit into the second half of this discussion, which was what's the farmland? No, but it's good because it's instructive. You're contrasting it to how things are done today. So essentially, you guys sort of operate as the general contractor for the farmland itself, where you're asking yourself what specialist is best for each part of the property, and you're bringing in, okay, if we think tomatoes should go over here, well, let's get the best, you know, organic tomato farmer to
manage that part, right? And then you're saying, okay, next year, we're going to move the tomato guys over here, and we're going to put the hail guys where the lettuce guys were, and you're doing your crop rotation. I know I'm being overly simplistic here, but hopefully this is sort of the spirit of what you're doing.
The key thing that you talked about, too, that I just want to underscore is the monocropping, you have to bring all those artificial inputs in year after year after year, and then you have to bring in all the other elements to, you know, let those artificial inputs work, right, like the pesticides and all that type of stuff, right?
And it really is, to my understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's almost like an annual soil strip mining operation, right, where you keep depleting the soil year after year, which is why you have to keep bringing those inputs in the nitrogen, you know, the potassium, etc, all that stuff that's going to come back in there.
Is it fair to say that your approach is actually building soil over time? It certainly sounds like it's building soil health, soil microbes over time, but you're actually sort of adding layers to the soil and creating a healthier ecosystem, versus just sort of nuking the ecosystem year after year and starting from zero at the beginning of every year.
That's right. And you can actually mine kind of original soil, healthy soil, you can actually go a few years with kind of taking advantage of the system, it's kind of like pulling money out of your bank account, even though you're kind of losing money over here, maybe putting putting charges on your credit card.
Now, as long as you make your minimum payment, you're okay. But at some point, you kind of reach the max and in agriculture, about five years of strip mining that soil, you start you get to the point where it costs you more to put in the fertilizers put in get the GMO seeds, spray with the herbicides put all those costs there before it actually would have been better had you stayed in the crop rotation system.
Right. So that's why we spend three years, it takes three years to convert land organic, but a lot of that time is actually spent really focusing on improving and restoring the natural soil fertility in that. And then we are the farmland managers.
So we're kind of we're the advocate for the farmland and designing these rotations. And that's where we're preserving and actually increasing the quality of that farmland over time sequestering half a ton to a ton worth of carbon per year, increasing the soil microbes and that soil health as well.
We're making investments in capex. To go back to the first part of your, your comment, you know, in, in the old day, in the old days, you know, you have the Sears Tower and the Chrysler building so I'm talking about commercial real estate.
Those companies had to actually build their own office buildings in order to house their employees. And then in the 70s Congress put in the REIT regulations real estate investment trust so that people could invest in real estate as an asset class, as opposed to kind of forcing these buildings to do it.
What happened is, is that now, you know, companies don't have to spend their money building an office building, they can focus on the things that are really adding value, but the REIT sector actually outperforms the stock market on average over the decades.
So, professional real estate is, is a great way of managing because you can put the best tenants in the penthouse and the best retail clients at the bottom and normal business tenants in between. That's multi tenant commercial real estate.
We're looking at farmland as multi tenant commercial real estate, managing multiple farmers across land according to that highest and best use for the farmland.
All right, great. The highest and best use of the farmland, I'm going to dig more specifically into kind of how you're doing that but I've interrupted your flow here with the chart so let's finish the charts first.
Okay, great. So just a quick picture here on on the value of farmland across the United States. So, now this includes both irrigated and non irrigated farmland, some areas have much more irrigated and high value farmland and some of them have less.
But what you can see here for example is that California is some of the most expensive or most high value farmland in the US, California grows 50 to 80% of the fruits, vegetables and nuts in the US.
If you look at the Corn Belt, Iowa, for example, and Illinois, you see some also high dollar value and you've had a lot of increases in that area.
You have places like Oregon and Washington for example that look like they're lower value, but that's partially a measure of like Washington grows a tremendous amount of dry land wheat there.
But the irrigated areas are also the number one producer of apples and hops and blueberries and other things so there's a lot of very high value cropland as well as some lower value farmland as well.
This just gives you an idea of how it's distributed. I just got to ask because it's there. New Jersey actually is the highest state which surprised me a little bit. I mean, I know I'm from the northeast, it's called the Garden State.
What's driving that there? It's the home of blueberries. So the blueberry plant basically originated there.
Interesting. I didn't know that when I asked this question, folks, but I suspect that's going to become an important point when Craig and I talk a little bit later about what Farmland LP is doing because I know blueberries have been a big success story for you guys.
Love blueberries.
So, we talked a little bit that the value of the crops, drive the cash flow and the value of farmland, and I just wanted to give some specifics for that. So, the chart on the left here is the profit per acre by crop.
And this is operating profit here. And so, if you look over here, it starts with conventional seed and conventional row crops. Those are annual crops like, you know, corn, etc. that are grown.
If you convert those to organic, you can double or triple or more the revenue and the profit per acre. So organic seeds, organic row are higher than that.
And then some example higher value crops, hops, wine grapes, apples, blueberries, wine grapes, for example, that we grow in Oregon, gross revenue per acre and rents per acre on this.
So commodity corn generally will generate around $1,000 per acre of gross revenue and rents for $300 an acre.
You convert that to organic, you'll generate three to $5,000 gross revenue per acre, and it rents for $750 an acre. And generally the farmers making the same amount of money as the as the rent is so profits are generally split kind of 50/50 is a nice simple way of thinking about it.
If you're, we grow wine grapes, generating eight to $10,000 per acre gross revenue at 40 to 50% gross margins, because if we rent out that land, it'll rent for around $1,100 or $1,200 an acre.
But if we farm it ourselves, it's around 40% gross margins on eight to $10,000 per acre. And that translates to around $4,000 per acre net and blueberries are even higher than that 30 to $50,000 gross revenue per acre and profits around $10,000 an acre or so.
Wow, yeah, you can really see why blueberries take the cake there. For apples and blueberries there, are those organic or is that sort of a blended average right now?
Blueberries are organic, wine grapes are not on this chart.
Okay.
Another way to add value is to convert it to organic as you as you see on this chart over here, and the organic food market has been growing at double digits for 25 years.
And the supply of organic farmland has only been growing at a fraction at about half of that. It's only 1.2% of US farmland is certified organic, even though around 6% of the US food budget is organic food.
And there's a lot of organic imports. We're basically just not keeping up with the amount of organic farmland.
This just blows my mind, because I've talked with you for many years, the anemic rate at which organic cropland is growing and what a tiny fraction it is of total overall cropland in the US versus the just huge leaps in demand year after year.
We always think the free market will catch up to demand, but you really do have a lot of constraints here in the farmland industry, which I guess for someone who's got a model like yours that is focused on organic and sustainability.
I think it's like a great tailwind on your business. There's just going to always be overwhelming demand for your products, because there's such a gap between supply and demand in the organic space. Is that true?
It's very true. The CEO of Costco a few years ago. So Costco sells about 10% of the organic food sold in the US. And he said a little bit ago that they can't get enough organic supply to keep their shelves stocked day after day.
So the actual size of the organic market, the demand for the organic food would be larger than what's on this chart. This is just the supply that was available times the price that people paid for it.
So if there's not enough organic food, it's not really reflecting the actual demand for it. And the key issue constraining the organic supply is actually converting farmland from conventional to organic.
It takes three years to do that. And generally you're not making any profits on that. You're growing some crops, but it's really not profitable. And for a large commodity farmer that's making $250,000 a year, that feeds his family.
You can't just tell your family we're not eating for the next three years.
Exactly. Oh, you want to go to college? You know, tough. And that's a $750,000 investment over those three years. So to be able to invest in high quality farmland with great water rights, convert that to organic, and then make it available to those farmers to hop on without them having to worry about crop rotations.
Allows them to specialize in one crop and expand on the scale that they need as well. So it's really win, win, win for everybody.
All right. Yeah. I get the win, win, win. I see it as a strategic moat for what you're doing because you figured out how to do this at scale. You've got the scale now. You've got the momentum. You've got the financing behind you.
But there's a lot of your competition that can't. So good advantage for you guys. I'm wondering, do you ever have the problem of somebody, say like a Costco coming to you and tempting you with a, "Hey, Craig, I'll just buy everything you grow for the next 10 years or forever."
I mean, do you have to be cautious as you're managing kind of the business and your vision and your upside for it to hold suitors like that at bay who are coming to you with these attractive offers?
Because it seems to me that given this gap, these guys have got to be just scouring the world for whatever organic product they can find at the margin.
Yeah. You know, the key thing about the business is we're farmland managers. So we're farmland LP. We want to own farmland and manage it well.
We do some farming, but really our business is based on providing farmland to other great farmers. Over 40 different crops grow on our land.
We have relationships with a lot of different farmers. When Costco or Whole Foods, we have a slide that shows all the different buyers basically of crops from our land come around.
We actually play matchmaker. We say, "Hey, farmer, are you able to meet this customer's demand?" And really, we're fully leased out with our farmland for the organic vegetables.
For example, one of the reasons why we're raising our next fund is so that we can have more farmland so that our farmers can grow more crops.
All right. Super fascinating. Sorry, I keep interrupting your flow here. Let's move on with the charts. It's just so interesting. I apologize.
That's great. This chart is a little complicated, but I'm really going to try to simplify it. This is wine grape. This is sales of bottles of wine by price point on there.
This is the two-buck Chuck area. This is $4 a bottle, basically $8 a bottle, $10, $14, $18, et cetera, up to $100 a bottle wine.
You're seeing total sales. The key part of this trend that you see is that the cheap wines, sales are going down, but high-quality wines that are at a good price,
so $14 a bottle, $18 a bottle wine, sales are actually growing and increasing on there. This kind of makes a fundamental point that people have money to spend on high-quality food.
They don't want junk. They'll spend more, a reasonable amount more. I can tell the difference between a $4 bottle of wine and a $20 bottle of wine.
The difference between a $20 bottle of wine and a $60 bottle of wine, not so much. I'm sure a lot of people in your audience can tell that.
I love the wine that we grow, but it's a very nice part of the quality curve. Basically, the whole market, we're getting to the point where it used to be the two-buck Chuck and the cheaper wines had vastly higher market share than the $12 to $15 bottle wines.
Now, the $4 bottle of wine market size is the same as the $14 a bottle market size. $8 a bottle market share now is the $18 size.
What you're seeing is that food is cheap in the U.S. Eleven percent of the U.S. food budget is spent on food. Other countries, it's 30 percent. Less developed countries, it's 50 percent of their annual budget is spent on food.
In the U.S., we have access to tremendously high quality food. Food is cheap and people are paying money for high quality, not just the lowest cost generic quality. You see this in wine, you see it in the organic food markets, you see it in things like blueberries and healthy fruits, prepared food and salads.
The prepackaged salads are really continuing to increase dramatically. That is a theme. I think that people shouldn't be too focused on the doom and gloom side of this, that people do have money and they are spending it on things that they care about.
I would imagine, Craig, that you said organic demands going up and projected to go up in the foreseeable future. That just means more and more people are becoming aware of the importance of organic, both from a quality standpoint, it tastes better, but also it's just better for my and my family's health.
It seems to me that that's a decision that not too many people are going to go backwards on. In other words, even if times get tight financially, you're probably going to cut in a lot of other places of your life before you say, "I'm going to stop feeding my family organic and start feeding them conventional again."
If you've gotten to the point you feel like conventional is less healthy, I know it's cheaper, but I don't want to be feeding my kids less healthy products. It feels to me like once the consumer has crossed the chasm from conventional to organic, probably very hard for them to go backwards. Would you agree with that?
I think you nailed it. Family is the key word there. The number one source of new organic consumers is new parents. The gateway drug for organic is organic milk.
When a mom goes from breastfeeding to providing a bottle, when the woman gets pregnant, typically you see them increase their organic buying behavior. Organic milk becomes mandatory when the babies start bottle feeding and beyond.
Then it's those first foods, organic Cheerios, organic blueberries, snack foods. You may want non-organic food, and that's fine, but for your kids, you're going to want to step up. You're going to want to invest in that, and you really don't go back from that.
Then you have whole new generations grown on the importance to understand, "Hey, organic food is important," and they continue their buying behavior as they leave the house. There's very good reasons for it.
The people who don't eat organic food have high levels of glyphosate, Roundup, in their urine. Then when they switch over to organic food for a couple weeks, those glyphosate numbers just drop dramatically. That's just a simple indicator, but it's actually meaningful.
Great. Folks, you don't have time to really get into the evils of glyphosate, but if you've never heard of it, you probably should Google it. It does a lot of havoc inside the body, and sadly, glyphosate is in so many packaged foods out there. It's ridiculous, scandalous, I would say even. That's a discussion for another time.
Agreed.
We're just wrapping up here just to make it relevant for people's portfolio. This chart shows basically the percentage of different assets in people who have different levels of net worth.
You see someone has $100K of net worth or $1 million or $10 million or $100 million. The three things that I want to highlight here are mutual funds and stocks, fixed income is in there as well, but real estate is actually a very durable portion of people's portfolio, even as their wealth increases.
This is not their primary residence. Red is actually the primary residence. This kind of medium blue is investment real estate. You see it's about a third of the investment in equities is in real estate for the average person worth $10 million.
Those trends actually, it's a very substantial portion as people increase their wealth.
I'm just curious. So real estate as an asset class can offer attractive tax breaks. Does farmland do as well?
You can invest in our funds two ways. We actually provide a corporate blocker, which allows you to invest without having to worry about tax implications. You just get a 1099 div each year when we do cash distributions. It looks like just holding any other company.
We do allow investing into the partnership side of it, which then you're going to get a K1 and then you're going to have some complexities if you're investing via an IRA or a tax deferred account or other things like that.
Most people, almost all people, end up investing in the corporate blocker because it's really easier to hold. Farmland has less tax benefits than an apartment building. In an apartment building, 75% of the value is the building, which depreciates. You get a tax benefit each year.
25% is the land. That does not depreciate. In farmland, it's the reverse of that. Most of the value is in land, which doesn't depreciate. There are some tax benefits, but it makes more sense to hold it in this corporate blocker structure.
In farming and farmland, having a diversified portfolio is very important. We wanted to highlight some key things so that you could diversify your portfolios over time.
In general, you want to diversify away from the corn and soy commodity crops. The corn, for example, is highly volatile on there. It's okay to have some, but you really want to diversify into things, for example, like permanent crops and other forms of annual crops.
Annual crops are those crops that you plant and harvest each year. Permanent crops are things like fruit trees and nut trees and wine grapes, things that you plant and blueberries that you plant once.
It takes a few years to mature, but then delivers very long-term and high-level cash flows over a long period of time. You want to invest in both development properties and cash flowing properties.
You want to limit your correlation with the debt markets. It's one of the great things about farmland. Don't screw it up by using too much debt on there.
We really use the science of climate change and have since we started in terms of looking at what the potential impacts might be 10, 20, 50, 100 years out into the future. We think that's an important factor when you're buying farmland. We didn't talk about sunshine, dirt, and water are the key factors of farmland, but climate change affects both sunshine and water on there if you're looking at 10 years or more.
We do think you should look at how the managers are adding value to your farmland versus buying a passive portfolio or passive REIT.
And then so this leads right into what are the different ways of investing in farmland? So you can buy a farm, for example, and that has a number of implications. Hopefully you're going to retire and I recommend farming, you know, nine square feet in your garden before you look at buying a farm.
But it is possible but low returning as an individual. You could invest in, for example, publicly traded REITs. There really are not a lot of them. There's two main ones, Gladstone Land and another one which I won't mention because I don't have good things to say.
But it is a way of doing it. But then you're really correlated with the markets. You have more debt exposure, you have more stock market exposure. You can do some of that, but you're losing some of the benefits.
You can crowdsource into a farm, so acre trader or farm together. You can buy kind of individual properties. There you can get access, you can build a diversified portfolio, but count on buying at least five to 10 different deals.
Don't just invest into one deal and say, "Oh, I'm done." You really need diversification there. You're not going to get the management economies of scale in that.
You're going to have five or 10 different properties and different geographies with different managers on that. But it can be an option. It tends to be kind of more expensive as well when you kind of unpack all the expenses there as well.
And then invest in something like a value-add fund where they're providing you with that kind of diversified portfolio, selecting high quality farmland, adding value to that farmland and delivering various ways of adding value, whether it's sustainability and things like that.
All right, great. And you would put your operations or farmland LP into that value-add fund category, correct?
I did if my hidden bias didn't come through well. I expect it came through just a little bit, but yes. We're a value-added farmland manager.
And so just again to kind of summarize why invest in farmland and then we're done, the demand exceeds the supply for food now and off into the future.
It's a consolidating sector. We're actually literally losing farmland year after year. Over 20 years, we lose farmland the size of the state of Florida.
So farmland is a declining asset class. It's delivered great performance over decades. It's very much of a proven asset class.
It beats inflation reliably and it can deliver a positive impact on the environment that grows healthy food, healthy soils, and really creates a future for your kids to grow up in.
And I think especially if you're looking at long-term investing, you're doing it for your future and for your kids' future. We think having your money in something that really makes a long-term difference is important.
And regeneratively managed farmland is a great way of doing that.
All right. I'm guessing that a number of the viewers here are probably giving you the online equivalent of a standing ovation there, Craig.
I mean, what's not to love about all those things that you just listed there, right?
So we've talked about farmland as an asset class. Through that conversation, we pulled forward a lot of the elements that you do with the Farmland LP model, which is your fund that you run.
We've come up on the hour mark a lot faster than I thought we would. But what's great is, as you anticipated, just about all the questions I had here.
So great job. I don't have too many more to ask, but just a couple as we begin to wrap up here.
The first is, is there anything else about the Farmland LP model that we haven't talked about that you think is worth surfacing for folks?
And then I know that you guys are raising a third fund and that you very kindly offered to put together a free webinar for anybody who's watched this video
and would be interested in learning more about that fund in case they want to potentially become an investor. I want to give you a chance to talk about that for a few minutes
and direct people where to go who are interested. But first, is there anything else about the Farmland LP model that we haven't talked about that you think is worth putting on people's radars?
Sure. So it's about kind of farmland as an asset class and people's investment portfolios. Farmland is great as a long term asset class.
So your investment horizon generally should be at least five years, if not 10 years or longer in this.
Don't buy it if you're looking to get out in a quarter or two. It's not an in and out type of investment.
No, absolutely not. And so for example, you should have a retirement portfolio, for example, where your first five years are covered in terms of your S&P 500, your bond portfolio, et cetera.
And then as you have additional capital beyond that, that's really when you look to diversify and get some of the benefits of diversification in your portfolio.
And so we really take that to heart and have designed this so that the first three to five years, we're really spending adding value to that portfolio, converting that farmland to organic, planting high quality permanent crops.
Not a lot of cash flow is generated during that period of time. So getting asset appreciation and value creation, especially like what's happening in the ground there may or may not show up fully on the portfolio.
But as those permanent crops mature, for example, and increase their cash flow and yield, that's when the real value happens over the long haul.
So cash flow increases significantly, lots of capital gains when you convert row crop ground to vineyard acres or convert it to organic blueberries and such.
And then you're able to just kind of manage it or benefit from that over the long haul. We do set up our funds as 10 year funds.
At the end of that term, you can exit for sure. But we really ask you, hey, do you really want to exit? If you don't, you just can stay in and keep going, not have that taxable capital gain.
You can hold on to it for the duration, pass it on to your kids, etc. So we really work to provide liquidity for the investors that want it, but also make it so that you can stay in for that long haul.
And that to me is what makes this asset class so beautiful.
OK, great. I really appreciate you putting up that last slide, going through the different options for investing in farmland.
One, just to sort of help people understand the landscape, but also give people options that they can go explore if they're not able to participate in any one of those quadrants.
And so Farmland LP, I believe your third fund that you've now got open for investment, it's not available to everybody.
Right. I think that people have to have a certain net worth or whatnot to participate in that.
And yeah, let us know about that. Let us know. But I guess what you're trying to do with Fund 3 and anything you want to know about it.
And then once you tell us that, tell us where people can go to sign up for that webinar that I mentioned.
Great. So the we're limited by the SEC to accredited investors, which basically means you make over two hundred thousand dollars a year or have a million dollars net worth on there.
The investment minimum is 100K. That's actually up from the 50K that we had for previous funds for your investors.
We can make exceptions if that's if that's really needed for them.
But that's that's the overall structure there. OK. And so Fund 3 is bigger than the previous funds.
So what's what's what are you trying to accomplish with this new fund? That's right.
So Fund 3. So we managed two hundred seventy five million dollars worth of farmland today.
It's in three investment hubs. Our strategy is to buy at least 50 million dollars worth of farmland in one tight geographic area so we can have an onsite farm manager there.
And really focus on maximizing that farmland.
So doing capex, doing the organic conversions, focusing on healthy soil rotation, crop rotations on that land.
And what that allows us to do is to one, serve farmers and help them kind of grow their business.
Well, we're kind of maxed out in each of our geographies with tenants.
And so the Fund 3 is another two hundred and fifty million dollars so that we can expand our footprint in those areas,
take even more advantage of the economies of scale on our land, help our farmers grow their operations and really provide investors with a scalable and straightforward way to invest in organic farmland.
Got it. OK. And just so to summarize in a nutshell, it sounds like what you're saying is we've got these geographies where we've really dialed in over time how to use the land most efficiently and effectively.
We've got the right people, the right systems in place. We know what crops to grow and what combination.
Now, we just want to do it at a bigger scale in all those same areas. That's what the new capital is going to help you do.
That's right. And as we get to the top of that two hundred and fifty million dollars, we may add one additional fifty million dollar geography, but that'll be decided towards the end of that capital raise.
OK, so that free webinar where you're going to go into a lot of detail about Fund 3 and take live investor questions and tell anybody that is interested after they've gone through all that,
where they can go to learn more and potentially maybe even become an investor in it. If I got my notes correct, that's going to happen this coming Tuesday, February 6th.
That'll be at 7 p.m. Eastern, 4 p.m. Pacific. For folks that want to register again for free for that, where should they go or what should they do?
So they can send us an email at IR, investor relations, IR@farmlandlp.com. If you say webinar at the top, then we'll get you signed up and send you the information that you need.
All right. Great. Well, it's always great talking to you, Craig. And like you said, we've known each other for now and I on 15 years, and it's just been tremendous to see what you've been able to do with Farmland LP from just your very first properties there in California,
how you've now spread out across the whole West Coast, how you've gotten up to scale and are doing this great job of sort of, you know, healing slash improving the soil and the land itself,
which as an investor, it's just, I got to say from my own personal experience, it's great to actually be invested in something that's not only tangible, like I've gone out on your investor days and walked the properties and whatnot.
You can see it, you can feel it, you can smell it, you can eat produce that's come off the land itself, but just to see how you are making the ecology better, the land better, the soil better.
We're leaving a better legacy, I believe, at least in the funds that I've been in, you know, to future generations, but at the same time, it produces cash flow and it has a very attractive appreciation track record as well.
So kudos to you for everything you and the Farmland LP team have done. Folks, if you've enjoyed this learning experience about farmland, please let Craig know by hitting the like button and then clicking the subscribe button below as well as that little bell icon right next to it.
Craig, I'm sure we're going to get tons of questions about farmland in general that we didn't capture here, so I'd love to have you back on the program again at some point in the future to tackle those if you're willing for it.
And if we can wrap it up here real quick, two things. One is it's fun to be able to start doing this again, but now that I've got thoughtful money fully up and running and I passed that securities exam the other week,
I now can refer people to our financial advisory partners again, and folks, if you are considering whether farmland makes sense inside your portfolio, and if so, how much of your portfolio might make sense to put in it,
feel free to talk to one of our endorsed financial advisory partners and get their feedback for free. These are the partners you'll see on this channel with me week after week, you know, Lance Roberts and his team at RIA,
John and Mike and the guys at New Harbor and Jonathan Wellum up in Canada, to schedule a free consultation with one of those advisors, just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com and fill out the short form there.
All right, as we wrap up here, Craig, I do, if we can, want to ask you the parting question I've been asking all the other guests on this program. We've been talking about a wonderful asset here, but still largely a financial one.
We're talking about it from the financial angle. What's a non-financial or non-money related investment that you would encourage people to consider adopting in their lives?
The most important, so the most important thing is happiness to invest in. And fundamentally, I think the quote that might typify that would be, don't sweat the small stuff. And rule number two is it's all small stuff. So happiness.
Happiness. All right. And I guess I'd put in there as well, perspective. Don't let all the zillion of things that are going to come your way in the course of an average day get you down, spin you up too much. Just focus on maintaining and even keeling being happy.
I can say as a parent, at the end of the day, I always tell my kids, at the end of the day, that's what I want for you guys. You don't have to be a CEO if you're happy is doing something a lot more modest.
I'm totally cool with that. As long as at the end of the day, you're living a life that makes you happy. So very wise words. Yeah.
Hey, pay other people to deal with your problems. We're farmland managers, so we deal with those kinds of problems every day, but we love it. I love this. This is amazing.
So this is where having kind of a team and partnership around you, really where everyone can basically have their oar in the water, just really makes everything better.
And you focus on the things that make you happy and that are productive and add value. So that's what we do.
All right. Well, great advice, folks. And so, folks, again, if you're inspired to learn more about what Farmland LP is up to and what's going to happen with Farm3, if you're interested in that webinar, again, it is going to be Tuesday, February 6th at 7pm Eastern, 4pm Pacific.
If you're interested in hearing, listening to it, go to IR or send an email to IR@farmlandlp.com. Put webinar in the subject line there. And Craig, I know you said you'd only take accredited investors in the fund, but can anybody attend the webinar and just learn?
Oh, sure. Absolutely. Yeah. We want to educate people about farmland and how it works and what the opportunities are. Absolutely.
All right. Fantastic. All right, Craig. Well, thanks so much for joining us again. Great presentation. Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
All right. Thank you so much for watching.
