Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. Inflation's been called
the invisible tax. Economist John Maynard Keynes wrote that through it, "Governments can
confiscate secretly and unobserved an important part of the wealth of their citizens in a process
that engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner
which not one man in a million is able to diagnose." Which is why it's very important to know what's
happening with inflation and where it's headed, but should we rely on governments reported numbers
as distorted as they are by fudge factors like hedonics and substitution and possible manipulation
for political optics? No, says today's guest, Oliver Rust, co-founder of Trueflation, a new
blockchain-based real-time inflation calculation service that uses over 10 million data points to
yield a more accurate measurement that represents what households actually experience. We'll find
out what he thinks the true inflation rate is and where he sees it heading next. Oliver, thanks so
much for joining us today. Thanks a lot for having me on. I appreciate that and just so folks know you
were staying up late on the other side of the planet to have this conversation. I really appreciate
you doing that. Oliver, I've been looking forward to having you on for a good while. I've mentioned
Trueflation a number of times on this program, as do people in the comments section pretty
frequently. I think it was first put on my radar by Danielle DiMartino Booth who's a big fan of your
work. I've got a number of questions here for you. Real quick before we dive in, I just want to let folks

Alright, Oliver, lots of questions here for you all zeroed in on inflation. Before we start
though if I can just ask you a more general question, what's your current assessment of the
global economy?
Yeah, look I think the US obviously unexpectedly posted some really strong economic growth in
quarter four. I think Europe struggled a bit and is starting to see some light at the end of the
tunnel to a certain degree. I think you've got situations in Asia Pacific that aren't as rosy
and it's predominantly driven by the Chinese economy and the Japanese economy. The bright
light, the bright star so to speak that's shining from an economic standpoint is definitely the US.
Alright, definitely the US. Now some folks are wondering if the
economy is chugging along so strongly in the US and we're seeing things like wage growth that
continue to contribute to inflation and the Fed is now talking about rate cuts this year. Could
we see some sort of resurgence of inflation here in the US as a result of all that? We'll get to
that in just a minute. Before we do though, let's just explain for folks, let folks
understand why you founded trueflation in the first place. As I said in the intro, I believe
that you believe it is a more accurate measurement of inflation. What prompted you to say, "Hey, the
world needs a better measurement"? Yeah, so I think we were looking at an inflation
measurement as a whole and we were looking through trying to create inflationary protected products,
so if people were going to create inflationary protected products, what sort of
inflationary measurement was out there? Our viewpoint is that our objective is to launch a
measurement tool that is the most comprehensive inflation measurement tool out there. We're not
here to replace or find an alternative measurement for inflation as for the BLS or for
that matter the PCE price index or other forms of prices like the producers price index and
so forth, but our objective is to provide the most comprehensive inflation measurement and in part,
we believe that the systems that are being used today to report inflation have been set up
a long time ago. In fact, the CPI measure was set up pre-First World War and it hasn't really
evolved in the way it's done today and so for that purpose, whether it's the number of items it's
tracking, it tracks about 80,000 items, the method it uses, it uses a price check and it uses a
survey-based approach and they all got inherent issues and our viewpoint is we wanted to create a
more updated measurement so we want to make sure it's updated daily rather than monthly.
We wanted to have a much more volumetric data set so you're talking about in the intro about having
more than 10 million items. We're now up to about more than 14 million items that we track on a
daily basis and we also don't want to rely on one data source so we rely on a minimum of three data
sources before we release an index out there. Today we're operating with more than 40 different
data partners to be able to produce this measurement tool for the market.
All right, great. So when you say at least three data sources, if you're saying
someone's buying a box of Cheerios, you get three different prices from three different sources for
a box of Cheerios and I guess average it? Yeah, so especially in the food category in
particular, we use a data aggregator which is Nielsen. We have another data aggregator
called Decca which looks after loyalty card data. We also have data directly from retailers like
Amazon, Walmart, and so forth. So if you're looking at that volume of data that we're dealing with,
we have multiple different price points as you say for a box of Cheerios and that gives us a
pretty good understanding of how price is moving and not only how price is moving, it's also
how factors like discounting or promotions are affecting consumer switching behavior because
consumers, we've noticed very clearly consumers have substituted products of higher price points
into lower price points products and whether they've forgiven on the volume that they're
purchasing or they're just substituting it for a lower price point product, both of those situations
are happening and that's causing a different variation. So we need to make sure that we track
multiple different price points to be able to have the most accurate measurement in the marketplace.
Okay, interesting. And I'm just trying to understand how your service differs from the
official government data like the BLS. So is yours, and I don't mean this in any negative way,
but is it simply a brute force approach that says we're just looking at what people are paying
for all these different products using all these different sources and that's just the number
versus the government numbers, like I said, they have things like hedonics that try to say,
"Well, because the TV got cheaper, it's actually a better value and we're going to massage the
numbers this way to compensate for it," and what they do is substitution. There's sort of
estimations that go on in there that aren't necessarily true compared to what people are
paying at the counter. Is yours much more just a reflection of like, "Hey, this is just what we're
seeing people pay across this much bigger universe"? Yeah, that's correct. We want to reflect
what consumers are experiencing from their price points and how it's affecting themselves
across a multitude of categories. And given the volume of data that we deal with,
we don't need to add additional calculations in the system like a substitution calculation
or hedonics calculation for quality adjustments. We don't need to have that factor because we're
seeing how consumers are spending on individual products because of the volume of data that we're
dealing with. If you take, for example, the BLS, they have an 80,000 price point they check out.
They have a 6,000 survey for household rent information and all that gives us that 80,000
price point. How much that 80,000 items that they're checking are in food, are in apparel,
are in electronics. We're not 100% sure how many price points they're checking in each of those
scenarios, but you get an idea and say in food, even if it is 50,000 items, we're dealing,
in food alone, we're dealing with 8 million items of price points. That volume allows us to create
a much more comprehensive measurement of how consumers are adapting to the price changes
in the marketplace. All right. How has your calculated number compared to CPI? Have they
been largely in agreement? Have they been wildly different? Do they align at certain times and
diverge at others? Yeah. Interesting question. Let me say that first of all, our objective
to inflation is not to replace the BLS. Our objective is to provide an alternative view
of how inflation is moving in the marketplace. That alternative view is, as we discussed,
there's a combination of looking at these 14 million different data points, 40 different
data sources and being updated daily. Now, in turn, a lot of our customers are saying, "Okay,
well, how do I use this?" One of the applications is, how do I use this to forecast what the BLS is
doing? In that, we are seeing our trend line, if you compare directly with our late data with the
BLS, we're seeing that we have different numbers. In the earlier part of the year, we were earlier
part of the inflationary rise back in 2020, we were probably ahead of the curve. In other words,
we were reporting a higher number than the BLS, and now we're reporting a lower number than the
BLS. I think if you look at how do we compare then the individual categories to the BLS,
it's in part because the BLS is lagging the true inflation data in certain categories to
quite an extent. In the smaller lagged categories like food and apparel, where the frequency of
purchases is a lot higher, the BLS is having a lower lag compared to where true inflation is.
If it's in the longer purchase intervals, let's say like housing, which is the most extreme,
we have a seven-month lag. We tend to look at it and say, "Well, the data that true inflation is
reporting is potentially a leading indicator of where the BLS goes." What we tend to do is,
for those customers who want to compare exactly how our data is translating back to the BLS,
we then take all our data sets and we align it back into the BLS categories and apply
their weighting onto our data that is categorized according to the BLS categories. We get a pretty
dang good correlation with what the BLS is. In fact, you'll probably see Danielle Martini-Booth,
she had a correlation of 0.97%, so it's pretty much spot on if we start comparing the two data
sets. That's only after we have merged our data back into the BLS data and their weighting factors.
If you look at a straight comparison of our data versus theirs, yes, we are generally higher than
they were and now we're becoming lower than they are. Okay, and it sounds like that difference that
you see is maybe more a time shift where you're saying that they have more lagging data in there,
so when you guys diverge, they generally catch up to you over time? That's correct. We tend to see
it catching up or when it stabilizes, I'd say more of an equilibrium coming into play, but yes,
there is a delay in the data sets they have and that's in particular being driven by the housing
category. That's the one category that causes a lot of discrepancies and that's in part because
the BLS decides to take a rented data survey, household consumer survey, to determine what
people are paying for their rent and then apply that same survey result onto the people that own
their property. I think we look at that owned part considerably differently, where we look at
property values, we look at mortgages, outstanding mortgages, we look at the interest rates people
are paying on those mortgages and that changes literally how much people need to spend. I think
that's a pretty different way of looking at this because not everyone owns their mortgage,
not everyone is paying a five percent mortgage, some people are paying two percent interest on
their mortgage, some people don't have a mortgage left on their properties and you can't
attribute that same phenomenon to everybody. Yeah, a couple questions that I should have asked
earlier. In your 14 million items, factors that you're gathering data on, I imagine
goods, good information on goods, probably pretty easy to get a hold of. I assume you also are
measuring services as well, price of services? That's correct. Okay. In at least the government
data here, and housing's kind of a big part of this, but it's services where the inflation still
seems to be quote unquote sticky. Are you guys seeing the same thing or as you said, your
true inflation rate is lower, maybe services inflation actually is lower and it's just because
the VLS is looking at lagging indicators it hasn't cut up yet? No, but it is right. Yes, our number is
lower but the cause of the stickiness of inflation is the services element. That is partly, as you
pointed out earlier, is driven by the tight labor market. Whether that's wage inflation, whether
that's unemployment rate, I'm of the opinion that the reason why the unemployment rate is so low
is more driven by people needing to find two jobs rather than one. That combined with
wages increasing, in part because unionized labors renegotiating their contracts
is fueling an increase in those numbers. I think the services element in particular,
if you look at healthcare, you look at other services that are involved around household care,
you look at household securities, you look at operational aspects, you look at food services,
these elements are seeing a significant increase and even yesterday you saw Domino's Pizzas,
yesterday before, Domino's Pizzas announced they're increasing their prices at the stores
as well and we're going to see more and more of these activities coming out because the cost of
labor is increasing. Okay, so I guess first off, where are we on inflation? What is true
inflation's latest reading?
As of today, it is on the 28th of February, it is at 1.87%. It is beneath that 2%
target. We have seen inflation numbers drop in the month of January and quite considerably
due to the post festive blues, so to speak, of November and December and the holiday season
where retailers, in particular retailers, have been looking to reduce the inventory levels so
that an increased number of promotional activities, discounting and so forth has been very prevalent.
That's also followed through in the retail sales numbers that were released in January by
the Census Department and so we're seeing those trends coming through in our data but now we're
starting to see prices creep up again because those discounting elements are coming out and
prices are increasing again and that's certainly what we had forecasted and what we're expecting
given historical trends and historical behaviors and in the marketplace that we're living in and
the conditions that we're in, in other words, high labor costs driving services up and the price of
goods and retailers as they reduce their inventory levels and they get rid of the
old stock and they put in the new stock and especially in apparel but also in food and other
categories, that number is going to be slowly coming up and that's what we're seeing.
Maybe you've already just answered this but let me see if I can jump to the punchline here on
inflation which is 1.87, I think is what you said. So that's below the Fed's objective. So
if we were using true inflation as the meter, the Fed could say, "Hey, mission accomplished, right?
We're done." And while there are a lot of people warning that inflation
might prove stickier to tame and again if the Fed pivots too soon and inflation isn't fully
out of the system and there's all this deficit spending going on and there are these continued
wage renegotiations by the unions and whatnot, there are people out there saying, "Hey,
maybe the inflation fight's not over and we got to be really vigilant." There are other people who
come on this channel and say, "Look, we still haven't felt the full force of all the lag effects
from all the rate hikes that have gone on and the quantitative tightening and those are going
to hit at some point in time and we've got this massive debt overhang and all the corporate
companies are going to be hitting the maturity walls really kind of starting now." And so some
people are saying, "Hey, look, don't worry about inflation. Deflation is the bigger problem going
forward." And looking at a one handle on inflation, somebody might say, "Yeah, it's getting pretty low
and it wouldn't take very much to tip that into deflation if there was other recessionary forces
hitting." So the big question I'm leading up to here is what do you think at true
inflation we should be more worried about going forward? Sticky inflation or actually the economy
slowing too much? So let me start off by saying I think the economy has grown faster than anyone
expected in quarter four. It came in, everyone's expecting the two percent, it came in at three
percent. There's revisions that are going to come through with that number but it is a lot stronger
than we anticipated. You look at the retail sales numbers for January, it's a lot
lower than people expected. Yeah, they were a big disappointment. Yeah, exactly. I think it
was 0.8% down on the previous month and the market was only expecting it to be like 0.2%
down. And I think a lot of this is to do with the historical trend behaviors that we've seen
in the January sales. The January blues have always been pretty significant post the holiday
season. Now I think we are of the belief that the economy is strong at the moment, a lot stronger
than we all have thought at. Is it going to decline further as a result of the interest rates?
I don't know, I'll take that one as time goes by. But we're of the opinion that inflation is
not over yet. We think that inflation remains sticky and in fact there is a worrying concern
if I look at our dates and try and project it forward, is I think the Fed is in a very tough
spot right now. In a sense that I think they have come out and clearly said, okay, we've hit the
terminal rate, we're now going to look at coming down. When do we start the cuts? And everyone's
questioning, when is the next rate cut? Is it going to be in the March meeting? Is it
going to be in May? Is it going to be in June? When is the next cuts? And I think our concern
with that is, well, the economy is growing strong, so the Fed is in a situation where it's saying,
we can cut it when we feel we're ready to cut it to boost economic development. And given the
economic strength of the US economy at the moment, they're in that situation that they probably want
to be in, which says, we can cut it when we are ready to cut it and when we need to cut it.
I think that the flip side of this is what's concerning us, is that if you tend to cut the
interest rates too fast, so do they do 50 basis points? Do they do 75 basis points? Or are they
going to stick to 25 basis points? It could have a reverse effect on the increase in pricing. We're
already starting to see prices creep up again. And if you reduce that, especially on the net effect
that it has on housing with mortgage rates coming down, and then repurchasing as the supply in the
housing market remains tight, that will fuel then prices to increase again. And given the fact that
in the BLS numbers, the housing or shelter accounts are nearly 40% of the total expenditure,
it is quite a significant concern if that drops too fast, because then the 30-year fix or 15-year
fix is going to come down considerably. And so that is a worry for us. And if you're in the Fed's
point of view, if you're in the Fed's position there, they can't increase interest rates at
the moment, or even if they had to, and if they did, I don't know how they do it. So they're in
a position they're quite in a quandary at the moment, because we're of the opinion that interest
rates, that inflation, sorry, is going to be increasing over time before it starts to really
have a systemic effect on this. And the other factor to consider here is also the impact of
onshoring, looking at the energy, the innovation rates of the innovative green energy resources
being invested onshore, import tariffs causing people to develop more onshore in the US,
which is increasing cost basis. And that naturally is going to over a period of time,
is going to have an impact on prices that we as consumers pay for. And that's the bigger concern
that's sitting on a systemic level for the long term fight on inflation. So we don't believe
inflation is over. And we think it's gonna remain sticky before it really starts to come down.
Okay, and just in that last point there, because of reshoring, it's basically just a secular
increase in the labor input costs to more goods. We benefited from cheap foreign labor,
we're now taking some material percentage of that back home where you have to pay more in salaries
and benefits and all that type of stuff. So just stuff's going to get more expensive going forward
just because of that alone. Yeah, 100%, right? You think of the impact that China had on
deflation or in the world that we lived in the last 20 years, they've had a huge impact on
deflationary prices. And I think the state of the US, the state of the China economy,
the relations between the US and China and the import duties of existing and onshore requirements,
it's having a reverse effect of that. Okay, so there's a lot of people watching who are
saying, "Dang, I was hoping the beatings were going to light up a little bit," but you're
basically saying, "No, not quite. They're going to continue for some period of time. Maybe not at 9%
like we saw a year and a half ago, but we're not entering into a comfort zone around inflation."
Okay, so let me just ask you this. How historically important in the inflation story
was the post-pandemic response era, where we had massive cost push inflation by supply chains
breaking all over the world, and we had massive stimulus stimulating demand. On a scale of one to
10, how impactful was that to the inflation that we experienced? And going forward,
how long will we continue to experience the shock waves from that?
Look, I think it's pretty unprecedented what we've gone through in the last four years.
I think if you look at just inflation alone, we saw 2020, 2021, early 2022, we saw very much
it being a supply-driven inflationary market. As you said, supply constraints in the Ukraine war
didn't help that either. A lot of supply constraints fueled the rise of inflation.
Then the sort of revenge spending came in with influx of expenditure for consumers.
But that was fueled by trillions in direct relief.
100%. And now that's sort of being normalized a bit. Now with wage inflation increasing,
right? So wages are going up. The worry I have is that revenge spending that's fueled by the
release that you mentioned. When does that start to impact, if any, on delinquency rates?
And so if you look at credit card delinquency rates, they're slowly creeping up again,
they're above the averages, and they're below where we were in the noughties, in the 2000s.
But they are significantly higher than they have been throughout the whole 10s. And I think that's
starting to be something that one needs to keep an eye out and see how that progresses over time
because the interest rates or the APRs that people are paying on those credit card loans, which have
now exceeded over a trillion dollars, should be of a concern, especially the delinquency rates
increasing. Alright, well let me add on to that then. So you talked about revenge spending,
which was, "Hey, I've been cooped up and I've still got some money in my pocket from the
stimulus. I'm going to go out and have a good time." Now there's this, have you heard of this term
doom spending? Which is people are, because of the increase in cost of living, and for most people,
wages have not caught up with the inflation rate that we've seen. I hold a stab on this,
it's 64% or 68% of Americans, I can't remember exactly which, are saying that, "Hey, my wages
have not kept up with the cost of inflation." And so people are beginning to feel, an increasing
number of people are beginning to feel a lot of financial stress and beginning to feel like maybe
they're hanging on by their fingernails and about to let go. And so there's this term doom spending
where they're like, "Well, if the future's not going to be fun, I may as well treat myself to
something today, before I have to go into that bleaker future." So if you think that inflation
is not fully tamed and is going to be sticky for a while, and have some secular wins behind it,
like the higher labor from reshoring, like you talked about, how concerned are you that
more and more, a greater percentage of the populace is not going to be able to keep up and
is going to be increasingly falling into more dire economic times? You talked about delinquency rates
going up, you kind of referenced it in the context of revenge spending, but you add doom spending
into that where it's kind of like the last hurrah. You've got to imagine what follows the last hurrah
is increased delinquencies. Yeah, so if you look at the aggregated inflation impact
back from 2020 to today, it's roughly around a 24% increase. That's what we're talking about.
And that's a significant volume impact on consumers expenditure. And I 100% agree with you,
if you look at the impact of wage increases over that period of time, you're nowhere near that. So
wages have not kept up with it. And the US consumers have become worse off. There's no
question around this. I think in the last year or so, I think it's since the summer of last year,
we are starting to see wages outstrip inflation. And so there is some relief coming into this
equation. But I am extremely worried about how this continues on about the doomsday spending
and how consumers are looking for some sort of gratification expenditure amongst all the
depressing news. But on the flip side of it, though, is the stock markets are pretty active
and they're doing very well. Bitcoin, if you look at the crypto world, the Bitcoin is down to the
up an all time high. S&P is again growing as it was versus a year ago, start of the year well.
And they have mixed reactions. But overall, I am concerned about how this affects the consumers
with the increase in inflation. And as much as inflation is under control, yes, we're saying it's
a 2%, whether it's a 3%, whether it's 2%. I'm less concerned about what the physical number is.
It is still on top of a very high number that was around 9% last year. So if we think that
number, the prices are coming down, they're not. It's still an increase happening every year.
And we are not seeing wages recovering that increase in prices that the consumers have
experienced. And hence why one of the things that we're looking at very closely is things
like delinquency rates and the delinquency rates and credit cards are up now to 3.2%. It has been
a constant increase all the way since the middle of 2021. The delinquency rates have
been increasing quarter on quarter on quarter. And that is a concern for us.
Okay, so a couple of things. It worries me that you're worried only because this is
something I worry an awful lot about and I talk about a lot on this channel, which is
sort of the plight of the average person, certainly the working and middle class.
So you mentioned there, hey, the stock market's up though and so is Bitcoin.
True. And that does have some wealth effect that may help the situation a little bit. But as I
mentioned an awful lot, financial assets are not evenly distributed across society. They are highly
concentrated in the top 10% of households. So the stock market going up in some ways kind of makes
the situation worse because it makes the average person just say, "Well, I'm just getting screwed
even more. The rich people are getting rescued because they own those assets and I'm just stuck
with the higher cost of living and wages that aren't keeping up and I'm just getting the shaft
here." And I don't know about you, but I don't know too many average people who if I'd gone to
at January 1st, 2020 and said, "Hey, your cost of living is going to go up by 24% in the next four
years," I don't know many that would have said, "Oh, that's fine." I think most would have said,
"That'd be game over. I'm living paycheck to paycheck as it is." So that's a massive injury
that the household balance sheet has taken or the household income statement has taken.
And honestly, I don't know how many of those people are going to make it
long term on this because we had all these things that were keeping them afloat, the stimulus, the
forbearances on many different things that are now all getting pulled apart. And to your part,
if inflation actually keeps grinding higher from here, albeit at a slower rate, it's not riding
these people's rescue. So where I'm going with all this is in the States, we have an election
coming up in November. Given where you see inflation, we all remember back to the Clinton
campaign, it's the economy stupid. Right now, immigration is a big topic. I think it's
currently the topic in the number one slot in the polls, but I wonder if that's not going to get
supplanted by the economy as we get closer to the election because generally people tend to vote
by how their wallet's feeling when they actually enter the election booth. How big of a factor do
you think this pension cost of living is going to play in November? I think it's going to be a
significant factor. I think if you look at, you're 100% right, all the subsidies that the government
has been spending on will slowly be reduced over time, so that subsidies is going to come off.
I think you've got additional impacts, the student loans, which I think are over a trillion dollars,
that needs to get repaid and repayment cycles on that. And that's going to put additional
pinch on the consumers, let alone the consequential impacts of inflation and the fact that wages
haven't kept up with that. When I look at the marketplace, I look at the unemployment rate,
I love the belief that as much as I see Levi's and other companies announcing that they can reduce
their headcounts, I think those that are reducing those headcounts are, as you say, more of the top
end of the marketplace rather than the working class that's driving this economy, that has driven
this economy over the decades in the history. And so my concern here is, I think people are
taking double jobs just to pay off their bills. And this is going to be an increasing impact on
a topic for the election. I think the Biden administration is going to continue on saying,
we've grown economic growth, the stock market's up, it's all gangbusters. And of course, the
Republicans are going to come into play and say, look, there's a lot more factors at play here
that's making it tougher for you and we need to rebuild the US economy again. So I think it's
going to be a big factor as it comes closer and closer to November, but I think I'm more worried
about what happens now and then and seeing how do we help the consumers deal with these
increase in pricings and the consequential impacts it has. Okay, I want to just get your
thoughts on this. I'm not saying this is going to happen. I will say there's possibility of
this happening, but I'm not saying it's going to happen. We've seen layoffs happen all
through 2023 at almost twice the rate in 2022. We've seen layoffs really pick up here at the
beginning of 2024. And I mentioned this corporate debt maturity wall that companies are finally
hitting, where their debt has to get refinanced and it's generally getting refinanced at a rate
that's like 2X of the debt they've currently had on their books. So if they're not an AI-driven
wonder company, most companies are having to go into cost cutting mode. So let's say that
layoffs continue from here and let's say they actually start really jumping up.
If we start having sort of recession entry-level job losses, again, not predicting they're
going to happen, but just if we did, what impact, if any, would that have to your inflation outlook?
Considerably. I think it would have a huge impact on wages overall. It would have a huge impact on
abilities for people to repay their loans from an individual perspective, let alone from a corporate
and from a government perspective. So net-net, it would have a significant impact. And if you look
at trajectories in the past, if inflation for inflation to be structurally under control,
unemployment needs to raise and it hasn't risen yet. So the inroads that the monetary policy has
had an impact on, I think has probably gone as far as it can do, maybe a bit further, but the
underlying structural impact needs to be addressed. And I think the unemployment were to
increase, I think that have a massive impact, consequential impact on inflation. Would you
expect to see inflation perhaps go negative just given that we're already below the two percent
bound right now? Were that to happen or do you think for structural reasons it would still stay
positive? Yeah, I think in the in a direct short term, I think we will see with we're opposite
belief that inflation is going to stay positive. I think if you look at more the mid to long term
with the impact of AI and the automation elements, it's coming to play. I think then you probably
might see it getting very close to zero percent in our numbers, but a lot of that has a lot to
do with also the inventory levels and promotions and discounts and pricing levels and a whole bunch
of factors are coming to play. But I also am worried about the geopolitical risks, which
mean that prices probably won't come down as fast as we'd like, especially given the current
conflicts in the Middle East, around the Red Sea, with Israel. How does that impact on the prices
of oil? And oil prices have been starting to go up a bit again. Every increase of oil price is 50%
that is reflected on the increase of oil, of petrol or gas at the gas tanks. So there is direct
correlations and it's not a lag effect. It's pretty rapid impact on the prices of petrol
or gas. So net-net, short term, I'm of the belief that we're not going to get into a deflation
environment, but I think medium to long term there is a possibility, but the geopolitical aspect of
it also needs to come under control. Got it. What I'm getting from you is right now, if there's
something that keeps you up at night, it's higher inflation, not lower inflation, but that could
change for many of the reasons we're talking about. All right, I'm getting up to a big question, but
real quick before I get there, I'm just curious if you have anything to say on housing. So I know
you said earlier that it sounds like your measurement of home price or housing's
contribution to the true inflation number is weaker than what the BLS is currently showing.
I guess the question I want to ask you is, is there hope on the horizon for aspiring home buyers
or not? And one of the questions that I don't necessarily expect to have the answer to,
but we've had this tremendous increase in the cost of home ownership, meaning it's a lot more
expensive to finance a home now because mortgage rates have gone up so much, but also all the
associated costs with home ownership have gone up. Maintenance is a lot more expensive now.
Contractors are a lot more expensive. Input costs are a lot more expensive,
but a lot of people have been scratching their heads saying, "Wow, the cost of a house has gone
up," but average prices haven't gone down in the country. Yes, there are some markets that have
started to cool off and whatnot, but normally there's a seesaw relationship between cost of
ownership and prices. We've seen cost of ownership go up, but we haven't seen prices adjust for that.
So are you seeing something different in your tools or no?
No, I think the biggest concern we've got on the housing market, and I'm generally talking about
the housing market, not necessarily our metric, but we're seeing it through the metrics that we're
reporting, is the supply. If you look at new supply coming onto the market versus existing
supply that's in the market, the number of new supply coming to the market of new properties is
not significant. It is increasing, there is more supply coming on, but it's not at a significant
volume that's going to bring pricing down. I think the second element is on an existing supply in the
marketplace. People are not moving because they don't want to buy. Normally in the past,
we have seen people move from A to B for work purposes, for educational purposes, whatever,
and people have switched out their current mortgage and the current brand of solar and
purchase a new property. People don't want to do that, exactly as you mentioned, because
a higher cost not only is the cost of the property more expensive, but for the same price I'm buying
today, I'm basically getting one less room. One less room is equivalent to what you're getting
today. If you look at that and you say, "Okay, I've got to pay a higher property tax, I've got
a high maintenance cost and there's no availability and why should I move?" The movement of labour,
the lack of movement of labour, the lack of supply in the marketplace, I think we will start to see
some prices hold relatively stable, but I think it's going to go up again. That's the worry I
have. I mentioned right earlier, as soon as the interest rates come down, therefore the mortgage
rates are going to come down, people might shift then and the cost of new housing is going to go up
again and that's the biggest concern that we've got. So you're maybe making current homeowners
feel better but dashing the hopes of aspiring buyers. I'll point out the irony in this world
where, for whatever reason, cost of ownership goes up, price doesn't come down like it should,
cost of ownership goes down in the future like you think it might happen if mortgage rates go down,
prices go up. No matter what happens, it's only bullish for home prices.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I think that's what keeps me awake. This is the stuff that
I find worrying and I think you're right in saying it's going to be topics
that the electorate is going to vote with and vote on. Alright, I didn't mean to get here,
but I'm going to get here just because we go here, just because we talked about it.
One can make the argument that we are kind of bifurcating as an economy where
the existing rich continue to do better and everybody else just gets squeezed more and more
here. Housing is a great example. We're at record levels of unaffordability in homes. I saw some
staff that I think it said in a survey of close to 600 counties in the US and in 99% of them,
the median price of a house there was unaffordable to the average income earner.
And so we're entering this world where basically like, hey, if you want the American dream,
you got to kind of already be born wealthy or you're kind of out of luck. The brass ring has
moved far enough from you at this point that if you don't have some advantage, you're probably
not going to get it. As you continue to look at rising inflation and whatnot, I'm
kind of picking up the vibe that you have sort of a similar concern about that, but am I being
too dire here or is that where the puck is headed at current status quo trajectories?
No, I think your home said right and I think the biggest concern I've got in that is I look at this
on a very macro picture. The Pew research put out an article or some work out, they put out some
fantastic work around the erosion of the middle class and if you look at the last 40 years,
we have really seen erosion of the middle class. I think it's dropped from like 62%
of the US economy down to now something like 55. I think it's 55% of the US economy or the
US population is now considered middle class and that gap of the erosion of the middle class,
I can guarantee is not going upwards, it's going the other way. You could argue that potentially
maybe because as you already pointed out, it could be immigration policies, it could be a whole bunch
of factors, but if the middle class is declining and the wealthier are getting wealthier,
what has been the working horse of the US economy since the Second World War has been the working
class population and if that's eroding, I don't know what that means for the longer term. So,
there needs to be an equilibrium here, there needs to be a rebalancing and for me, those are the big
macro pictures and onshore I think could help on that, but that would mean that in the short term,
there will be, well, short this term, there will be an impact on pricing, but it certainly will
bring jobs back to the US and bring innovation back to the US which I think is important
because innovation is what fuels growth and we need that innovation.
Okay, and I agree with that. I actually am a fan of onshoring knowing that it will be increasing
cost structure but hopefully it'll also be increasing wages for those people at the same
time. I don't have time to get into this but one resource that you should be aware
of if you're not already, are the charts that Chris Hamilton produces at Economica and if that
name doesn't, if it's not familiar to you Oliver, I'm sure you'll notice the charts, you recognize
the charts if you see them, but Chris tracks an awful lot of things. He's a chartist but
demographics is one that he spends a lot of time charting and I had him on the program not that
long ago and he basically showed the projections for US population and they're pretty frightening
from a national demographic standpoint, but the really key one there is that the cohort
that drives economic growth, 25 to 54 year olds, on an absolute level, that cohort is
already in population decline. So adding the wealth gap and inequality element
to it just makes it even worse, but for a guy in your job who's trying to predict where inflation's
going, it's hard to actually get sustainable inflation unless you're just
killing the currency with bad monetary policy, which we're going to talk about in a second.
It's hard to get that sort of sustained secular inflation if your percentage of workers, of
able-bodied active workers is in a secular decline. But anyways, a different story for a different day.
Last big question I want to ask you and I just tipped my cards there. So we've been talking
about inflation in the course of this conversation as things becoming more
expensive, household budgets getting pinched. Let's talk about it in the context of just loss
of purchasing power. So what is your outlook on the purchasing power of the dollar
and I guess any other fiat currencies, if you want to mention them as well, but
I think the big issue for folks are not only having a challenge saving, given the increase
in cost of living rising faster than their wages, whatever they have left over, if they have anything
left over, the purchasing power of that is getting less and less and less.
Yeah, I do think though that there is a sort of a bit of a bright light at the
end of the tunnel on this topic. I think that is twofold. One is wage increases need to
continue going up and that has to increase. I think the days of us offshoring
work to bring deflationary market conditions to the US with the economic growth of China,
they're over. They can still contribute a bit I think, but this notion of bringing onshoring
will help. Yes, I think there'll be a price pinch to the consumers that we spoke about earlier in
the short term, but I think in the long term we're going to see wages increase and that also
comes with increased innovation rates and education levels. So I'm of the conviction
that in the long term we're going to have to adapt and evolve and innovate and
recapture the lead of that as we go forward in more of a medium to longer term outlook.
Okay, and I can see that argument sort of resulting in more robust economic
growth and maybe some pessimists are looking at right now. I'm just curious about your thoughts
about the purchasing power of the currency going forward. So people might make more of the dollars
and maybe they're getting devalued but you're making more and it's equilibrating.
I will say we have a lot of people watching this program who are worried about the future
purchasing power of the dollar, so I want to get a sense for if you are as well and if you are then
the follow-up question is what strategies, if any, do you think are worth considering to preserve
purchasing power going forward? Short answer is yes. I am worried about it and I think
it's about a diversification that is required. The question really is on the U.S. dollar
is what is the impact of the U.S. on the global scale? And yes, the U.S. currency
as such is actually probably still and I think in a short to medium term it will still be the
biggest currency in the market, in the world economy and if you think about the number of
hundred dollar bills that are outside the U.S. in circulation, it's quite a considerable
number. I don't have the exact stats on that but I think it's right. I've had Brent Johnson on here
and he's talked about the dollar milkshake theory, so this audience is familiar with the euro dollar
market and all that stuff. I am concerned about it but I do have faith that
we need to diversify in the short term but I think in the long term I think I got faith that
things will rebalance and we'll see a strength coming back but I don't think it's gonna go away.
I just think the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar is too strong in the world that we live in.
Okay and just because I know folks are going to ask in the comments, are there any particular
assets or strategies, some would say own gold, some would say own land, some would say own
Bitcoin, some would say own stocks. They tend to do really well in periods of inflation.
So any particular commentary on that? I mean you're not a market analyst, a financial
market analyst more as you are a inflation analyst, so I don't want to push you out of
your comfort zone but if you have anything to say, I know folks would be interested.
Okay, I've been very caged in my response to the last question for that exact reason.
I know other people will know more than I do
on this topic and I'll probably defer to them but for me personally, I've been looking much
more into the real world assets, the crypto world to diversify. Yes, it's more volatile but I think
it gives us an ability to invest in different things than what we have in the past. Everyone
is invested in equities, everyone's invested in bonds. I think the bond market has been a good
market to have in the past going forward, less so potentially. As I said, I'm not the expert in this
but I've been diversifying investments considerably and I've been focused very much on the crypto
world and real world assets and trying to find ways to find new areas to fuel growth and innovation
is coming from that world at the moment and this is where I think innovation is really needed to
fuel growth, whether it's the EV battery markets for EV cars, whether it's solar energy, whatever
else it is. If we don't, the US economy needs to find that edge, that innovating gain that will
fuel a new set of economy and it's about investing in that. I think right now the crypto world
has been leading the way in that a bit and so I've gone down that route, whether it's the right way
or not, I don't know but the price points of Bitcoin right now are nearly an all-time high and
there's still more optimism to see how the markets in the crypto world evolve over the time period.
Okay, all right. Thank you. Two last questions for you. First one, very important. For folks
that have really enjoyed this discussion, would like to follow you and your work and Trueflation,
where should they go? Yeah, so obviously, first of all, look at our website trueflation.com.
You can also look us up on Telegram, on Twitter, it's all @trueflation. For me personally, reach
out. I'm on Twitter, I'm on LinkedIn or you can just reach out to me at oliver@trueflation.com
but feel free to look at our website. There's a lot of materials there and if there's any
questions you have that you want to talk about, please do reach out. All right, fantastic. Thank
you and Oliver, when I edit this, I will put up the links to those resources on the screen. Folks,
I'll also put links in the description below the video too if you just want one click access to
those. All right, so in about 60 seconds, I'm going to ask you the second question, Oliver,
which is, "Hey, we've been talking about sort of money related topics, all conversation. I'd love
to get a sense for one non-money related investment you would encourage folks to adopt in their lives."
Real quick before I do, I just have a little bit of housekeeping to do so you can think of your
answer in the interim there, Oliver. Folks, well, first off, if you've enjoyed this conversation
with Oliver, would like to see him come back on in the future when he may see a trend change or
anything going on in the inflation rate that he thinks is worthy of us knowing about, please vote
your support for that by hitting the like button, then clicking on the red subscribe button below,
as well as that little bell icon right next to it. I also just want to deliver another reminder that
if you're watching this the day it goes out on Thursday, you have only until tomorrow night,
Friday night, midnight, to lock in the lowest early bird price for the upcoming Thoughtful
Money online conference on Saturday, March 16th. As a reminder, if you can't watch it live, and a
lot of people can't just because of life and weekends sometimes can be tough, don't worry.
Everybody who signs up for it is going to get replay videos of all the presentations, as well
as all the live Q&A sessions within 24 hours of the event's end. Again, just a reminder, if you
are a premium subscriber to our sub stack, you'll get an additional $50 off the conference by using
the discount code that's been sent to all the premium subscribers. Also, just a note too,
just locked in Danielle Park as another speaker for the conference and folks, you may remember
her, just had her on for the first time a couple weeks ago. Folks really loved her commentary and
so I wanted to pull her into the conference. So now we've got both Danielle's. We've got Danielle
Park and Danielle at the Martina booth. We've cornered the markets on Danielle's for the
conference. And then just a reminder, as I say every week with the financial advisors on this
channel, your number one goal as an investor here is to be managing your wealth to basically meet
or exceed the rate of inflation. That really should be your primary objective for wealth
building and investing. That's the time-honored way to basically build and preserve your wealth
over time is just to make sure that you're putting together a strategy that doesn't get beaten by the
inflation demon. If you've got a good professional financial advisor who understands that, gets all
the issues that Oliver and I have talked about, as well as all the other folks that come on this
channel every week, great, stick with them. But if you don't have a good financial quarterback who's
doing that for you, or you'd like in a second opinion from one who does, then feel free to
schedule a free consultation with one of the advisors that Thoughtful Money endorses. To do
that, just fill out the short form at ThoughtfulMoney.com. These consultations are totally free.
There's no commitment to work with these advisors and these are the same advisors you see with me on
this channel week after week after week. It's just a free public service they offer to help as many
people as possible positioned as prudently as possible not to have their wealth eaten up by
inflation. All right, Oliver, thanks for your patience there. We're at that final question here.
What non-money related investment we do encourage folks to consider?
It's an interesting question. For me, it's all been around learning and constant learning and
understanding different people's point of views and different cultures. I think that gives people,
it gives me certainly a new perspective on things. There's always a different viewpoint,
there's a different angle and I think we as consumers and individuals are quick to jump
to a conclusion. I think it's important to have a perspective, an alternative perspective
on life, on viewpoints and on cultures and how that changes everything and so I just encourage
everyone to be on the mindset of willingness of continuing to learn. It's a great answer.
I would echo that not just on the continuing to learn but the continuing to seek out alternative
points of view because it's so easy in today's digital media world to create our own echo
chambers of sources that we just like hearing because they agree with our inherent biases,
getting exposure to other ways of thinking, other points of view, other cultures like you said,
other lenses through which to see the world. Super helpful in making sure that we are making
truly informed decisions and not just again like reaffirming our own biases and I say that as a guy
with my own media channel here. I highly encourage people to watch and consume
other media from other different sources particularly those that have a different
point of view and I try to chart as impartial a course as I can but highly recommend that people,
again, I try to pick a pretty independent moderate course. I would encourage people to
go find something on the more conservative side and go find something more on the progressive
side and see if there's other bits out there that enrich your ability to see the larger
picture. So anyways, Andrew, I appreciate that. I appreciate you saying that as a man who is
up past midnight over in Asia right now having stayed up to do this, so you're walking your talk.
Yeah, thanks a lot. I love it. I think it's wielding and it's impactful on oneself as
well as on others just to learn something new and look at something through, as you said,
through a different lens but it's an experience. I live for those experiences and so the more and
more I can be challenged, I love it. So that's also what gets me into this economic data aspect
with inflation measurement because everyone's got a point of view and it's great to hear those.
No matter where they live. Yeah, exactly. This has been wonderful. Thank you so much. Like I said,
love to have you back on the program whenever your models there are telling you there's something
important that we all need to know. Everybody else, thanks so much for watching. Thanks a lot.
Bye.
