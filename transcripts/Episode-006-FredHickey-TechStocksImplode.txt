Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. Heading into 2024,
we may be witnessing a change in a number of trends. The October CPI numbers suggest
inflation is moderating faster than expected. If that proves true, this may mean the Federal
Reserve's aggressive campaign of hiking interest rates is over, and if that's true, the three-year
beating the bond market has suffered may be coming to an end. As for stocks, they've been powered
higher all year by the magnificent seven, but even there we may be witnessing a regime change.
To clarify whether these are indeed real and significant trend shifts, we're fortunate today
to speak with Fred Hickey, editor of the highly respected newsletter The High-Tech Strategist,
which Fred's been publishing since 1987. Fred, thanks so much for joining us today.
Always my pleasure.
Well, a pleasure to have you back here on the new channel. Fred, you're one of the very first
guests. I can't think of anybody better to kick this new channel off with, so thank you for making
the time to join us here. Lots of questions for you, lots of new news to react to. Very quickly,
though, just to set the context before we get into the details, a general question for you.
What's your current assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
Well, it's a lot worse than what the consensus is right now. Internationally, I think major parts of
the economy are in recession already. Certainly that's the case in China and also in the case
in parts of Europe. Germany is in recession. Largest countries in Europe are in recession.
France is following it. And then you have the US, which, you know, last quarter showed a 4.9 percent
GDP number, but the latest Atlanta Fed fracker is 2 percent. I think the economy is a lot worse than
some of the headline, that 4.9 percent number, GDP number shows. You can start with consumer spending,
which is 70 percent of the economy. And we have a lot of data that's come in, including Home Depot
this morning, a lot of data. But Home Depot once again came out and said that their sales are down.
They're expecting 3 to 4 percent decline. Obviously, they're being hurt by housing because
housing is in a deep recession, given that rates have soared there. We're talking about 7.5 percent
mortgages versus 3-plus before. So housing, which leads the economy usually, is in a dark place.
Mortgage applications a week or two ago went to 28-year low. Existing home sales are down to a
13-year low. We've seen a drop off in industrial production. And I was going to say, in consumer,
we just had a great report come out yesterday. It's a new one from the National Retail Federation
that instead of, like, the government tracks or does a survey and they'll have that report this
week. This one actually tracks transactions. So 1,400 institutions, financial institutions,
500 billion dollars of sales, 9 billion credit and debit transactions. So it's accurate data,
not survey data. And there they showed a decline in retail sales in the month of October,
month over month. And it's been slipping now since April. Bank of America had a similar report out
last week and they showed also a 0.5 percent year-over-year decline in retail sales.
So consumer sentiment was out last Friday. University of Michigan, that was a 5 percent
decline to 60 percent. That's showing, that was fourth straight month of decline. So retail sales
are weakening. There isn't any doubt about that. And of course, when you raise rates as much as
the Fed has, starting in 2022, it was going to have an impact. And it is having an impact,
but it's maybe slower than some expected, including myself.
Just on that point, because you're hitting on my favorite topic here, which is the lag effect.
You know, you're essentially saying it acts with a lag and this lag is taking longer than
many folks, perhaps even yourself, expected. I'm just curious, I'm just asking you to guess here,
how much of the lag effect has expressed itself to date?
Well, when I was on this show some months ago, I said that I thought we would head into recession
here at the end of the year into 2024, but it could be extended out if the Fed
acted. And shortly after that, well, at the time, the Fed's balance sheet was 8.3 billion.
They had taken it down via QT from 8.9, I should say trillion. The billions and trillions can get
confusing. 8.9 trillion down to 8.2 trillion. It was 8.3 when we spoke. And then over the next
few weeks, they took it up by $700 billion. They injected money to combat the banking,
the regional banking crisis. And that helped extend everything out. We had that huge surge
in money that came into the system. And that caused the lag to be longer, I think, than
would have occurred had the Fed not. And that's what I warned about. If they did that,
then they could extend everything out. But I think now things are turning down. And I don't know,
I don't think the Fed can act again right now. Well, you just saw, as I mentioned,
the University of Michigan, they also have an inflation expectations component. And that came
out on Friday. And that went up for the next year from 4.2% to 4.4%. And long-term inflation
expectations also rose from 3 to 3.2%. And when that happened, all the Fed members, all the
governors came out and sang from the same hymnal and said, "Higher for longer, and we might have to
raise rates." So I don't think you're going to have, you're going to see rate cuts as soon as
some of the market would hope because there are inflation expectations, a big part of inflation,
but you also have the Atlanta Fed wage tracker up to 5.2%. Today's CPI report still shows 4%
inflation, excluding food and energy is 3+% in the headline. That's still much higher than the
Fed wants. So I don't think the Fed can come in and save the day. And the erosion effects of these
higher rates of QT, because now the Fed has taken their balance sheet back down and reversed that
700 billion plus some. So we've gone from 8.9 trillion to 7.8 trillion right now. That's a big
1.1 trillion dollar decline and it's dropping by 90 billion dollars a month. So the tightening
continues and all these companies that used to borrow at half the rate they can borrow at today,
now it's 10% in many cases or higher if it's a junk bond. When they go to refinance, their
interest cost goes way up and it's causing companies like WeWork last week, it was a very
large company, has a large real estate footprint for that company to go bankrupt. So we're going to
see these kinds of erosionary effects. It's all lag, but it's still happening.
Great. So you're taking this exactly where I wanted to, and I'm going to ask my question in
a slightly different way, which is the lag effect is the Fed takes action, but it takes a while for
the impact of that action to manifest in the real economy. And right now the Fed has been trying
with its rate hike campaign and QT to slow the economy. So it's increasing the gravitational
force pulling economic growth down. So as you're saying, there are all these reasons, especially
the longer we stay higher and higher for longer, the more that force of gravity is going to start
just pulling everything down with it. And one of the problems with the lag effect is that their
numbers lag. So everyone looks and they look at, you see GDP at 4.9%. Well, I don't think we're
going at 4.9%. Right. It doesn't reflect where we are today. Yeah, exactly. Right. And so that's
why you have a lag effect. I mean, you have in the jobs area, you've seen some growth there in jobs.
Well, actually the jobless rate has gone up from almost a half a percent now to 3.9%,
but they're still showing job strong jobs growth. Well, last month's numbers was all due to birth
death, birth death, 414,000 jobs. Those are phantom jobs. It's just monkeying with an
Excel spreadsheet, right? Well, no, I won't say they're monkeying it. It's their methodology.
What happens is that when they add or subtract these jobs, depending on what their
forecasts are, where they think the economy is, well, if we've been in an upturn, they add jobs.
They don't see the downturn, so they keep adding jobs, even though they're not really
adding jobs. So it was 414,000 and this has been going on. So the jobs numbers are all inflated.
And those are the things that they show, even though we do have an increase in the
unemployment rate happening. And there's a lot of other jobs related that temporary help
is declining. There are a lot of other items in the numbers that are showing that there is a
decline, but the headline, the big headline numbers are showing strong growth. And that's why a lot of
people in the stock market are calling it Goldilocks economy because they think the
economy is strong and it really isn't. >>So in many ways, we're kind of looking
at data that is flawed, right? So just to finish my question here, so lag effect,
we still have yet to see all of it. My question to you is how much has yet to manifest? And I'll
make it easy. Have we seen more than half of the impact yet or does more than half of the
lag effect impact lie ahead of us? Like how much lag effect should we be bracing for is kind of
what I'm trying to get to. >>Well, I think you're going to have a fairly deep recession
and we're only at the early stages of it here in the US. So I think it's pretty early on still
before you see the large jumps in the layoffs that will occur. Now, we're starting to see that job
cuts are increasing. The challenger numbers are up multi-month high here. And so we're seeing that,
but it's going to get a lot worse. We're not even half-time, I don't think, at this point.
>>Okay, not even half-time. That's exactly the general ballpark I was looking for. Okay. >>Right,
2024. Again, unless the Fed comes in and I don't think they can right now, unless they come in and
and try to extend this out again, I think we'll continue down into 2024. >>Okay, so then one
question on that is I want to tie it to the recent October CPI numbers that came out that you just
mentioned where they did surprise on the downside. They were less than folks expected. There's a
great chart I'll try to find in a moment here that ZeroHedge put up showing how the CPI tracks with
M2 with a delay. And if you look at where M2 has gone, it suggests that CPI is going to continue
going substantially lower even from here. And so this data may, well, the discussion this week is,
hey, this has put the nail in the coffin on the Fed's hiking regime, which means not that it's
going to cut anytime soon necessarily, but it's going to remain at this plateau higher for longer.
Now, history shows us very clearly when you look at the past recessions that we've had,
they've pretty much all followed an aggressive rate hike regime, then a plateau, and then the
recession kicks in and then the Fed is scrambling to lower rates and we have a multi-quarter,
sometimes multi-year, recessionary period that follows. Do you expect history to follow that
script this time around? Sounds like you do. >>It always does. The Fed's always wrong. They're
always backward looking and there's always a lag effect to their numbers and they're either too
tight for too long or they're too easy for too long. Lately, we've seen the too easy for too long
and most recently now they're tight and they remain tight because they do have these inflationary
effects that are going to stay with us. I think it would be very difficult to get it down to their
2% target. So they're going to keep this higher for longer. And yeah, so they'll keep it higher
for longer and those erosionary effects underneath the economy and corporations going bankrupt and
having to cut back and lay off people and all that kind of stuff will continue on.
So yeah. >>Okay, and as you've been talking, I put up the chart here which shows these peaks
where we have this plateau where the Fed has hung out, said, "Okay, we're done hiking, we're
going to stay here because this is the right place to be," and then all of a sudden they realize, "Oh
no, it's not the right place to be. We are way too tight," and then they scramble. So it sounds like
you're saying, "Yep, here at the end of this chart here with the peak with the question mark,
your experience makes you fairly confident that we're going to see the same cycle repeat."
>>Absolutely. It really never changes and I don't see it. Given the circumstances that we have today
where we can see the erosion of the economy yet the headline numbers kind of look strong,
they'll continue to tighten for two, well, they'll continue to be tight and of course they are still
tightening with QT at 90 billion dollars every month. So it's not just a pause here.
We have a pause in rate hikes at what are very high levels relative to what we have been when
you were at zero for over a decade. You go from zero to five and a quarter, five and a half percent
of the Fed funds and you jump rates as high as you did, not just mortgages but corporate loans,
everything. They're all up, they're all doubled. There are going to be severe effects because
companies and people borrowed record amounts of money. You saw credit card borrowing go to 1.8
trillion dollars up 16% year over year. Well, you're talking 21% rates there on credit cards.
>>The highest amount of outstanding credit card balance paired with the highest average APR on
credit cards. >>Right, ever. And so those effects, we're starting to see those in a slowdown in the
economy, a slowdown in retail sales and that will only continue. And then you can throw in, of
course, the student loans which have started to impact a significant percentage of the economy.
They have these loans and I saw where the average cost was $350 per month. That's
going to be taking out here in the fourth quarter. So it doesn't look good for Christmas sales here
at all. >>All right, so let's assume for a moment and showing my cards, I'm on the same page as you
are, Fred, but that the lag effect does tip the US into recession next year. And again, while a
lot of our cohorts globally are doing the same, thinking back to that chart that I just showed
there, that shows that in the past, the Fed has scrambled to reduce rates. Presumably when the
recession hits, if something hasn't broken before then, the Fed will probably stop QT, but tell me
if you disagree. And then secondly, it'll start cutting rates. We're up here at five and a quarter
ish. Again, I'm sort of forcing you to prognosticate a little bit here, but how
aggressive do you expect the Fed to be in bringing the federal funds rate down? As aggressive as we
seen in previous regimes? >>I think it depends on how badly the stock market's getting hit and if
there are, as you said, if there are any explosions that might occur like we saw in March. And
to that point, those regional banks have bigger problems today than they did back in March and the
amount of losses they're holding on their balance sheet. Now they have the new program, the BP,
BFTB or whatever it's called, that helps that where they're borrowing from. But if that
spreads and in recessions, that certainly could happen. And then you have some kind of a crisis,
then that will speed their actions up. So I think it's a stock market, the big decline of which we're
not having it right now, and certainly not today, or some kind of crisis in the banking system that
would speed everything up. Otherwise they'll be slow because of the trouble getting inflation
down. >>Got it. Okay. Well, let me read this and then let you run with your commentary.
This was said recently by a smart man, a smart man that I'm actually talking to right now.
Moody's cuts the US outlook to negative, citing deficits and political polarization late Friday
afternoon after the 310 and miserable 30-year auctions. We're heading to such a train wreck
and almost all investors are 100% clueless. What could go wrong? So when you say that the Fed's
actions are basically going to depend upon what we see happen in the markets, it does not sound like
you're very optimistic about what's going to happen in the markets next year. >>No, and what we didn't
talk about yet was the box that the Fed is in. We have the deficit. I was on this channel
seven months ago. The national debt was 31.5 trillion. It grew 2.2 trillion dollars in just
seven months. It's staggering numbers. The government's only paying 3% right now on average
on their debt. So that's going higher because Treasury Secretary Yellen is issuing as much
many bills as she can at five and a half percent. So that's going higher. We're already at a run
rate of one trillion dollars in an interest expense or over two, almost getting to three billion
dollars per day. So there's a huge problem here that the Fed has. They have to keep
funding this, all this spending that's going on, all these programs that the Biden
administration has started with, the CHIPS program, infrastructure, the inflation
reduction act. These are all major spending programs where spending continues to actually build
over the next few years. So now we have Moody's, which is finally after Fitch and S&P had
come in. Although Moody's hasn't downgraded, they just warned that they were in a negative
mode and they would probably downgrade the debt of the government. This is a big
problem and the market's not considering that at all right now. The cost of debt is too high,
interest expense, and there's no sense of any fiscal responsibility in Washington. They just
keep spending. So you could have a situation where rates, longer term rates, actually go up
when the Fed is trying to lower rates some point next year because of these dynamics.
The buyers, the traditional buyers of in the last several years, the largest holders were
the Fed itself, which is not buying. They're reversing, they're letting
bonds mature at 90 billion dollars in total for his reason and mortgage backs. So they're out of
the market. China has has dumped over the last several years from 500 billion dollars worth of
bonds and they're doing it at an accelerated pace. So it's gone from 1.3 trillion to 800 billion.
And the pace that they were running at now is 200 billion dollars a year. And I know they're going
to continue. I read comments from them. They're going to continue to dump. Japanese holders are
selling now and they are the current largest foreign holders. And what's making this up right
now, what's making up the difference is what they call the household category,
which is made up of people like me who did put short money into short term. I mean, five percent
plus is really good. So it's that trend that's injuring all those small, all the banks, right,
which is everyone's taking their money out. That's correct. And that could cause, that's part of,
along with their losses, which could cause further crisis. But also then you have this basis trade
that's going on where hedge funds are buying a lot, buying a huge, now we don't know exactly
how much, no one knows exactly how much, but we know it's levered. And, you know, just last week
I will read this comment from Lisa Cook, who is a Fed governor, talking about this basis trade.
Because the basis trade is highly leveraged, a funding shock or heightened volatility in
Treasury markets could force some hedge funds to abruptly unwind their positions at potentially
distressed prices. That's a Fed governor saying that. Now, the BIS, the Bureau, the bank,
the bankers to the bankers, the central bankers, want also a potential dislocation just
relatively recently. So we have big problems potentially here. You just can't, you just can't
keep spending like this and borrowing like this. You know, the great economist Herb Stein,
Stein, you know, said if something cannot go on forever, it won't, it'll stop. And that's what
also is out there. There are these big potentially huge problems that could come up and likely will.
I mean, we had the March Madness where the Fed had to come in. We saw that in England
not too long ago. And then the Fed has to react. That's usually what's been happening here over the
last multi-decades is that something happens that they don't anticipate and then they have
to come in again. All right. Well, let me ask you to opine on this, right? So we've got the Fed
pumping the brakes hard, right? Tightening QT rate hikes, right? Yet we've got the fiscal side,
right? We've got the Congress and the administration hitting the gas, right? And
I've talked about this a lot in the program. That's not sustainable, right? Just like if you
were in a car and you jammed your feet on both the accelerator and the brake, you'd basically
burn out the engine not too long of a time. How does that manifest? And I've asked this
question of a couple of different previous experts on the channel. I've kind of gotten
different answers. So I'm curious to hear what your thoughts are. Well, it could manifest itself
in higher long-term rates, and that would be a problem or higher than they would like to see.
And that may be part of what we've seen already is that the rates are high. The Fed stopped hiking
rates in July, and then longer-term rates went up another 100 basis points from there. Well,
that was the Fed. That was showing the Fed losing control a bit. Now, it might lose a lot more
control. You have all of these central banks that are, I mean, I should say the countries that are
dropping their bonds, well, their bond holdings here, well, that could cause a problem. And then
you could have a dollar decline. Right now, we don't know how large the carry trade is in Japan.
Some think it's enormous, but if Japan is forced to come off their yield control, the yen could,
after it's been declining significantly, could reverse, and the dollar could actually start to
decline. And I actually think that will happen here at some point. Inflation is rising in Japan,
and they're coming to the point where they're going to have to come off of that. So you could
see a dynamic with the dollar declines, too, which would lift inflation even higher here.
There's a whole bunch of different variables that could occur that would upset the apple cart.
Okay, it's such an interesting tangle here. So the market this week clearly thinks that the Fed
is done hiking and that the next action the Fed is going to take is a cut. Now, that cut might not
come till some point into 2024. We can argue about when. We can argue about what might trigger it.
But clearly, this week at least, the bond market is cheering this. It's had three years of declines,
at least with treasuries, unprecedented. And so I think bond investors are all of a
sudden maybe thinking like, oh my goodness, maybe the beatings just ended. Maybe we're poised to
have a good year next year. And of course, there's been a number of people on this channel who have
been arguing a long treasury bond trade, which would say at some point the Fed's going to be
done. And then either willingly or reluctantly, the Fed's going to have to bring down interest
rates in the way that we just talked about. That should actually be quite favorable for treasuries,
unless inflation remains really sticky and high and the vigilantes keep pushing up the
further end of the long end of the curve. I'm curious, what are your thoughts right
now on the long treasury trade? If we were in normal times where we didn't have these funding
issues or we didn't have this out of control spending, and if that was not the case, we were
just in a normal heading into a recessionary period, you would want to be buying hand over
fist long-term bonds right now. And it may be, we have seen rates come down here, it may be that we
will have a rally. However, the problem is that you do have this potential funding crisis, you do
have a potential dollar crisis, and that could shoot rates up the other way. So it's a possibility,
and you have to consider that possibility of that happening. So I'm mixed. Like I said,
normally you should be buying bonds, but this is a different environment. This is uncharted territory
that we're in right now. And so it makes me a little bit leery. I certainly wouldn't be
jumping in and buying these long-term bonds hand over fist at this point, because I do know that
there are these problems that could keep rates up. Okay. So there's too much risk in the system right
now. I believe for everything you've told us so far, those are all reasons why you're a fan of
gold. We'll get to gold in a bit. You're nodding as I'm saying this. Before I do, in the intro,
I talked about these trend changes. And I think we have talked about the trend change that the
hiking regime is probably done at this point in time. You're nodding. I'd say for sure.
Okay. We've talked that bonds may be reversing here, and you're saying, hey, we could well get
a rally in the near term, longer term murky, given what goes on with the additional reckless spending
that's going on. Stocks, we touched earlier that you think that stocks probably don't have a great
future ahead of them next year, especially if you go into recession. But specifically,
the Magnificent Seven stocks have really been what's powered the market this year.
So the S&P Seven. If you look at the S&P 493, it hasn't gone anywhere this year.
Right. The Russell 2000, as of this morning, was down.
Okay. So here's something that you said. You said Magnificent Seven techs attract all the
money in a wild FOMO driven frenzy, taking valuations to beyond nosebleed levels,
will eventually flame out as fundamentals do not support. So building off of that,
some other things that you've noted recently. You retweeted a Bloomberg headline that said Apple
delays work on next year's iPhone, max software to fix bugs. Here's what you said to that.
Nothing seems to matter when the boys be wilding. Four straight cuts of negative sales growth,
four straight quarters, sorry, of negative sales growth, guide downs, extreme overvaluations for
this ultimately will end badly. Meta's CFO also talked about seeing weakness in their advertising
revenues, which is basically how Meta makes its money. So when you look at-
And Google did too, by the way. Google did too.
Okay. Google did too, which makes sense. They live in the same ecosystem, advertising ecosystem.
So we've had these kind of bulletproof companies where you're shining a light and saying,
actually, they've got a lot of tarnish on them in a lot of ways. Apple, not only has it had,
oh yeah, four straight quarters of negative sales growth. We're not talking earnings
growth here. We're talking negative sales growth. That's top line revenues. And yet these companies
still enjoy these fantastic PEs and they still get the majority of the dollars that come into
the market through just the passive ETF indexing. Are they going to remain bulletproof or are these
warning signs that you're flashing a bright light on here finally going to start mattering next year?
They won't remain bulletproof. They weren't bulletproof last year. They got crushed.
You saw Meta drop 64% last year. Microsoft dropped 30%. Nvidia dropped 50%. It was down
68% at one point. Amazon was down 50%. So they weren't invincible then.
And then we had a rally in October, which the market was oversold and that was to be expected.
And when you get these rallies in bear markets, as we've seen before, I've seen it in 1990,
I saw it in 2000. I've seen it every time, 2007. When you're still on a bear market,
you haven't transitioned. Usually the old leaders are not your leaders and you have new leadership
and you get capitulation in what were the favorites. We've not seen the capitulation,
obviously. We saw a big decline. We then had that rally into October that was extended because of
the Fed's $700 billion increase. And also, there was one event that occurred around the same time
in March was the AI frenzy. And that got imaginations going quite a bit.
Right, that started the animal spirits.
Right. The animal spirits were going. And so they poured all into the AI plays,
which just so happened to be mostly the Magnificent Seven types. So that had a big
rally. But then we had another big decline. So we had a big a three month market decline
and these stocks all declined with it as well. Some less than others. But Apple took a pretty
hard hit down to $1.60. And, you know, when Google reported results just a couple of weeks ago that
had its biggest one day decline in that three month period. Since then, we've had a two week
just explosion of buying in these stocks. Once again, another one, another surge where they go
back into the favorites. Yet, you know, I put out my headline, the last newsletter I had was,
you know, Magnificent Three. I think I had a question mark because only the only ones whose
numbers were holding up were Microsoft, which had a good quarter still, Amazon, although it was all
most much of their much of their improvement was was due to the largest layoffs in history,
27000 people. And they just announced some more layoffs today in a business segment.
And then also Nvidia, which hasn't reported, but will in another week and a half. And they'll have
fantastic numbers, which we can get into if you'd like. But all the other four were trouble. I mean,
Tesla's earnings fell by 44 percent. And Elon Musk gave some very negative commentary going forward
into 2024. And we know in their case, in EVs, that there's been a big buildup in inventories and
his sales of his deliveries have not come through for several quarters now.
So Tesla was in trouble. Pretty big sticker price declines, too, on the retail. Well,
because they had to. They've had to in order to drive the sales that they have done. And so a huge
slowdown. And remember, Tesla is the most favorite stock amongst investors. It's the highest traded
stock and the highest traded options of any of them, any any stock out there, even though it's
not as large in market cap, it is not a trillion dollar market cap or more like some of the others.
It's the most popular stock and it has it has severe problems. And it's it's so of the magnitude
seven, that's the weakest one. And then and then you look at Apple. Well, you said, you know,
for consecutive quarters, it's likely going to happen again in the current quarter.
Foxconn just reported their October numbers and they were down. That's the largest manufacturing
partner. And they were down five percent year over year in October. You know, in Apple's case,
they have a new product line with iPhone, iPhone 15, and they're highlighting the titanium aspect
of the phone. Well, you've run out of colors now and now you start talking about a titanium
sheet over an aluminum base. And that's what you're highlighting, because there really isn't
much else a little bit faster, a little bit better camera. And it's really a marketing scheme than
anything else. You're highlighting titanium. Well, that's not going over so well right now.
You mean that's not a reason to drop twelve hundred bucks on a new phone?
No, in fact, no. And the Wall Street Journal's tech reporter headlined a story saying you don't
need a new iPhone. All you need is a new battery. Well, that doesn't help sales. And so so that but
that's that's a fact. So if the consumer is under pressure and they have this one point one trillion
dollars of debt and it's at twenty one percent, you really want to go out and buy another new
iPhone when there's nothing really there. And that's a problem. And then in addition to that,
they have serious problems in China. So their revenues in China were running at twenty percent.
And it was twenty four percent the quarter prior to that. It dropped to sixteen in the latest
quarter. And that's because the Chinese government told their government agencies and their
privately owned to not to buy iPhones anymore, as well as other Apple products. And one of the
reasons that is, is that Apple's trying to move away from China. And so there's a backlash there.
And also we had put restraints on on Huawei and almost killed them in the completely killed them
in the in the smartphone area. They were the number. At one point they were larger than Apple.
It was Samsung one, Huawei two and Apple three. Huawei just got decimated when we stopped when our
the suppliers couldn't issue them any components. Well, Huawei's kind of got around that over the
last couple of years and they came out with a Mate 60 phone, which was a big hit. And so that's
hurting and that will continue to hurt Apple sales going forward. So you have a big problem in China.
And then to make it worse, they went after Foxconn, the major manufacturer I talked about,
with tax audits and many subsidiaries and also looking at land, land use. So China's turned
against Apple and yet it was one of their largest markets. And that's only going to continue and get
worse. The Huawei Mate 60 phone was only introduced in September, only had one month of sales and it's
been a huge hit. And then Qualcomm came out with their numbers at the beginning of this month,
just a couple of weeks ago, and said that they were seeing a huge surge in Chinese in component
ordering. Qualcomm's the largest semiconductor maker for smartphones. And it was that they were
up 35%, indicating that Apple was going to be, essentially Apple's going to lose share because
the smartphone market itself is still declining. It declined 1% year over year in the third quarter.
And that was against a quarter before, it was a double digit decline. So these things aren't good
there. One other point is, is that Asia got a review, broke down the new iPhone and they found
that the components cost 10% more. So inflation impacting up in the past, that hasn't been a
problem because Apple's been able to raise prices. But now that they're competing with more like
Huawei, they couldn't raise prices this time, except on one model. So they're going to likely
take a hit here as they go forward from higher component costs. That's your number one market cap
company. So more competition from competitors, higher input component costs, which brings down
their profit margin, plus weaker consumer demand. That is not a good mix. No. And then one of the
things that they've been bolstering the bottom line. So they're still showing growth on the
bottom line, even though they don't have any growth on the top line. One of the ways they've
been doing that is through share buybacks, but they're not generating the cash that they used to.
And there's so many shares outstanding. Well, the market cap is so big that when you do $77 billion,
it's only 2%, so it doesn't move the needle any longer. And in fact, that buyback came down.
People talk about Apple, well, they have $162 billion of cash on the balancing. Well, yes,
they do. But they also have $110 billion in debt that they poured on in order to buy back all these
shares. So there's a net of only $50 billion. And that's fallen a lot. And this is the first time
I've seen this, that their buybacks were significantly less, 16% less in dollar terms
versus last year. Last year, they did $90 billion in buybacks. This year was only $76 or $77 billion.
So the buybacks itself are smaller on a $3 trillion market cap. So you don't have that
lever either anymore. Wow. I'm going to ask you a heretical question here, which is,
is Apple a short? It's my favorite short. That and Tesla. I think those are the two most at risk.
Now, when I say, is it a short? Well, for me, I don't short outright. It's very difficult to short
in a money printing environment because the Fed could come back in again and we could see higher
valuations nominally in the market. That's what happens in money printing periods.
So I only do it via put options. That's it. I limit my risk with put options, but it is my
biggest put option position. Great. And I'm guessing you're doing longer dated put options?
Yeah, I'm out to mid 2024. So I want some time. I want some time for the economy to continue
to decline. I want some more time for the Fed to pull more money out of the system. It's like
Jenga, you're pulling blocks out. And then when you'll get to the capitulation phase, and it might
be in the middle of next year, and that might be a very good time. Okay. I want to remind folks what
I said in the introduction, which is that you are the publisher of the high tech strategist and have
been doing that since 1987. So your analysis of the tech space isn't just some guy in the
internet's opinion. You are one of the top analysts following this sector for the past
40 years? I've been doing it for 40 years, since 1979. So I've been invested in the group since
1979. So that's 45 years to be exact, almost 45 years. Yeah. So my point is, folks listening,
you should place a lot of weight on what... That's where I spend most of my time in that
area. And I didn't get into... We talked about smartphones, but also PCs. And people think that
we hit a bottom there. Intel made some positive comments. Taiwan Semiconductor made some
similar kinds of comments, but I just had three... The three largest distributors of computer products
report results in the last two weeks. One of them is CDW, it's a $22 billion distributor
of computer products, so networking, hardware, PCs, all of that. 250,000 customers, and these
are corporate and small business customers. And this gets back to the erosion in the economy part
of it, but also ties into tech. What they saw was a worsening of demand. Not an improvement,
not a stabilization, it was a worsening. So they had in the prior conference call, which was for
the Q2 numbers, they had said they had seen some glimmers of hope, some early signs, and those
reversed on them. It got worse everywhere. It got worse in their international sales, it got worse
in domestic sales, worse small business, worse corporations, commerce everywhere except for
public government. And in cloud, which is still growing, 20% for them, and also security. But all
of the hardware categories were down double digit percent, including PCs, which are 15%. And Insight
and PC Connections said exactly the same thing. So people thought they were going to see an
improvement, thought they had seen stabilization, and in fact, reversed. That makes sense if the
economy is still turning down. Got it. So you're basically saying from your perch in the tech world,
and tech tends to be a leading industry, you are seeing the lag effect in action here.
You are actually seeing the gravitational force begin to pull down business results.
Right. Before it was just consumer, because we had had a big surge of consumer spending around COVID,
and then those people didn't need to upgrade their systems, didn't need to upgrade their PCs,
and so we saw a big consumer decline. What we're seeing now is worsening around the world of
business customers, and that's a much bigger market than consumer. And that's what you would
expect to see when these companies are under pressure, when their interest expenses are higher,
and many of the zombie-type companies are going to go out of business.
Okay. All right. Two last macro questions that I want to get into. Okay, so how does the average
viewer who's watching all this and maybe a little bit freaked out now about your somewhat dark
outlook, what should they consider doing about it? Inflation. I think we sort of danced around
this a little bit, but what are you expecting for inflation? So CPI is coming down. I talked about
that chart, which I haven't found yet, but I'll try to find while you're answering. It shows
how CPI tends to follow M2. And M2 is falling.
And M2 is falling. But it's an important, but maybe an overly simplistic way to look at it.
I'm curious, do you see the inflation fight as all over but for the crying, or do you think it's
going to be stickier than maybe today's data suggests? We're seeing very small amounts of
money supply declines right now, but we had seen a 50% decline over a three-year period, 40% over
two years during COVID. It was an enormous amount of money that was put into the system.
And that really, you know, part of inflation is inflation expectations. And so what I had said
about the University of Michigan consumer inflation expectations rising in the latest
report, that's not a good thing. But if you look, you know, oftentimes it gets, once you let
inflation get out of the bag, it starts to get going and you get inflation expectations rise,
people start demanding higher wages. So what are we seeing? Well, we just, we 25 to 30% increase
from auto workers right now. That's the deal. And those are unions, but just in the last few weeks
now, Hyundai had to come out with a, that was this week, 25% increase in their wages over next several
years, five years, I think. Honda increased theirs by 11%, Toyota by 9%. Those were immediate
increases. And you had UPS had big wage hikes. My brother-in-law works for FedEx and he's telling
me we're way underpaid. We'll be next. We'll get our big increase. After seeing what happened with
UPS. Absolutely. You can imagine this first thing they did was go to the manager's office.
Yeah. So, you know, we've seen it in healthcare. We've seen it in service workers in Las Vegas.
There's more union activity than we've ever seen in years and years and years. And they're all
getting, they're all getting higher wages. And that's why that Atlanta Fed wage tracker at 5.2%
is meaningful. In addition to that, healthcare costs continue to rise. The Mercer group,
which monitors these things, they're predicting 6.5% increase in health and insurance,
health insurance costs, I should say, in 2024. And then PWC just came out with a forecast for
2024 of 7% increase in medical costs versus 6% last year and five and a half the year before.
So you can see these are major components of inflation. Wages, health insurance, health,
healthcare costs, and they're all rising. And people's expectations for inflation are there too.
And that's why I think it'll be very difficult to get the inflation numbers. I knew the inflation
numbers would come down. I knew that would happen. There were shortages, supply chain problems,
base effects where it would show, where it would decline as a result of that. Energy prices would
come down off the top, which they did, but those are all done. And now you have these more
persistent declines because inflation expectations have been released. So I don't think it's going to
be easy to get to the 2% target rate that they have. Okay. And folks, I'm just putting up that
chart of CPI versus M2 that I mentioned earlier, just so you can see the trajectory that we were
talking about. Now, of course, Fred has just thrown a lot of sand in the gears of this simplistic
argument to say, "Hey, there's a lot of things that could support inflation going up from here."
Fred, let me just ask you to square part of that circle with me, which is take that,
which everything you said is absolutely happening right now. Don't disagree at all.
But if I share your prediction that we're going to have a recession next year and maybe a pretty
serious one, a lot of that stuff can get unwound in many ways by a serious recession. Demand brings
down a lot of good prices, brings down a lot of service prices. Yeah, maybe you can't renegotiate
those wage contracts quickly, but you sure can lay people off. So you can be paying your average
worker more on average, but you just have less average workers. I just think it would be hard to
get to what I'm saying is it'll be because of these other pressures and potentially also the
dollar decline, which I think is almost certain on a purchase power parity basis, dollars way too
high. So that would be inflationary as well. Those pressures will make it difficult for the rate to
come down as fast as some people think it will. I wouldn't be surprised to see it come down. I would
expect it to come down unless something happens. I would expect it to come down, but not to get it
down to 2%. That's what's going to be difficult. So in a recession, now if it gets to be the really
severe part of a recession, the Fed will come back in and they'll print again and then you might get
that wave effect that we saw in the 70s where you kept going, you went down for a while and then you
went back up again and down for a while and then went back up again. And as long as they still
think this quantitative easing tool works, that's probably what you're going to get.
Right. So that's the Arthur Burns effect that Powell is frightened of here. Just to give you
some further ammunition, Fred, that's the path that Felix Zulauf sees us being stuck in for the
next decade. He calls it the decade of the roller coasters. We keep doing this. Now, I'm not trying
to pick a fight here, but one of the reasons why I was sort of digging around for your inflation
prediction is the video, one of the videos that precedes you on this channel recently is David
Rosenberg saying that he expects CPI to be at a 1% handle by the end of next year. Sounds like you
think that that's going to be pretty tough unless we just had some horrific recession.
Yeah, David's a good friend of mine. He thought inflation was going -- no disrespect to him
because I think he's one of the very best economists there are out there -- he thought
inflation was going to come down a lot faster. He believed it was transitory and it wasn't.
And he's always been a little bit too optimistic on how far inflation is going to come. And I was
not in agreement with back then and I'm not in agreement with him. And that's probably the only
thing I'm not in agreement with him on is his inflation forecast. That's fine. And look, as I
always say on this channel, smart people can look at the same data and come to different
conclusions and that's what makes a market, right? Okay, so sounds like one of your most high
conviction predictions from where we are right here is what you just said, which is that the
dollar is way too high, especially on a purchase price parity basis. Can you first, just very
quickly for folks that don't understand PPP, what it is and why you think the dollar is so
overvalued right now? Well, I look at the charts and they show it's like 30 percent over. So,
basically it tries to measure what your purchasing power is for the dollar versus the yen or the euro
and what it really should be. And it shows that the dollar, relative to the goods you can buy
elsewhere, is overvalued. That's essentially it. There's a big MAC index where they actually
measure MAC hamburger prices. That's another way of doing it. It seems to have worked well over time.
Sorry, that's not an acronym. You're saying it's the big MAC index, which is what you can buy
a big MAC and McDonald's for in different currencies. In different currencies, that's right.
Yeah, and so that's the big MAC index also shows the same thing where the dollars are
overvalued by about 30 percent. And it's only happened, it's only been at this level a couple
of times before in the last decades and each time the dollar's falling rapidly. So, a reversion to
the mean. What you would expect is that to happen. You know, right now there's, you know, the US has
24 percent of the world's GDP, I think two or three or four percent of the world's population
and 60 percent of the money invested in stocks. Well, a lot of that's foreign money and that
money is in dollars. And if they start selling, as I expect they will, you're going to see,
just as they're reselling bonds right now, the Japanese are, you're going to see weakness in
the dollar. Okay, and so again, I believe that that's one of your higher conviction positions
right now. So, now moving into, okay, so how can people sort of position themselves for the
type of future you see coming? Obviously, they'd want to be positioning themselves for a future
where there's a weaker dollar. I believe that's one of the main tenets for why you're bullish on
gold right now. True? Absolutely. You know, what you ought to do, though, too, you should put up
that first chart you had of the Fed pauses. We should do that because that's important to the
gold story. All right. You talk and I'll bring it up. Okay. So, you showed, that chart shows three
pauses there. One was around 2000 time frame, one was 2006 time frame, one was 2019 time frame.
Gold does really, so, okay, there's one in 1980s there as well, but see the 2000, 2006, and again
in 2019, you see the three pauses there. Well, gold went up 170% right after that, 200 after 2000,
and it went further, a lot further, obviously, up by 600%. And then 2006, it went up 270% on that
pause, after that pause, and in 2019, it went up 150% after that pause. So, we just paused and we
just got a big rally in gold here. I don't think that's a coincidence. So, that's one of the main
reasons that you want to be long gold. In addition to that, you know, and we do have a sticky
inflation, that is a positive as well. And then one of the big factors that I think is driving gold
to ever higher lows and eventually to higher highs, I guess, is this enormous demand that's
coming from overseas buyers. So, you know, last year we had central banks buy 1,100 something tons
of gold. This year to date, they have purchased 800 tons, they're up, I think it's around 15%
over last year. So, they're running at a record pace again. Central banks used to account for 10
to 12% or so of world gold demand. It's now 25% plus. So, central banks, and it's not just
the central banks, and it's not just the enemies of the U.S. who are behind the sea there,
who are dumping bonds like China, but countries like Poland, which has purchased this year to date
111 tons. Now, they've increased that by their positioning by 50%. Now, Poland's a friend of the
U.S. Some of these countries are buying because they're worried about the weaponization of the
dollar. So, enemies of the U.S., all of those brick countries, almost all of them are buying
gold. But in addition to that, Poland's there, Singapore has purchased 80 tons this year.
You have Czechoslovakia's increased theirs by 125%. These are all friendly countries to the U.S.
So, all around the world, they're buying gold. And part of the reason is that they see, you know,
we just had all these downgrades of the debt, and they see the problems here. They see the lack of
fiscal discipline, and they see the deficits going crazy, and they want to protect themselves as well.
So, all that demand has been growing and growing and growing. And, you know,
and so it may be higher because China doesn't report everything. The Bank of China doesn't
report. Sometimes they don't report all, but lately they've just been reporting less than
they're actually buying based upon what I know and we know. But also Saudi Arabia is not reporting,
yet we know they're buying too. So, all these central banks are buying gold, and it's lifting
the lows, higher lows, on gold. So, in 2015, where we bottomed at $10.50 gold, we've not,
we then went up into 2018, the $11.80 low. Last year's low was $16.10. This year's low is $18.20.
This is all being done without any real Western demand. In fact, it's negative demand. The GLD
ETF, which is the largest ETF, currently has only 800 tons in its holdings. That's down from,
it's down 410 tons from where it was just three years ago. And the IAU, which is the second
largest gold ETF, is down close to 30% in their holdings. These are Western-based, so mostly U.S.
and Europe, and they've been dumping gold. Let me just ask this question because I have trouble
understanding it, which is why? We just had massive inflation for the first time in decades.
You would think people would be rushing out to buy gold. Because everybody's chasing the
magnificent seven and that's what happened. Gold does well in times of turmoil. Gold does well
when the stock market is not doing well. In the 1970s, the stock market was a poor place to be.
But it was a giant gold market. In 1980 to 2000, people were chasing the tech stocks,
especially in the end in the late 1990s, and gold was abandoned. Same thing. And gold was a 20-year
bear market. Then we had a big decline, a couple of big bear markets in 2000 to 2002 and then again
in 2008. And gold had a massive run. Gold went up, as I said, 600% and the miners went up 1600%
during that time. And then we went back into the magnificent seven here in these recent years.
And so Western investors have been abandoning it. They don't see a need. They think they're
in the Goldilocks environment, where inflation is okay and the economy is going to keep growing.
And they have belief in the central bank. They have belief that the Fed is in control. And
I don't. I don't know why anyone does, but they do. And they want to believe. They want to,
and that's why they keep going back, keep buying the magnificent seven. They want to believe
everything's going to be okay, just as they tried to do the same in 2000 with tech stocks.
So when they're buying magnificent seven, then no interest in gold in the West. But if you think the
magnificent seven companies like Tesla can't sustain its market cap or Apple can't sustain
a $3 trillion market cap, then if those start falling, there'll be much more interest in gold
from the West. And so we've not seen, all we've seen is outflows, outflows, outflows, outflows,
and the futures positions are also low. So the managed money hedge fund positions in gold are
also very low as well. That demand on top of the demand that's been lifting us to higher lows,
from overseas, could set you off on a real big run in gold.
Okay, great. So just because we're at the hour here and I want to be respectful of your time,
I'm going to get to sort of the rapid fire segment to kind of wrap things up here.
So you just made a great case for gold. Is 2024 the year that the Western markets get the memo
on gold? I think so because I think the magnificent seven is going to have a rough year.
The economy is going to be weak. The buying overseas will continue. There's no reason that
won't. The dollar will decline. That's also positive for gold. The eight-year cycle that
my friend Felix Zulauf talks about, we just began that. These next three years are supposed to be
great. From a technician standpoint, the 10-year over a decade cup and handle is perfect. And so
for almost any way, any aspect you want to look at it, yes, it's going to go and probably go for
a few years. Okay, and how are you -- because I know you do talk about your gold views in your
newsletter, which I love that the guy writing the high-tech newsletter is into something as low tech
as gold -- how are you recommending that people consider playing it? Is it more just owning the
metal itself? Is it playing the miners which give you leverage to the price? Well, I think that
given the situation that we're in and what the outlook is for gold and silver will follow,
it's good to own physical metals. And so I own a certain percentage, you know, personally.
And some people say it could be five or ten percent or, you know, could be more. You know,
that's prudent. And it's insurance against all of the things that I just talked about if they occur.
Obviously, much more speculatively, the miners, which will -- I talked about the
22,000 time frame where gold went up 600%, but miners went up 16 times, 1,700%.
It also can go down. We've seen miners go down 75% to 90%. They have these kinds of huge swings.
And there's a lot of mining investors over the past decade that have experienced that part of
the ride. Well, you know, that's the problem is they came in -- they didn't come in in 2002 into
the miners like I did, right? My first miner positions. They came in in 2008. They came in in
2011. You know, always at the top, which is the mistake you have to buy when they're hated, which
is what they are now. You know, the Huey de Gold ratio is 0.108. It was 0.12 when we were speaking.
It's gotten worse and it's almost at a record low right now. When we spoke some months ago,
it was 0.12. The 20-year average is 0.2. And back in the bull market days, they averaged, you know,
0.46. So severely undervalued to net asset value. They're hated. There's no interest. There's no
volume. If you're a contrarian, it's the time to buy. But you have to be wary that, you know,
they're a volatile group. On the upside, they generally do two to three times better than the
price of gold. But they also decline that as much. I think it's a good time to do it. But it all
depends upon one's personal position, you know, what their responsibilities and all that are.
Absolutely. And as you know, Fred, on this channel, every video I tell people to, you know,
almost everybody watching this, unless they're super experienced, started doing this themselves,
especially in this sector, should be working under the guidance of a professional financial advisor.
So you're not giving individual advice and everybody needs to talk to your professional
to find out what works best for them. Correct. Correct.
OK. So we've got your-- it sounds like you're very optimistic on gold and gold related equities.
Sounds like you are pretty bearish on the big tech, the Magnificent Seven. You've talked about,
you know, Tesla and Apple are the ones that you're most bearish on out of that crew.
Bonds, it sounds like you're guardedly optimistic in the near term. But there's a lot of risk out
there and it's not time in your estimation to go whole hog on the long treasury trade.
I like the short treasuries. I have big positions in the shorts because I'm getting paid
up to five and a half percent. And I just want to be super clear for folks.
You're saying you like short duration treasuries. You're not saying short treasuries. You're saying
short duration. No, no, no. Short term duration treasuries, you know, out to two years or
something. I don't want to take a duration risk there. Yeah. I mean, best-- I don't want to say
best ever, but certainly best in decades for investors that want to get a positive real return.
With no risk. You don't have to take a lot of risk there. That's the thing, you know, it's
really something to take advantage of, I think, right now. Yeah. Any other potential, you know,
investment areas that have your attention? I talked about the, you know, how everyone's
piled in around the world. It's piled in the U.S. stocks with 60% of all the market valuation. So
that means that the rest of the world has been abandoned and has. So I'm not an expert in
international and international. I own a couple of different names, but I'm not an expert in that
area. But I know Japanese stocks are cheap and their earnings are improving and they've done a
lot of a lot of positive things. Corporations are starting to wake up, I think, over there.
And so Murphy and Martin are cheap as well. Warren Buffett agrees with you, by the way.
Yeah, that doesn't hurt. So, you know, look, if you have the ability to look outside,
if you have an advisor that has expertise in that area, that's an area that should be looked at,
I think, though it's not my area of expertise. All right, great. Well, look, I'll wrap it up
here given that you've very generously gone over the hour. Fred, for folks that have really enjoyed
