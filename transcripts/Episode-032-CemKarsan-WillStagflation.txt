Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder
and your host, Adam Tegard. Well, it's a new year and with it, I'm doing my best to bring important
new voices into the discussion here at Thoughtful Money. And today we're fortunate to sit down with
one of them, Jem Carson, founder, CIO and managing principal of CHI volatility advisors, widely known
as Jem Croissant on X, formerly known as Twitter. He's one of the more requested names I've had from
this audience and I'm thrilled we've been finally able to make an interview with him happen. Jem,
thanks so much for joining us today. Thanks for having me. Great to be here.
Oh, it's a total pleasure. Like I said, you're one of the most requested names by this viewing
audience. Thank you so much for clearing your calendar early in 2024 to make this discussion
happen. I'm excited for many reasons to talk with you today, Jem, but a really big one is sort of
your relatively unique and proprietary framework with how you guys sort of see the world and see
what's driving markets. And if we can, I'd like to just start at the high level of how you see
the world. I'm going to ask you my normal kickoff question, which is intentionally broad, but then
we're going to kind of get into how you see the markets before we turn on the camera. You sort
of talked about, they've been famously referred to in the past as a voting machine in the short run
and a weighing machine in the long run. Let's talk about both the voting machine and the weighing
machine, but to get the conversation kicked off here, what's your current assessment of
the global economy and financial markets? The current market environment is really,
you have to bring in both that voting and weighing machine to really talk about that.
We're amidst a big, in my opinion, regime change, a big structural change that's happening. So,
a broader cycle change, but something very different than the last 40 years.
But in the context of that, we are cyclically kind of moving through a usual kind of
ebb and flow. So, from a structural perspective, we see populism having taken hold in a major way
in the last decade, really. And really, with the election of Joe Biden after Donald Trump,
a real move towards this populism, which had been building to a real actionable,
both fiscal spending, as well as de-globalization and protectionism. All of that has led to a
different structural environment, while at the same time now, cyclically, we are trying to
push against that and use the old tools that we've really used in the last 40 years to try
and manage that. So, at this current moment, and we'll dive back into all of that, at this
current moment, we really do see a push and pull happening between these structural inflationary
pressures that we've seen, again, in the past, in the '60s and '70s, in the '40s and '50s,
and another way before, but really trying to now battle that with, again, cyclical kind of really
strong measures of raising interest rates 5% in a year or so, etc. So, it is a volatile time
in the sense that it creates a very kind of seemingly balanced market at times,
but what we refer to it as a sumo market where there's lots of pressure. If you have two
entities, two pressures coming together in a meaningful way that can compress volatility
at a moment, but that doesn't mean the situation is stable. It doesn't take much of a slip of a
toe to create that force to be kind of unleashed. And we really do believe we're in this very
precarious kind of structural environment where secularly, there's a lot of global shifts
happening that are being managed with contrary forces. So, I think that we'll start there,
but there's a lot to dive into underneath the hood. What is causing those secular structural
forces? How is it being managed? What are the new things in the market and market microstructure
that are changing? So, there's a lot to dive into. So, let's dive into all of it. Just to clarify a
couple of things here from the start. If I heard you correctly, we're experiencing a regime change
where structurally we're entering an era different from the one that we've been accustomed to for the
past 40-ish years or so. And if I heard you right, our central planners are basically using a cyclical
playbook to address these new structural changes, which I think one could interpret as saying
they're using the wrong playbook for the needs at hand. You're nodding as I'm saying this. So,
do I have that part right? That's absolutely correct. Okay. And then just to understand
volatility, because I sense we're going to talk more about this later, you say it's a
volatile time. And I think by that, you probably mean there's just lots of disruption and change
to the status quo that we've all gotten accustomed to over the past bunch of decades.
But volatility specifically is something that your firm focuses on closely. And if you've been
looking at volatility as measured by the VIX over the past year or so, it's been historically very
low on a relative basis. And what you're saying is, don't be deceived by that, because there are
these macro pressures, you call them sort of sumo market forces, pressing against each other. And
maybe in the short term, almost like a tectonic plate, they're in stasis. But when they shift,
they can shift quite dramatically and violently. And so don't get lulled to sleep by these low
volatility ratings that traditional measures like the VIX have been showing us. You're kind of
nodding as I'm saying this, but do I have that right? Very well summarized. Absolutely. I couldn't
agree more. Okay, great. All right. So, I just want to make sure I and the viewers here sort
of understand where you're coming from. All right. So, how do you want to jump off from here? What
should we expect going forward? Maybe we can start with inflation just because you mentioned it. Do
you see indeed a secular higher inflation regime ahead of us? Yeah, I agree. Let's start there. And
this one, you really have to kind of go back to the very beginning. And when I say the beginning,
I really mean the beginning. If you think about it, there's two major forces that matter
really in humankind broadly. One is natural selection, right? This idea of competition
and survival of fittest, that is a winner take all system. Capitalism essentially is a way of
expressing that and feeding into that system. But we are human beings. And one of our reasons,
the way we're differentiated from other animals is we have a bigger frontal cortex.
What that means is that we are able as human beings to better define ourselves and ourselves
relative to the world around us. That sense of self is a very specific human
quality. And we are particularly think of ourselves as individuals. That causes this idea
of fairness, of justice, of equality, of equity. All of these words are not actually not natural
constructs. From day one, your mother probably told you life is not fair, right? Life is not fair
at its core. However, as human beings, we believe fairness is important. And as a people, we believe
that's important. And these two forces are often opposing to one another. I know I told you I was
going to go way back here. You did. You're basically talking about sort of a winner
take all versus we're all in this together and should treat each other fairly.
Correct. And these are essentially left and right if you really think about them, right?
This is not a new construct, but these two things are very important to understand.
One of them is the natural kind of state of things. And another one is something we're
trying to exert and control within the other. Because of that, the natural system tends to
go to a winner take all and money tends to accrue to the top and power tends to accrue to the top.
And every once in a while it goes too far and we get kind of a revolution or rebalancing,
right? Depending on things. This is a tale as old as time, right? This is not a new idea,
but important to kind of remember that. And where do we sit in the context of that,
right? This is why big cycles happen, really big regime change cycles.
The US was founded on this idea of more equality and justice, right? But allowing
the free market system within that to kind of operate and just to kind of rebalance as we go.
What the founding fathers were really scared about in the United States is that the power
would ultimately be wrested from the people naturally because then the natural system,
that's what happened. They were very careful to allow no such systems that didn't have checks and
balances on them to take that power away. Unfortunately, people don't like volatility.
We decided over time to try and smooth the business cycle. And in order to smooth the
business cycle, we created something called the Federal Reserve. Our founding fathers would be
turning in their grave if they knew we were creating a structure that powerful that was
unchecked and it is largely unchecked. Because of that, especially once Nixon took us off of the
gold standard, the Federal Reserve now began to have immense control, right? And they were no
longer constrained by the value of gold. Fiat allows for dramatic power, especially when you
have the exorbitant privilege of the US dollar like the US has at this point. And so the Federal
Reserve now has controlled the whole economy for some time. And what was realized about in 1996
with Greenspan is that there was really an unlimited ability to continue to stimulate
with monetary policy as long as we had the exorbitant privilege here in the US without
causing inflation. And the natural "state of unemployment" was lowered and lowered and lowered
again. Why is that? Why is that? Because natural selection and capitalism, putting more oxygen in
the system ultimately does lead to more growth, but it does it by sending money to the top.
You send money to capital. Who borrows money when interest rates go to zero? Mostly corporations,
mostly wealthy individuals. They're the ones that can borrow money and borrow money at scale.
Also, obviously, QE, the new thing that we've created in the last 20 some years,
is also directly to capital. And who owns capital? Who owns companies? These are the top,
not just 1%, but top 0.1%. And so we have been using one tool, the Federal Reserve has been using
one tool, which is monetary policy, supply side economics, sending money to the top,
to balance two things, both employment and price stability. But they've been doing that in a sense,
trying to manage the whole economy. And that is not the whole economy. It would be the whole
economy if we did not have humans in the system. It is the way of natural selection. It is sending,
in Socrates' words, the best violins to the best violin players. But what that does ultimately is
that creates a very, very unequal system and it creates inequality. And what we've seen since we've
got taken off the gold standard and really starting in the 1980s with all the supply side economics,
is an incredible expansion of wealth disparity, driven primarily by the Federal Reserve.
Gini coefficients, which are a measure of the width of the distribution of wealth here in the
US have gone from 0.34 to 0.47. We are in line with third world countries, that idea of the US
middle class being an engine of growth here is no longer the case, but we have moved far beyond that.
And I'm not arguing to be clear for one system or another that being better, but this is a function
of balance and two forces as we mentioned. And we went to an extreme level of inequality because
every time the market declined, we responded with the same tool, which was sending money to the top.
That created a structurally deflationary period. It's important to understand. Why is printing
money, which we would think would be inflationary, deflationary? Well, if you print money and send
it to the corporations, what do corporations do with it? Corporations are profit seeking entities.
A profit seeking entity has one goal, which is to make profit. That means reduce their costs
and increase their sales. Well, what's happened in the same 40 years, it's not a coincidence that
we've had a massive growth of a globalization in the world. Corporations are transnational.
We have expanded incentive, the supply chains have been expanded to China and the growth of
China has been a big function of 0% interest rates as well. On top of that, deflation is a three-legged
tool, globalization has happened, but also technological development. If you send a bunch
of money to capital and corporations battle it out at a very intense level and they have unlimited
funds, you create Amazon and you create Uber and you create all kinds of other things that
ultimately take labor and substitute labor with technology as well. That and just the simple lower
cost of capital makes it much more profitable at business. It's not a surprise that we're at record
profit margins. This in the grand history of things is an outlier, the profit margins of
corporations is a function of historical monetary policy. So very long-winded, but I have to start
at the beginning and kind of get you to where we are. So at some point, inequality becomes
a problem because people believe in an idea of fairness and justice and equality and equity.
There are those words. Do those words sound familiar in this generation? Absolutely.
We heard these in another generation, maybe in the 1960s. Yes. And that's not a coincidence.
When you start to move towards populism and this idea that we need equity and equality and justice
and fairness, what happens? The money no longer goes to the top. Now we're redistributing wealth
from the top and we're sending money to the bottom. This populism started really 12 years
ago or so. You heard Piketty wrote a book about equality. Everybody was talking about equality.
You had Occupy Wall Street, you had the Tea Party, but it didn't come to political fruition yet
because it needed time. Why did it need time? Why do these things operate on a general timescale?
Why don't they happen sometimes over 100 years and sometimes over 20 years? Well,
they happen more regularly because labor or the bottom of the distribution tends to be youth.
And the top of the distribution in capital tends to be an older generation. You can take
wealth disparity and you can really turn it on the horizontal axis and talk about it as
generational disparity. And that very much happened in the 60s as well. You've seen all
the videos. If you live through it and you're older, you know that there was this generational
divide during that time. We're seeing that again now. You hear the term boomer thrown around every
day. And it's real. Why does this younger generation feel this way? Why is there this
disparity? Because they have underperformed. They're at 40% the wealth creation and household
formation that baby boomers were at this time in their cycle. They're living at home, a lot of them
in mom and dad's basement and can't afford a home. That anger, that feeling of inequality is driving
a populist drive. And every four years, every election cycle, that millennial generation on
down goes to greater and greater political dominance as baby boomers start to die off.
And here we are moving through this cycle, this populist cycle. And the response is $9 trillion
of fiscal spending, which is what we did, which is an order of magnitude more than any other time in
history adjusted for inflation. It is the size of the new deal. 10 times, sorry, the size of the new
deal. Now, adjusted for GDP, about the same size, but it is a massive amount of fiscal spending.
And a lot of that's still in the pipe. We don't even have to pass more at this point. It's coming,
it's here. It's being spent. We are also seeing protectionism, which is the cousin of populism.
The more you're populist, you care about your people, not the people of the world, your people.
And that creates a system that is no longer cooperative, but that is competitive. Is it
a coincidence that in the 1960s and '70s that we saw the growth of a new cold war, that we saw the
beginnings and the growth of a hot war in Vietnam, which was a reflection of that competition,
is it a surprise that we saw an OPEC crisis where entities were flexing their muscles and trying to
use their resources for their benefit? Does that sound familiar to another time that you know?
So these things are not coincidences. These are all part of a much broader secular
regime change. And this is where we are in the cycle. These cycles don't end overnight because
they are political cycles and they are rebalancing. If we choose as a people to prioritize median
outcomes, as opposed to mean outcomes, which sound very similar, but are very different things,
we experience above trend inflation. And we are just at the beginning of this cycle.
And it is important to keep that in context as you look forward in the next 10, 15 years.
So that is the weighing machine. That is the bigger picture that we talk about.
Underneath that now are short-term cyclical reaction functions that affect this, as well as
structural supply and demand factors of a market that is not necessarily where it was in the 1960s
and 70s. We have derivatives, we have all kinds of other things that did not exist during that time.
And a lot of those forces really affect the path within a bigger structural regime change.
Wow. Now I understand why you have been so in demand for the viewing audience here,
Jem. This is great. So I just want to clarify one thing to make sure everybody gets it.
When you talked about the way that system has been run for
foreseeable memory, which was sending capital to those at the top, that that is a deflationary model
and you explained why. In a populism world where you are trying to address equity and money starts
getting sent to the bottom, that is inflationary. And of course, we saw that with the 9 trillion in
fiscal spending that was spent and then we saw CPI at 9%. So I just want to make sure that that is
part of why you see us in a secular inflation regime going forward is because we have flipped
from sending it directly to the elite to now much more of it is going to go towards the bottom.
Or I think the way you said it is actually really a great way to frame it, which is
we went from prioritizing mean outcomes to median outcomes. As everybody knows,
you can look at how the average person is doing and that is getting pulled way up by that 1%
or 0.1% at the top that makes the average look much better than it really is when you look at
I guess the median person where you are like, wow, they are still doing pretty poorly, right?
So a populist movement really does strive to raise the standard of the median person.
Which may not be GDP maximizing. Median prioritization is not the same as mean. Mean
prioritization is maximizing GDP. And so as a people, you may need to say, hey,
listen, maybe we don't want to grow at the fastest rate as a country, as an economy.
Maybe you want the average, the median person to do better. And if that's what we choose,
which is an idea of fairness and justice, again, not a natural system, that is less efficient and
that is not maximizing, but that might be better for us as a people. And that's a political
decision. I'm not making an argument for one or the other, but the truth is that over time,
these competing forces push and pull on one another over time.
Well, and this is the work, as I know you are aware of demographer Neil Howe, who has the
turnings model, right? And he says that right now we are in a fourth turning, which is really kind
of when the status quo, the old order falls apart and begins to get replaced by something new.
And one of the characteristics he says of a fourth turning is a demand for a lot more centralized
control. And actually there's a demand from the populace for this to happen. It's not just the
folks running the system wanting to reserve more control. The populace is saying, we want you guys
to solve these problems, get involved, right? And one of the things that Neil says is, yeah,
you get a lot of disruptive change, but a commonality of that change in these fourth turnings
is towards more equity. And so he said, look, it's for other people to determine whether that's
a good thing or a bad thing, but you certainly can make an argument that says, hey, if you have
a system that has become highly unequal, a return to equity for the majority of people might be in
that good. And to your point, it might not be GDP maximizing. There might be people who are at the
top who are doing less well going forward, but you may have an awful lot more opportunity for an
awful lot more people coming out of it. Again, I'm not trying to put a value judgment on this
necessarily. I'm just saying that is a characteristic that Neil Howe has said that
fourth turnings generally tend to exert. I want to go into more of the voting machine side of things,
just because you sort of gave a quick nod to the fact that there are a lot of things that are kind
of making it different this time because we didn't have things like the derivative exposure that we
have now. And I'm sure there's some other factors there. So I'd like to understand how the voting
machine is impacting the transition of the weighing machine. Real quickly, and I'll let
you decide whether we want to get into this now or punt this for later. A question I have found
myself asking in previous interviews like this when this topic has come up is, I asked the
guest, what do you think is more likely and what are you more worried about, a financial crisis
or a social crisis? And you're definitely shining a light on the fertile field here for social
unrest as we have a society that is becoming more and more unfair economically just because more
wealth and opportunity is concentrating at the top. You talked about the plight of younger
generations. I mean, empirically, they're being left behind on a relative basis to say where the
boomers were at their same age. I actually consult. So I have people that reach out to me who want my
advice on how to create their own YouTube channel or whatnot. And I'm consulting with a guy,
mentoring a guy who is creating a channel about servicing the needs of millennials. So this
channel is basically going to be focusing on the big trends that millennials wrestle with.
And right at the top of it is affordability. Housing is an extremely common issue that goes
on there. And also, I think just opportunity in the workforce. You talked about the huge
incentive that corporations have had, both with low capital and with improving technology
to basically replace human capital with automation. It just makes all the sense in the
world of them economically. But in the process, we are hollowing out the on-ramp for jobs, for
new talent to skill up and be able to demand a premium in the jobs market.
So there is a lot of understandable despair that's growing in these younger generations. And I've got
kids. And Jem, I know you've got kids from having looked at your Twitter feed. We hear it from them.
And it's understandable. So are we laying the seeds of a social -- I don't know if revolution
is too strong of a word here -- but some social movement that demands the pendulum swing
further towards the median person's benefit because of just the --
We have already laid the seeds, yeah. The problem here now is how do we get there
without that tumult? And the truth is it's very hard. This is, again, the natural system.
The reason people start to look to government to try and fix these things is nothing is big enough
or strong enough that can be controlled by the people other than government to help wrest this
away from capitalism. The natural state of things is for this to go further and further down this
path. And so it takes a level of political uprising and frustration, crisis, if you will,
to rejuvenate and to rebalance a system. This is why cycles happen.
It would be easier if we could really just keep these things in mind and as a government to really
kind of use capitalism, not let it get out of control. It doesn't work that way, unfortunately.
Because we're human, exactly. And because we live in a natural system.
But government has all kinds of problems. I think we can all agree with that. It's not
efficient in a lot of ways. But it is the only real way to kind of help right some of these
wrongs. Or if you don't think they're wrong and you don't believe in median outcomes,
it's the only... That's at least politically the only avenue really to rest that control.
Times where we go through these tend to be very tumultuous times. If you went and asked somebody
during the 1960s how it felt, people felt like the world was coming apart at the seams.
You look back now and you say, "Well, made some great changes. People was a little bit of a
hiccup." But it really was, I mean, multiple assassinations, Vietnam, people were going to
war. It was- The race protests.
Race protests. The gender divide.
You think it feels bad now. Everybody's like, "Oh my gosh, what's happening? It's because
we're coming out of this artificially kind of peaceful time." So it feels like the rate of
change feels really bad. But if you compare this to the '60s, this is nothing. I'll go one further
than that. Go back to the 1930s. You think this is bad? Go tell the greatest generation of the 1940s
that World War II was nothing compared to what we're about to go through.
This is the type of thing we're going through. It will be very difficult. It will be a crisis,
in a sense. We are entering this type of period now, and it will involve some forms of war and
conflict. Some of that will be economic. Some of that will be political. Some of that will be
actual war. And we're seeing that. You can't turn your head to what's happening in front of us.
Those are a function of these same forces. People really like to separate them and think of them as
idiosyncratic things. They're all tied into this reality. That said, if you look at what has
revitalized and re-pushed against the entropy of the things that we've created here in the U.S.,
and re-stabilized the U.S.'s role and the importance of freedom and justice and all
the things that at least I believe in here, they've all come out of those periods.
And without those crises, we would not have revitalized the system and allowed it to
pursue. So these cycles are important. If we didn't have them, if we went another 40 years
like this, I would fear massive structural problems. And again, healthy that they happen
and important that they happen. The key is to not let the system totally fall apart in the meantime.
And for the most part, we are all incentivized together to do that. And that tends towards a
reality where that is not likely to happen. Doesn't mean it can't, to be clear. But imagine
this as a time of revitalization, a burning of the underbrush, which is important for the long-term
health and survival of the system. All right. So what's interesting is you have the forces for
change that we've just been talking about, but also you have every player that benefits from the
current power structure, like doing everything they can to keep the status quo going on here.
And I'm just curious. I agree. We're talking about cycles. So we probably are going through
the cycle. It's just the natural order of things. I think you could make the argument,
at least economically, where you talked about how the creation of the Fed was to try to smooth out
the business cycle, is that we have maybe had a longer than standard period of no forest fires or
no burning of the underbrush. And so one might worry that this could be more prolonged and maybe
the actual conflagration could be bigger than normal because we've delayed things for so much.
You're kind of smiling and nodding a bit as I'm saying this. Do you feel like that's sort of the
danger here? Yes. You're 100% coming along. This is the reason I brought up the Federal Reserve.
Our system was built here in the United States to necessitated volatility and necessitated crisis.
You needed some level of unanimity to pass laws and to change things that needed to be changed.
By smoothing the business cycle and coming to the rescue with something that seemed like a
golden goose that just kept laying the golden egg, that we wouldn't have inflation,
but we could continue to solve the business cycle issue. By doing that, you remove crisis and that
meant there was no change. If you look, there have been no constitutional changes. There have been no
major law changes for quite some time until... And during these times, we start to see those changes
happen again because crisis allows for those changes to happen. Again, with that analogy,
if you don't clear the underbrush, things can get much worse for the system. You can start to see
real entropy within a system without the necessary change that needs to happen. This is a big driver
for why we have such political conflict on two sides. We haven't made changes and rebalanced
things for some time. Crisis actually brings people together. I know that sounds counter
intuitive, but crisis brings people together. You better believe people were pretty much on the same
side during World War II here in the United States. You better believe that as things started to change
in the 1970s and '80s, people started to come together. Crisis is ultimately something that
changes things for the better, at least as the full populace tends to think.
Is it fair to say that, one, you think our default assumption should be,
we're going through this cycle. We're going to have the pains of transition here. That should
be our default. We shouldn't be trying to pretend ourselves that it may not happen. We should plan
for it and be pleasantly surprised if it doesn't happen maybe. But secondly, if we follow the
script of the cycle, we will pull together around a crisis. So it sounds like you are predicting
that at some point, something is going to break in a way that the current power structure can't
contain the status quo. Through the pain of that crisis, that will be the rallying event that we
all get on whatever new page we're going to enter the future following. Yeah, this is 100%. These
are the forces that are at play. What we can do is point to the forces and see those pressures
and understand that over time, that those pressures have to work through the system.
Because those pressures are so extreme, we will be forced to deal with them and to resolve the
bigger structural issues. So I agree with all of that. Now, the problem is path. Because what
we're talking about here is not a one-year, two-year thing. This is a 10 to 15-year process.
If you start to bet on that outcome, and you're looking at your investments and whatnot on a
monthly or quarterly basis or annual basis, you can look back and say, "Is this even happening?
I don't know that this is happening." You have to zoom out and think about it. And the path is not
very, it can be a step function. These things can go one way. Take an example of a step function in
markets as the late 1990s, the tech bubble. Things can go in a crazy, crazy way. And then rebalance
very quickly in a year or two. These cycles when they come to markets and just broad path in
general can be very smooth, as we were mentioning with that Sumo market analogy, and then break
very violently and can lull people into a sense of, "Oh, this isn't really happening." And then
all of a sudden, all the attention is on it all at once. And why does that happen? Why does that
tend to be the case? That's almost always the case, by the way. And it's because there's a
reflexivity to everything. People start to see something happening and they start to bet on the
fact that that will be happening, which then creates a supply and demand imbalance. People
are too far on one side of the cart or the boat. Things become, in terms of supply and demand,
become imbalanced. And positioning, now we get into a bit more of the voting machine.
The positioning of the market in any asset, not just equities, but bonds, gold, you name it,
really is the biggest input to the voting machine. Because if everybody is long something,
that means that at the end of the day, there are a lot more people who need to sell and there are a
lot less people to buy. And that ultimately is what matters in the short term. The outcomes of
things matter in the long run, but in the short term, it's just how many buyers are there versus
how many sellers. So we tend to lead to more and more extreme outcomes. Knowledge, I like to say,
is called dampening. There's this reflexive reality that if people see something coming
in the short term, that dampens the direction of where things are going. And it can lead to,
you need to almost get to a point where people begin to believe, okay, it's not happening again
for it to start to happen again. And this is true for markets in the very short term and much more
important, ultimately, liquidity and this positioning is ultimately probably the most
important thing at the end of the day. And again, both of those are the biggest parts of a supply
and demand calculation. All right. And is it fair to say there's that time honored expression that
the bull market climbs a wall of worry and a bear market goes down a slope of hope where you almost
need to have conventional perception be wrong for the market to then say, all right, look, hold my
bear. I'm going to show why everybody's actually wrong. Exactly. And that's why the market wasn't
ready for this inflationary bout really in 2021, in 2022, sorry. And so we got a 2022, when things
weren't transitory, all of a sudden things went the secular, what I believe is the secular way
of things. Then people adjust and said, oh, this is happening. So guess what? Now there was an
adjustment, the market has to now push back against that positioning for some time. Now,
when people start to say Goldilocks again and you start to hear soft landing, if these things sound
familiar, let me know. There you go. It might be time to start saying, well, now the secular and
the cyclical realities of positioning are starting to line up for another run. But you always have to
think about both when you're thinking about shorter timeframes. You can't just think about
the secular realities. Yes. If you got the last 40 years of monetary policy right, and you understood
the broad cycle, that was probably the most important thing of all, because what did you do?
You bought growth, you sold value, you bought every dip and prepared for the Fed put to come
into things. You focused on China and emerging markets and things that really kind of grew at
a faster rate. All the things that we talked about, you would have benefited from, but guess
what? You would have gotten really hit in 2000, 2001, you would have lost 70% of your portfolio,
you would have lost in 2008, you would have lost 50 to 70% of your portfolio, depending on what
you were in. And so it doesn't mean in the short term that you just willingly just stay long the
secular trend and don't think about things because it'll get you in really dangerous places in
between. But the path- I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just know a lot of people that focus on a
lot of the issues we've been talking about here back in 2006, seven, eight, and positioned for
it back then, and then missed one of the best 10 years in the markets.
Yeah, correct. Correct. And so it's important to be on top of that. In terms of these things,
I think people tend to be early and that's part of the reason. Things take longer than you think
because of reflexivity, because of the positioning. I think people knew about the- I remember in '06,
we were talking about the housing bubble and how it was likely to crash any moment. It didn't crash
until '08. I think the tech bubble, I mean, again, I was around for that. We were talking about that
in '97, '98, it marked a double before it crashed. And things tend to go longer because of this
reflexivity, because of everything that we talk about here. And it's not just the reflexivity of
positioning. More people tend to be, again, positioning in the way of that wall of worry,
but it's also the reflexivity of policy, of the Federal Reserve, of the Treasury,
of policymakers. All of this reflexively acts against the worries of the world and tries to
rebalance. Now, what I will argue is that you can control this stuff in the short term, but
eventually this weighing machine will catch up. So it's important to manage with that broad mental
model to really understand the bigger picture and to bet accordingly, but wait for the opportunities
when people are offsides to that broad thesis to really push on it again and again and again in a
secular way. All right. So I'm working up to, all right, we're at the beginning of a new year. What
is your outlook for the market look like for this year, given both the high macro things that you
look at, as well as just the unfolding developments on the ground. Before we get there real quickly,
is there anything you want to talk about either with derivatives or anything else that, again,
kind of makes this time different from previous times we've been through this cycle? We have
a huge derivative exposure, which you can talk about, but we have markets that are now driven by
algorithms and high-frequency trading and things that can make markets move
faster or perhaps behave differently than they did under similar circumstances in the past.
Yeah, this is a perfect lead-in as we get more and more micro here.
Derivatives were created in the 1970s. People broadly don't understand why derivatives happen
to be developed then and become structurally important. These concepts are much older. Some
of them go back thousands of years, right? Again, derivatives are a form of insurance or a way,
a contract between entities. They're not a magical thing. But why did they become so prominent and
really get listed on exchange to become more used starting in the 1970s? Because of inflation.
The reality is that derivatives, that one of the core principles of derivatives is that you don't
have to outlay money in order to take the exposure, right? That's the whole idea behind it. Why would
people not want to outlay the money to get exposure? Because the cost of money is really
expensive. In the 1970s, the cost of money was very expensive. So people wanted exposure without
laying out the money. They wanted to get their 16% in T-bill in 10 years, right? But they also
wanted certain exposure at that time. And so this allowed a little bit of both. It was efficiency
of capital, which is what really derivatives give you. The thing is they didn't really get used much
until the '80s. And by then, the benefits were not understood and used enough and they weren't
as necessary. But now they're a prominent part of the system. And that efficiency of capital
derivatives really didn't matter that much up until a couple of years ago because you're getting
0% on your money or close. Now in a market environment where you're getting 5.5% in T-bills,
pretty important to be able to get that 5.5% and still get your exposure.
And so a lot of things are coming to the surface here in the last couple of years that we've never
seen before. We're starting to see a massive move, not just in the '70s, money moved from
the stock market into the bond market, right? You had people switching to a higher interest rate,
but they didn't have the ability to stack those returns. And what you're starting to see now is
people say, "Well, I get 5.5% if I go into the bond market, but I could also get 5.5% and then
that's good collateral. I have all these treasury bills. Then I can go stack some returns on top of
that by using that for risk." And that's what structured products are. There has been a massive
growth in structured product issuance from banks and things very similar to them in forms of ETFs
and other things that allow for people to get the 5.5% and then stack another two, four, five,
6% on top of it, depending on the amount of risk they want to take. And that wasn't very
interesting when interest rates are, call it 1%, right? You might've been stacking 4% on 1%. You
were making 5% in a structured product when the market had been returning basically since 2009,
about 12% a year. People were like, "Why would I want those things?" But when the market becomes
more volatile and more dangerous and the market all of a sudden for two years has returned nothing,
right? You kind of look at these things that are now yielding, guess what, 10%, 9.5%, right?
And they're non-correlated, not tied to market outcomes and they're relatively low leverage.
And it's an incredible value proposition, right? So there's this very interesting phenomenon that
during the 1970s, all this money moved out of the stock market into the bond market and really
created more volatility for the stock market almost immediately, created a depression in
multiples, multiple compression and all kinds of other things right away. But now we have actually
a feedback loop that didn't exist, which is now all of this vol compression because there's a lot
of these things that are stacking returns on top of that risk-free are vol compressing. They're
selling some part of the distribution in some way to collect some yield to stack on top of in a low
leveraged way. So now we have all of this vol compression. Banks are now laden with all these
structured products and are long as dealers, all the implied volatility in the market, and they
have to unload that on the market. So there's this vol supply that's happening, this implied
like options and vol supplier are broadly being pushed onto the market in a massive wave because
this is the whole stock market moving slowly into these things. This is leading to structured vol
compression. And ironically, a lot of the forces when you compress volatility, there are natural
mechanisms within the market that lead to a buyback of equities on a daily basis.
And I can go into those. Those are called VONA and charm flows, but as vol compresses,
as the implied vol goes away, the hedges of those tend to be short stock because the market is buying
put, selling call broadly. I can get into more detail if you'd like, but at the end of the day,
there's these structural forces that buy back the market on a daily basis when vol is compressed.
And when risk is well controlled, there's also other funds like vol targeting funds that take
more risk and go more risk on as well. All of these things lead to this market machine
continuing to go into this buy the market, buy the market, climb the wall of worry,
squeeze the shorts, et cetera, in almost a mechanical way as long as this vol supply exists.
And ironically is very counterintuitive. That is a function of interest rates being higher.
How do we know these things are happening? People are like, "Oh, that sounds great,
but how do you actually know these things are happening? Can we tell just because vol is
compressed in this environment?" There are actually other ways to tell.
The most profitable trades in the last three years, and particularly in the last two,
and also we saw this in 2017, which vol was very compressed in a similar fashion,
not from structured products, but other things, was a trade called dispersion.
What is dispersion? Dispersion means how is the performance of the constituents of an index
relative to the index itself? And what we've continued to see is historic three standard
deviation type outcomes for dispersion. And the last time we saw that was really 2017 when we saw
a very similar thing where the indexes was where vol was being sold. The majority of the vol being
sold in markets in these structured products is in the indexes, particularly the S&P 500.
And that S&P 500 vol, when that's sold, what does that mean? That means dealers or entities that
hold that vol are hedging it and pinning the movement and compressing the volatility of that
index. Meanwhile, the actual constituents are moving in line with their historical averages.
Their what we call idiosyncratic risk is very much in line with long-term averages and continues to
be. So, what you see is this real dispersion between the volatility of the entities, the single
list stocks and entities, which is more tied to broad liquidity and interest rates and all the
other risks and the macro things we're talking about. But in the meantime, the middle is pinned.
And that is what we call dispersion. And that is really what explains, and you begin to see again
again when that vol is well supplied and pinning the index, whereas the rest of the market is
moving. And so, that very important structural thing is very different than the 1970s and can
help to extend these cycles a bit, can help to compress the volatility in the short term.
But again, to my point before, it is ultimately like a sumo market. You are unnaturally almost
compressing things through the mechanical measures, compressing volatility, while broad volatility is
increasing on the ends. I call it a donut. Imagine an inner tube is inflating, inflating, but the
middle is pulled down and tightened again with some force. At some point, you blow it up enough,
the whole thing is going to pop. It doesn't matter that the index is pinned in the long run. But in
the short term, it can cause a real headline number like the VIX to look really, really
compressed and indexes to be really, really- Is it a dangerous thing in the long run here?
That's what I'm sort of trying to take from all this, which is, hey, maybe pinning vol to a
certain extent isn't the worst thing in the world. But if you let it run for too long, do you build
up these forces that risk a rupture? Sounds like something else we were talking about earlier with
fire in the underbrush, the reserve and smoothing cycles. Yes, this is the way of the world.
If you continue to let pressures build and don't clear the underbrush, the reaction tends to be
more violent and more dangerous. The more vol is compressed, it gives a green light to speculators
and entities to take more risk. There's all kinds of risks that builds in the system that eventually
creates more of a fire when the fire does come. All right. Let me ask this question just because
we're beginning to run short on time. I know we have a hard stop. We've got to finish before here.
Jim, first off, this is wonderful and I'd love to have you back on the program again to dive
more deeply into any of these topics that you don't feel like we gave full shrift to in this
conversation here. But when I think of things like what you're talking about here, which is
basically artificially compressing volatility to make things look more stable than they truly are
and allow speculation to flourish, there's some other things that we haven't talked about that
we might not have a chance to give full attention to. But the magnitude of corporate buybacks that
are happening now versus previous generations, very different. That's a lot of liquidity flowing
into the system. We have all the fiscal monies that are still in the pipeline that you mentioned
earlier. We have what Mike Green calls the giant mindless robot, which is we have these algorithms
for so much of the passive flows that go into just a small number of stuff. I don't know what
the current number is, but it's close to like 40 cents of every dollar is going into the magnificent
seven. And so all these things conspire to push asset valuations up. And you can look at this from
the scope of history of, all right, well, this is a period where you're pulling tomorrow's prosperity
into today's asset prices. And are you therefore basically setting yourself up for a period of time
at some point in the future where you have to value assets below their historic averages because
you pulled everything into an earlier time? Yeah. So from 1968 to 1982, that 14-year period,
which was the most recent period we have to draw the data from, thought markets went nowhere in
nominal terms. But more important than that, they lost 70% of their value in real terms.
And multiples went from a low 20 P/Es for the broad market to four and a half to give you a
sense. Why is that? Like, why would anybody ever let that... Yeah, it's hard to imagine. Why would
people allow the market to go to a four and a half P that seems like a no brainer? Because you could
get 20% in 10-year bonds. And you have to understand the cost of capital matters. And at the
end of the day, at some point, these valuations are a function of interest rates and interest rates
are a function of inflation. So if we're going to see a secular normalization of interest rates,
we don't even have to talk about the inflation or bigger structural inflation or potential out
there. But the valuations are going to get brought back into line ultimately because there's just
better options. There's better ways to get yield with less risk.
And sorry, just to clarify one thing, in this secular future you see of higher inflation,
you see higher interest rates following suit?
They at some point have to. And the reason they have to is because if they don't,
it creates two problems that make inflation worse. If you artificially suppressed interest rates,
then people can go buy anything pinned down at a lower interest rate knowing that the price of
that thing is going to inflate away. So you can't hold them apart. It will create a massive
inflationary hyperinflation. On top of that, people pull forward broad demand in general,
build inventories, do all kinds of things as has been well-documented. If inflation expectations
go higher, it feeds upon itself and gets out of control. So there is no way for those two things
actually to go in opposite directions. If the Federalists try, it would only create a massively
bigger problem. Got it. All right. So wrapping things up in a criminally short period of time
here, to the question of looking at 2020-2024, where you think markets are headed? Are there
assets that you would favor in this market environment, ones you would avoid? What's
your outlook here? Yeah. So with that context that we are in a secular period, I would call this
almost year two or three of a much longer kind of 15-year type cycle, you're waiting for those
opportunities when people get offsides on that secular view really to continue that secular
trend. And as I alluded to earlier, when you start to hear soft landing and Goldilocks,
that means stagflation is around the corner. And so I think this will be a year of broad
stagflation. I think we are beginning to see recessionary pressures from the cyclical
reaction function to the secular forces. The problem is you can, under these scenarios,
yes, you can take CPI down to 3, maybe even 2% and have a big kind of mission accomplishment across
the back. But the reality is that inflation will not only come back, but will come back much worse
like it did in the 1970s, the second you stimulate cyclically again. And we're already starting to
see signs from the bond market that they believe the Fed will need to pivot. I agree if we go into
a recession, particularly in an election year, even if it's a mild recession, there's going to be some
level of a pivot. There's also going to be a pivot from fiscal policy. There's going to be more
fiscal coming. These things ultimately will drive cyclical now inflationary pressures,
which will align with, again, that secular that's already there and expanding. And so ironically,
these recessionary slowdown periods, when people get their eye off the inflationary picture is when
the trade is the most optimal and the opportunity presents itself. So a lot of these trends,
we saw it back in 2022, I think will continue now this year. They will start turning. I think you'll
see the performance of quality and broad value over growth. Now, again, when I say value,
people will come after me, not the crap value that is like things that need to borrow more money and
that are going to go out of business, but businesses that have good discounted cash flows
that are consumer focused, consumer staples, consumer discretionary stuff, even though it
will look bad initially here as it pulls back. This is an opportunity to now again, structurally
get into that stuff. Commodities, gold is a great opportunity. Volatility itself should begin to
expand again in this year after reaching a nadir. Ironically, if interest rates come down in this
period, that might allow for less structured product issuance, which could actually loosen
a bit of this, what I call the dike boy, the boy with his finger in the dike, holding back the
waters. Or the jack boot that's on the neck of volatility. Exactly. So I think a lot of those
things that we started to see in 2022, which went away in 2023 and really worked the opposite way,
could very much come and rear its head again. And actually an increasingly more veracity,
I believe. It's an election year. And I think that's important to understand. The second we get
a pullback here, which I personally, I believe will be coming sometime here in Q1. When that
happens, the reaction function of both government during an election year, as well as the federal
reserve will be quicker than most people expect and quicker than it would be in most cycles,
which I think will lead to personally, probably some type of blow off top that comes after the
initial pullback. It could be increasingly volatile to the upside before it ultimately
becomes an expanse, a megaphone of types. That would be my guess. But again, at this point,
you want to be favoring anything that's a line item in government. As you mentioned,
times like this put more money into government's hands, whether that's defense industry, whether
that is healthcare, whether that is energy, housing, things that ultimately government
cares about and will be spending into. Those are some of the best places to be secularly in a year
like this. Those will be places I would focus on outside of commodities and again, broad DCF,
high quality names. Fantastic. Real quick, just on bonds, I'm intuiting from what you're saying,
and correct me if I'm wrong here, you think they could actually do okay in the near term as the
current trajectory continues. But once stagflation really starts to kick in,
maybe we have the blow off top and everything, that's a time to start getting out of bonds
and putting that into things that are going to do well from a reflation trade.
Yeah. To be clear, duration is a dangerous game to play in this secular environment. You can
get out of the bond short for periods. Again, you would have wanted to be here more recently
when things get on one side of the boat, but you want to be looking for a steepener.
This has been a very, very rare occurrence that you've seen steepening into a time when the Fed
is starting to really lower maybe pivot on interest rates. My view is that after the
initial pivot comes, that you'll ironically see not only a bottoming in longer term yields,
but you'll start to see a real steepening of the curve, which hasn't happened for 40 years.
And I think that something along those lines will be the sign that the Fed is starting to
lose a little bit of control along the curve. And I think that is actually going to be the biggest
risk to everything when things really start to get a little bit more dangerous.
All right. That's the Bill Fleckenstein, the bond market starting to take the printed press out of
the hands of the Fed. Jim, next time you're back on, let's dive more deeply into this risk here,
because it sounds like a big concern of yours for the future, and we hardly had any time to
talk about it. All right. Landing the plane here very quickly in the remaining few seconds we have.
Very important question. For folks that have really enjoyed this conversation,
maybe it's the first time they've been exposed to your work, Jim,
where can they follow you in your work? Yeah. The name of the firm is CHI Volatility. You can
go to chivolatility.com. We offer a family of hedge funds, primarily focused on some of the
all these forces that we talk about in volatility markets particularly. You can also find me on
Twitter or X @jam_croissant. That's a play on my name. I usually post a lot of things there,
and we do a lot of media much like this. But happy to be back when we have time,
Adam, and kind of dive in a bit more. Fantastic. This has been just great. So folks,
to help encourage Jim to come back on the program, please vote your support for that by hitting the
like button, then clicking on the red subscribe button below, as well as that little bell icon
right next to it. Last question for you here in our last 30 seconds, Jim. We've been talking a
lot about financial monetary investment issues here. Is there one non-financial, non-money
related investment that you would encourage folks to consider adopting in their lives in 2020?
Yeah. This may sound a little hokey, but if you couldn't tell, I'm a student of history and a
student of broad philosophy, and I think too often we get focused on ourselves and our own financial
outcome, and we don't think about the bigger picture. That's part of the bigger problem.
So I would invest in your community. I'd invest in the people around you and try and educate and
do things that ultimately help for the greater good. I think that's the most important thing of
all. Very well said, and we'll leave it there because I know you got to go. Jim, this has just
been a true joy. Thanks so much for coming back on. Really look forward to doing this again in
the future. Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
