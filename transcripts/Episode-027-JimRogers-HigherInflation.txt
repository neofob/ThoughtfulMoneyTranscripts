Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
I'm battling a pretty bad head cold right now, folks, so thanks for hanging with me
with my scratchy voice here.
The past few years have been full of surprises, often going the exact opposite way that Wall
Street expected at the start of each year.
Well, as we prepare to enter 2024, it may help to tap the expertise of those investors
who have been around the longest and been the most successful.
High on that list is Jim Rogers, legendary international investor, financial commentator,
and author of several bestselling books on wealth building.
Jim, thanks so much for coming on the program today, all the way from Singapore.
I am delighted to be here, Adam.
Your introduction really means people who are old, who've been around because they're
old.
Well, that is-
I've been around partly because I'm old.
That is highly correlated with wisdom.
So-
By the way, I'm delighted to be old.
I can think of the alternative, so I'm very happy.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm very happy that you're old and that you're, we'll say, long in the tooth, but Jim, you
were one of the youngest at heart people I know, and I know it's mourning your time,
but something tells me you're going to be hitting some of the nightclubs out there in
Singapore before too, hunk.
I got to go to the disco.
You're right.
What would I do otherwise?
Well, look, you're an inspiration to all of us.
Look, a number of questions, very excited to have you back on here.
Last couple of times we've talked, you have said that you were very concerned about the
macro situation.
I seem to remember comments like, "We may have the worst bear market of your lifetime."
I want to get into your latest status on that, whether you still think the same or not, but
if we can start just a little bit higher first, which is what's your current assessment of
the global economy in financial markets?
Let me quickly clarify what I have said, and I will say again, the next time we have a
bear market, and I don't know when it's coming, thoughtful money they know, but I know we're
going to have more bear markets, and I know that the next one is going to be the worst
in my lifetime.
Adam, 2008 was a problem because of too much debt.
Look out the window.
Since 2008, the debt has skyrocketed everywhere.
Even China has a lot of debt now.
So all I'm saying is, and I don't know when it's coming, that the next time it's going
to be a nasty, horrible, disastrous bear market.
Now how I see the world right now, one of the things that history has taught us is the
year before an American election, usually the American market is fairly strong, and
that's because all the politicians know the election is coming, and so they try to make
everybody happy.
You pull out all the stops, right?
Yes.
And it's happened again.
I mean, we had 2023.
It has been a reasonably good year in most markets around the world, but we're talking
about Americans, certainly in the American market.
So now, now what?
Your question is now what?
Yes, yes, yes.
History is great for 2023, but what about 2024?
Well, first of all, it's the longest period in American history without a profit.
We have never had such a long period.
Adam, it doesn't mean it won't go on 40 years.
I have no idea.
It never has, but who knows?
But I'm starting to see signs, and by the way, I have not sold anything short.
I do have a lot of cash, but I've not been shorting.
I'm starting to see signs.
You see the signs that fewer and fewer shares are going up.
They go up every day.
Some shares go up every day.
A lot of new people are coming into the market, inexperienced people coming in, and they all
talk about how much fun it is and how easy it is to make money.
Well, it's never been easy for me, but if it's easy for somebody, that's probably a
bad sign.
I see some of the signs, the debt is skyrocketing, some of the signs that have happened before,
so I'm worried, but I'm not shorting yet.
Often, at the end of a long bull market, there's a blow off where everything just skyrockets.
I don't know if we're going to have one again, but I'm waiting in case we do, and I hope
I'm smart enough to short it if it happens.
Okay.
Let's actually talk about that really quickly.
If you see that blow off spike, and I have been talking to people recently, Jim, that
have been bringing up historical precedent, which shows that the markets really get into
party mode, usually right before the end, or right prior to a big correction.
Most of the recessions we've gone into, the stock market has partied right up into them.
If you start seeing those same signs of a manic melt up, you're actually going to be
shorting into that, or are you going to wait to see it fail, and then start to get in on
shorts?
How do you time your shorts?
Adam, I'm the worst market timer in the world, are you asking me?
I'm just curious.
You said you were going to short, so I'm curious what you're looking for.
If it happened this way, if we do start seeing the blow off period, I will be shorting into
the blow off.
Okay.
But I will be too soon, I promise you I'll be too soon.
Yeah, and folks who are watching, I've talked a lot in this program with a lot of people
about the risks of shorting, yet your timing has to be really right.
Jim is highly experienced, and I would venture to say can afford losses more than the average
viewer on this channel, so if you're going to go short into a mania, be very, very careful
about it.
Ideally, use some hedges to protect you in case your short bets are wrong.
And your other question, part of your question was maybe you should wait until it fails,
and that is sometimes an extremely good way to do things.
Okay.
Well, kind of at the heart of what I believe to be your macro outlook, Jim, is debt, which
you've already mentioned a couple of times here, and it's been growing exponentially
over the decades.
I mean, I think we had something like $9 trillion in federal debt going into the global financial
crisis, and we're what, $33 trillion now, and of course that's just on the federal side.
So what I don't see happening there is a, I just don't see a lot of potential for that
exponential growth trajectory to flatten out at all.
In fact, to a certain extent, it's a feature, not a bug of a fiat monetary system where
money is borrowed into existence, but also, as you know, politicians, they're always going
to spend and kick the can down the road if they're able to.
So my question is, do you sort of see all this ending in an inevitable default of the
currency versus a default of the bad debts?
You can kind of tackle a debt problem one of two ways.
You can let the bad debts default or you can just print.
Well unfortunately, not unfortunately, the US dollar is the world's main currency.
Now unfortunately, that's beginning to change because more and more people are starting
to see that the US debt goes skyrocketing.
And in Washington, Adam, if you have the world's reserve currency, it's supposed to be neutral.
Nobody can use it for anything.
But unfortunately, Washington is now changing those rules.
If Washington gets angry at you, they cut you off.
They say you cannot use the US dollar.
Many people, including our friends, are starting to say, "Wait, wait, wait, wait.
This is serious.
It could happen to us.
It could happen to anybody."
And so many people are now, because of Washington, are starting to accelerate to look for something
else to compete with the dollar, including me, I'm looking to.
I don't see anything on the horizon, yet should be the Chinese currency.
But it's a blocked currency, so it cannot be the Chinese renminbi.
And I don't know.
I own a lot of US dollars, and I own them because I know that in turmoil, people look
for a safe haven, and they will think the US dollar is a safe haven.
But as I just said, that's coming to an end.
So now I and others are accelerating the search for what do we do next?
What do we use if we cannot use dollars?
And Adam, if you know, don't announce it on the show.
Send me an email.
Send me a private email.
I'm looking.
Oh, you first.
Okay.
Well, I think you've answered where I was going here.
But let me just draw a delineation.
There's what's likely to happen in the near term, and I agree with you, Jim.
I don't think the US dollar is going anywhere.
It's still the best course in the glue factory, whichever analogy you want to use.
My question was sort of more on the longer time, the scope of the couple of decades from
out here.
Does this exponential growth in debt end in essentially hyperinflation of all the major
world fiat currencies?
Because the US is not unique in this, right?
And if it does, you're nodding as I'm saying this.
So if it does, if that is the long term, and again, Jim, you might not be around for this.
I might not be around for this.
What does that world look like, do you think?
And I'm just asking you to totally speculate here.
Do we go back to try another fiat system, some sort of global world currency?
Or do we go back to hardbacking?
Do we say, look, we did the fiat experiment.
It didn't work.
We're going to come back with something that's a little more tied to reality.
Well, what has happened in the last reserve currency was British pound.
You know, in 1923, the British pound was, it was it.
There was no competitor.
There was no number two.
Fifty years later, 1976 to be exact, Britain went bankrupt.
IMF had to fly into Heathrow and pay their bills.
It was that serious.
That is a currency that went from number one to 50 years later, bankrupt.
That's what happened.
During that period of time, you know, it was miserable in Britain.
You couldn't take money out of the country.
You could take only a little bit if you went on a foreign trip, you know, with the value
of the currency went down almost every week.
There were serious exchange controls.
There were high debts, high interest rates.
Britain was a disaster.
Now, Adam, there were always people who did well in Britain, even.
I mean, the Beatles didn't leave, the Beatles stayed and made a lot of money.
But most people who were in Britain in those 50 years did not have a good time.
That is what's always happened in currency, countries and currencies which go through
this.
Am I looking forward to it?
No, but I'm just saying what has happened in the past.
And I don't see how we, we the US can avoid that.
Maybe you have an answer.
And people will in those days moved from the British pound to the US dollar.
My problem is I don't know where to move, which currency to move to now, because I don't
see another one.
Right.
And I'm kind of with you right there.
And, you know, in 1976, the US dollar was fully fiat, but it was still kind of coasting,
you know, on the momentum of having been tied to gold.
So it wasn't as abused as I think it's become to date.
So there was a credible alternative there.
I guess where I'm going with this is if neither of us sees a good fiat substitute waiting
in the wings, I know you've written a lot in your career about commodities, does that
lead you to still be quite optimistic about commodities as people look to preserve purchasing
power in the long run?
By the way, in the 1970s, the United States was still a creditor nation.
I know it's a shock, because the US was still a creditor nation in 1970s, believe it or
not.
Well, when these things happen, of course, real assets do better than fiat money, because
people want something real, whether it's gold or cotton or whatever it happens to be.
And so yes, it will be another push for people to own real assets.
I don't like any of this, Adam, but I have to face facts.
And so it will help real assets, commodities, more than anything, more than other things.
Okay, good.
And those were the things that I wanted to sort of validate with you here since we last
talked, which is yes, you still see that when the next big correction happens, it is likely
to be the biggest of your lifetime and I'm taking from that, Jim, is because the system
is so distorted here.
It's almost like if you pull an elastic band further than you've ever pulled it, you're
going to have the biggest snapback that you've ever had.
And then secondly, you are still optimistic about commodities for the reasons that we've
talked about in the past.
In the short term, and again, I want to delineate timeframes for people.
In the short term, paper may still be where the game is being played in terms of returns
in the market.
And certainly 2023 was an example of that.
Great year for stocks, ended up seeing a real catch up moment for bonds here at the end
of the year too.
And like you said, you're seeing a lot of exuberance going back into the markets here.
So it doesn't mean that we're going to fall into this world tomorrow of dollar collapse
and commodities finally having their big run.
So I just want to make sure that people are aware that neither of us here is calling for,
hey, sell everything tomorrow and just go into sacks of flour and coffee and stuff like
that.
But I guess you're saying that you're concerned about current valuations.
You're concerned about the increasing, maybe lack of, or you're concerned about the degree
of speculation that seems to be flooding into the markets right now.
And you talked about sort of the retail investor that tends to be kind of a hallmark, right?
Which is the retail investor sort of tends to be the patsy that shows up at the end of
the party, right?
Adam is not just retail investor, it happens to all of us, you know, I wish the retail
investors were the only bad investors or the only ones who make mistakes.
Everybody makes mistakes.
And I just wanted to go back to what you were commenting.
I repeat, I do own a lot of U.S. dollars right now.
I don't see a great future, but I see a lot of U.S. dollars in my portfolio because I
see problems coming.
And usually people think the U.S. dollar is a safe haven when there are serious problems.
Got it.
And when you're holding it in the U.S. dollar, are you holding it in cash equivalents like
treasuries?
And if you are, what's your breakdown between short duration, like super safe T-bills, but
long duration?
Because if people do rush into treasuries for safety, there is an argument to be made
to play the long end for that, too.
Adam, I'm too lazy for all of that.
I mainly use money market funds now.
They're very simple.
And I'm lazy.
Your strategy, it sounds like, is make the easy money, stay liquid, stay out of the game
because you don't like valuations.
And then when there are better valuations, you'll have your dry powder to deploy.
Right.
The only thing I worry about is your term, easy money.
There's never been any easy money in my career in the industrial world.
Where is this easy money?
Where can I find it?
Oh my, I want some of it.
All right.
Well, let me ask you a couple of questions first.
So it's been kind of a heck of a year from the central planning standpoint, right?
We had a higher for longer or pretty much the entire year, although we just had Powell
basically seem to give the market a nod that he's going to start going back to rate cuts
next year more than the market was currently expecting.
As part of that higher for longer, we ended up seeing some real weakness in the banking
system that forced the Fed and the treasury to get involved.
What do you see going forward here from the central planners?
Do you see them continuing to sort of try to stage manage this economy?
Do you think the soft landing, no landing that Powell was talking about is actually
possible to engineer at this point?
I'll end there and let you go.
Well, first of all, I hasten to tell you that in America, we've had three central banks
in American history.
The first two disappeared for many reasons, and some of them are going to disappear too
someday because they keep making so many mistakes.
But we haven't had, I can only think of a couple of good central bankers in our history
and since 1913.
And Powell is not one of them.
He's not on my list of a good central banker.
So I have learned, you have to listen to them because they have influence, but I have learned
they don't know what they're doing.
So don't think that they know what they're doing and what they say is accurate.
It's not.
Now, the problem is you have to figure out what's accurate then, so they're not right.
And we can't just take their word for it.
We have to figure out what's going to happen.
My suspicion, but it's only a suspicion, is that inflation, you know, markets will do
like this.
They go up, they correct, they go up, they correct.
That's been happening with inflation.
Inflation has been correcting, as all markets do.
I would suspect, though, that by this time next year, inflation will have reared into
the ugly head, even to the public.
And we will all be wondering, what do we do now?
And that interest rates will be going higher again.
I hope Mr. Powell can cut rates and I hope he's smart enough to do it if that's appropriate.
But I don't have much confidence.
You know, so much money has been printed in the last few years.
I mean, just unbelievable amounts of money, and not just in the U.S., although we led
the way.
But the Bank of Japan, I mean, it's unbelievable, a guy goes to work every day like a good Japanese
bureaucrat, goes early, cranks up the printing presses, and prints money as fast as he can.
The amount of money being printed in Japan is unbelievable.
It's unbelievable in America too, has been anyway.
But that's happening all over the world now.
So I am worried that inflation has not gone away for good.
You took it exactly where I wanted to go, which is you see, you know, probability of
inflation resurging, which may also be accompanied by the central banks either re-tightening
or maybe just the bond market itself, you know, starting to raise the longer end of
the curve so interest rates could come back up.
Let me ask you about your comments there about the monetary easing.
What's been so interesting to me is this year, this past year and a half, the narrative has
been, hey, we're in a tightening cycle, right, Fed's raising hiking interest rates more than
it's ever done.
And it's doing QT to the tune of a trillion dollars.
But if you look at net liquidity in the system, it's actually been rising since October 2022.
And I think that that explains a lot in terms of how the markets have performed, right?
Once net liquidity flows reversed pretty much at the same time.
So did the markets and they powered higher all year along with liquidity.
So you talk about the central banks are now, you know, they've got their hammer, monetary
stimulus.
What's been different this time around to your point about the gargantuan amount of
stimulus that we did during COVID has been the addition of the fiscal side of things,
right?
And we have a ridiculous fiscal spending situation going on right now in a lot of countries, certainly
in the US.
And my question for you is, you know, just like the bear that, you know, subsists on
berries, but once he gets a taste of meat, he doesn't want to ever eat berries again,
right?
You know, are we in a new world where both politicians and the public, when anything
starts to go wrong, just demands stimulus from all sides?
Because hey, we did it before, if we did it, then we should do it now.
I am delighted that you pointed out the fiscal situation because yes, not just the US, but
especially the US has been unbelievable amounts of money, borrowed unbelievable amounts and
spent unbelievable.
I mentioned Japan before.
I mean, Japan's got a huge economy and they're doing it too.
Many people are doing it.
So we have both monetary, always, we've had a monetary situation and a fiscal situation.
And at the moment, I mean, Adam, it's a good time to be an old American because young Americans
are going to have a huge, huge problem someday with all this money that's being borrowed
and spent.
I mean, the numbers are mind-boggling.
So it's a good thing we're older than 22.
Yes, but we have children.
We worry about the world that we're leaving to them.
I do though think about that Teitler quote and I'm going to butcher it here, but it's
something like, "Democracies can only last as long as up until the point the public realizes
it can vote itself largesse from the treasury."
And I do worry that we may have just sort of crossed that line with the pandemic worldwide
and that that will be the operating, that will be the MO for any crisis going forward
until we have perhaps just really destroyed the currencies.
I suspect someday we're along the line.
Somebody is going to run in a basis of, "We've got to do something about this debt."
And everybody, the voters, you and me are all going to say, "He's right.
Let's elect him."
And then we will elect him, but then six months later, we're all going to say, "Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
This hurts too much.
What are you talking about?
This is gigantic pain.
This is torture.
Now get rid of it and we'll print more money."
That's what often has happened in history.
Totally very true.
And I think we are kind of our own worst enemies here as humans, politicians as humans.
Their incentive is to kick the can down the road.
Any problem that can happen today, better to waste off on somebody else in the future.
And as a populace, we generally want the easy fix and demand the easy fix and say, "Hey,
we'll deal with the repercussions later on."
Of course, we like it when we have to.
So I do worry that we're just not well fit as a species to deal with an exponential debt
crisis.
It's just not in our wheelhouse.
But I'm curious.
I love your thoughts.
Go ahead.
If I could just interject for a minute and go back to use the Japanese model because
it is a gigantic economy, the second or third largest in the world.
They have staggering amounts of debt and they have a declining population.
That's not a typo.
Declining population for several years, debt going through the roof.
And every day they go deeper and deeper into debt and they print more and more money.
Now these are successful, educated people.
Like Americans, like people in ... Well, I guess the people in Washington are successful
and educated people.
But in Japan, we have educated, successful people.
And I say to myself, "How can they do this?
How can they go every day and print more money and run up higher and higher and higher debt
with a population in decline at them?"
They do it.
They do it.
They're human beings too, just like you, all of us.
And it is happening before our eyes.
So strange things can happen with politicians and always have throughout history.
And don't think the people in Washington are any smarter.
They never have been.
Don't worry, Jim, at least not on my end.
I don't have that overconfidence in them.
Well, look, I'm curious on this, especially since you have an interesting perspective
sitting out of the US, but having grown up here, what do you think about what's going
on in Argentina right now?
And forgive me, the cold men's Eman, my brain's a little foggy.
I can't remember the name of the new president there.
But the guy who basically said, "Look, let's break the cycle of hyperinflation here.
Let's get rid of the central bank, peg our currency to the US dollar and go from there."
Well, yes, he said a lot of wonderful things.
Fortunately, I've been around Argentina a long time and I've heard it many times, many
times where the Argentinians elect a new guy or somebody comes riding in on a white horse
with very sound policies and actually does them.
And they have reverted or converted to the US dollar at times in their history.
It's not my first rodeo, Adam.
I've seen this movie in Argentina before and he says wonderful things.
Let's see, we can ask me in three years, ask me in five years, but it's perfect.
He's saying all the right things.
He's saying good things, not all, but mainly what he's saying is very sound.
Let's see.
Yeah.
And I know to a lot of people listening, we probably sound pretty pessimistic.
I guess to a certain extent we are, but I do at the end of the day have the faith that
I think it was Winston Churchill said.
He said it about Americans, but I think it's basically true of humans in general, which
is you can always count on us to do the right thing after we've exhausted every other potential
option out there.
And the question really is how much pain are we willing to endure before the pain of change
is less than the pain of maintaining the status quo?
And sadly, history generally tends to show it can be super high.
I just finished, sorry to go off here a little bit on tangent, but I just finished this new
series on Netflix following World War II.
And it's great because it's sort of like a World War II for dummies.
It's six episodes.
It gives you a good sense of what happened timeline wise, but it's all done from local
footage that's been colorized and restored, oftentimes using AI.
It's really pretty amazing.
But you see what's going on inside Germany there, and you're just like, my God, how did
those people go along with all that?
But to your points earlier, Jim, it tends to sometimes be like a creep where the increment
of every day is not shocking enough to get you to change your behavior.
It's only when you found yourself down the road long enough and have said, my God, what
have we done is when you potentially start reevaluating.
Well, I guess you actually hit the nail on the head when you said each day is not enough
of a change, and you barely notice it.
Six months later, six years later, you say, oh, my gosh, how did this happen?
What do we do now?
And I guess that's the way human beings are.
You have the same insights that other smart people do.
OK.
All right.
Eventually, eventually it happens, and we throw in the towel and say, we've got to do
something.
Yeah.
And again, to my question, how much pain do we need to take before we actually get to
that decision?
I don't think we're anywhere near that point yet simply because we're not having a conversation
about it.
We're the addict that hasn't admitted they have a problem yet.
So until you do that, at least, nothing's possible.
Adam, the American stock market is at all-time highs.
What pain?
Yeah.
What pain are you talking about?
That's what you'll get.
Now, of course, and Jim, I don't know how much of this you see.
There is a lot of fracturing, I would say, of the social of society here in the US where
you're seeing more.
You're starting to see a lot more pushback, especially on the working class, in the middle
classes about how hard it is to get by with the increase in the cost of living.
And to a certain extent, some of the losses of freedoms that have come along with some
of the crises that we've had over the past years.
But that's a really good question too, which is what might we hit first, a financial crisis
or a social crisis where you have enough people that the system just really stops working
for, that they take matters into their own hands in a certain way?
I'm not expecting pitchforks and torches and civil war or anything, but certainly revolt
at the election box and other things like that.
Well, if I look out the window, I see basically full employment.
I see the stock market at all time has.
I see, I know everybody's complaining, including me, but the simple facts are huge employment,
stock market is going through the roof.
Everybody can get a job if she wants, if he wants, from what I read anyway.
Well, sorry, let me just push back on that so you can address it in your continued answer.
That's all true.
I'm not denying any of that and I'm being increasingly convinced by the people that
I've been interviewing of late who are saying, look, the recession is just not in the data
right now.
But the things you mentioned, stock market at all time highs, yeah, but 90% of financial
wealth is owned by the top 10% of households, right?
Low employment, yeah, it's low, but there's over a hundred million working age Americans
that are not considered to be in the labor force, right?
So there's a lot being masked at the same time and I'm not trying to paint a picture
that the country's tipping into civil unrest tomorrow.
I'm just saying, if we just look at those headline numbers, it doesn't necessarily tell
the full story.
But usually in history, there comes a time when even the headlines are, oh my God, what
do we do next?
You remember Cox's army in the 30s, military veterans marched on Washington.
I'm talking about the United States of America, American military veterans marched on Washington
called Cox's army.
Things were pretty bad.
And those headlines are not happening now.
Absolutely true.
And I guess to your point about whenever it happens, four months from now, four years
from now, 40 years from now, whatever, we get that worst correction of your lifetime.
Do you see the danger of that type of social fracture?
About history, what we are seeing now and can see and may well see has led to social
fracturing, whether we like it or not.
You mentioned Argentina before.
Argentina's had serious collapses at times and huge social fracturing.
But everybody has, everybody.
The United States of America has at times.
We have, although not so much in living memory that much anymore.
No, no, no, it's not, no, and I'm glad it's not in living memory.
That's wonderful.
Me too.
But at the same time, we may not have enough, the resilience that some other countries like
Argentina do that this is a every couple of year thing for them, every 10 years.
But I will just, you know, the United States is the largest debtor nation in the history
of the world, et cetera.
I hope that we never have any problems that other countries have had in situations like
this.
Okay.
The reason I'm digging into this with you, Jim, is you are a student of history and you
also live outside the US.
You've seen regime change and you guys just had it not that long ago in Sri Lanka, right?
Where that was pretty extreme, regime change, et cetera.
So you live in a part of the world where this isn't necessarily an academic topic, right?
So you truly know what can happen here.
And again, I'm not trying to scare people or say that it's, again, happening tomorrow,
but I value your perspective because I think you have a much closer finger to the pulse
of really what's happening sort of in grand cycles than most people.
I hope you will try to scare people.
I hope you will, because Adam, if people are scared, they will become knowledgeable.
And if they become knowledgeable, they will be prepared.
And if you're prepared, you can survive anything.
So I hope you will scare people.
I hope you don't tell everybody, don't worry, everything is fine.
Things are great, I hope.
And even if they are, Adam, people should at least be aware of all the facts and know
what's going on.
Absolutely.
And that's part of the balance I've been trying to get back to in this conversation.
A lot of these risks we're talking about are long-term risks and I don't want to give people
the sense that we're saying this is all happening tomorrow.
In other words, we might have a great bull run in the market for the next quarter or
whatever.
And I don't want to give people the impression that they got to sell everything tomorrow
and go straight to the bunker, if you will.
All right.
We'll look at the last sort of scary topic and then we'll start to wind it up here, Jim.
Again, you are a commodities expert.
Your command of natural resources is legendary, literally.
We've talked about some of these challenges that the world faces.
You talked about the weaponization of the financial industry that's now sort of part
of the geopolitical playbook.
How concerned are you about wars going forward as we are having this shift from a fairly
unipolar Pax Americana to a more Team America and Team BRICS, if you will, as countries
begin to compete more and more for these resources?
Do you think the market will sort of take care of things or are you worried that the
competition could heat up in ways that we wouldn't like?
Adam, I'm always worried.
I invest in the markets.
If you invest in the markets and you're not always worried, you don't know what's going
on.
But let me just go back to something you said, Pax Americana.
Yes, Washington puts out that propaganda.
But there was a study done recently.
The United States has been a country since 1776.
In all but 18 years, we have been at war.
It's a horrifying fact.
It's a fact.
It's a simple, historic fact.
We are always at war with somebody.
So I'm not proud of this at all.
It worries me even more.
But for some reason, those people in Washington like war.
We're not very good at it anymore.
We haven't won a war in a long time.
But they like it.
And so Pax Americana worries me.
And that's the way many people in Washington think.
They think, we'll show them, we'll give them peace, we'll send an army to give them peace.
So I worry about a lot of things.
And that's one of them that somehow or another, we, the American, we might stumble into a
war for those people in Washington like it.
Well let me ask your opinion on this.
So this is very germane to the topic, which is the week we're talking here, Houthi rebels
in the Red Sea have attacked Western shipping barges, tankers.
And basically trade is now shut through the Suez Canal.
And that's kind of a knock on effect of what's going on in Israel here.
So we have these sort of flash points that seem to be happening with maybe more frequency
than we would like that aren't just necessarily regional squabbles that they can pull the
big guys in.
And certainly cutting off the Suez Canal, that's 12% of the global trade.
So those ships are going to find their way to their ports eventually, but at like a 40%
increase in time delay and cost, that's going to be inflationary.
So the circulatory system of the global economy can be very disrupted the more that geopolitics
become contentious.
And I'm just curious how much of this worries you going forward?
Will we see more of it than we've seen, say, in the past 30 years?
How much it worries me?
It worries me enormously.
I've just got to tell you, Washington has always been at war.
And before the First World War in 1914, the German royal family and the English royal
family used to vacation together.
They would have parties together.
They would intermarry, et cetera.
And then in 1914, only a few months later, they were slaughtering each other, hating
each other, the whole world.
And everybody, of course, in October of 1914 said, don't worry, this will be over by Christmas.
And of course, six months later, everybody was saying, how the hell did we get into this?
How do we get out?
How do we get out of this crazy war?
And it took four years, disaster, gigantic disaster.
So when these accidents happen, whatever reason-- and by the way, in that war, just a little
history more than you care about, probably-- but the king, the emperor of Germany said
to Serbia-- the emperor of Austria said to Serbia, because his son had been killed, assassinated
in Serbia, these are non-demands.
You must do these things.
Serbia agreed to eight of them.
Serbia agreed to eight of the demands from the archduke of-- what was he called?
The arch, something, the emperor of Austria.
Serbia agreed, said, OK, we'll do it, to eight of his non-demands.
The old man, he was 86 years old, said, too bad, I'm going to slaughter you all.
And the next thing you know, we were all in this gigantic war that could not end for four
years.
So these things happen.
And you just mentioned, sure, I see what's going on in the Red Sea, you see what's going
on, and who knows what we could stumble into.
Most wars happened by people as make mistakes and by accidents.
And then a few months later, everybody says, how do we get out?
The problem is, Adam, how do we get out of wars once they start?
It's bad enough that they start.
But then the problem is we can't get out.
Right.
Look at Vietnam.
Vietnam was all based on fraud in Washington.
It went on for over a decade and we couldn't get out.
My daughter, my older daughter was born on the day that we invaded Afghanistan.
And it was crazy when she turned 20.
And I realized, oh, my God, that war is still going on.
That war is exactly as old as my daughter.
Really creepily, that same day, October 7th, was the day that Hamas attacked Israel.
So now that war is tied to her birthday as well, which is crazy.
It's your daughter's fault.
All of this is your daughter's fault.
Now we know.
Maybe we have the world's scapegoat now.
Exactly.
All right.
Well, look, now that we've completely freaked everybody out, let's bring it back to there's
not a ton that we as individuals can do about what the great powers decide to do geopolitically.
But we can control how we can react to them.
And assuming for a moment that things continue as they are for at least the foreseeable short
term, it sounds from what I'm hearing from you, I want to ask about your market outlook
and how you're positioning.
It sounds like your market outlook is, hey, things are richly valued.
You expect some sort of pullback at some time.
You're largely sitting in cash.
You're planning to do some shorting when you see the froth really get crazy.
Is there anything else you would add to that description?
You did a very good job, better job than I did.
OK, so basically you're playing it safe right now.
I don't know if I'm playing it safe, maybe I'm playing it foolish.
Maybe I should be 100% invested right now, but I am worried.
I've seen this rodeo before.
This has been going on since 2009, the longest in American history.
I see signs that I've seen before, but maybe I'm going to wait too long.
My timing is usually pretty bad.
So I guess everybody should listen to Adam.
Well, look, in full disclosure, the video that's going to have run right before this
one, Jim, is with Darius Dale, who has a very detailed model where his opinion doesn't come
into play in terms of portfolio allocation.
It's just what the model says he should do.
And that's saying that the next three months, it's clear sailing.
And he very well may be true.
You yourself said, hey, you think this could get even frothier.
And so I just want to highlight for folks why we have different voices on this channel.
We have some people like Darius who are very technical, just looking at the market as it
is.
And then we have people like Jim who have decades and decades of market experience and
lots of success investing, who have the perspective of having seen many of these cycles and being
able to see patterns and things like that.
And there's also different ways to invest.
Some people might say, hey, I'm just going to surf three months out because that's what
I've got confidence I can see.
And I would say Lance Roberts, who's one of the financial advisors that this channel refers
people to, that's more of his mantra.
But then there are other people like you, Jim, who say, I look for big turning points
and I'm happy not really overstretching myself until I feel like the odds are better than
normal that I can make some money here.
I hope that I make many mistakes, Adam.
I wish it were that simple.
I wish it were that simple.
Wouldn't it be wonderful?
Adam, I'd even be happy to have good luck.
I wish luck could come to help me sometime.
Well, you know, Jim, I got to say, having talked to a lot of people like yourself who
have been capital managers, the honest ones have said luck plays a pretty big role in
this industry.
Like, really, we're really out there trying to hit consistent singles and doubles and
maybe for lucky we get a triple.
But the home runs are rare and most of the time it's something that we didn't think necessarily
was going to be a home run.
And yeah, we all hope for the year where we have an amazing return that we can brag about
at the end of the year.
But if we're honest with ourselves that that's just luck.
And for most people who are looking for a capital manager, again, this is where our
evolutionary wiring works against us.
We look at the guy who had a great year, he outperformed, so we say, I want to be with
that guy.
Right?
Well, we just got his lucky year.
So, you're highly likely to basically have reversion of the mean come into play soon
after.
Well, he'll underperform.
Right?
You know a lot about markets, I can tell.
Well, that's just from interviewing guys like you, Jim.
It's not your first rodeo either.
Not my first rodeo, but like you though, I'd take some luck if it were offered to me.
All right.
Well, look, I want to start wrapping things up here.
I want to, if I can, two last questions for you.
The second one I'm going to ask right after I do some housekeeping and that one just so
you can noodle on it is, we've talked a lot about building wealth right now.
What's a non-money related investment that you would encourage people to develop in their
life or adopt?
I've been asking this question recently and I've really been enjoying the answers that
I've been getting.
But before I ask you that question, for folks that have really enjoyed this conversation,
Jim, and would like to follow you, where can they go?
I don't have anything, Adam.
I don't have any newsletter or anything.
I'm just a simple person trying to make a living.
Should they just search on Jim Rogers?
Well, I have there's jimrogers.com, but that's not much there.
You would not go, "No, I'm getting you hot tips from jimrogers.com."
That's just a simple, that's my schedule mainly.
I went around the world a couple of times.
It's part of one of my trips.
No, I don't have anything to sell, Adam.
No, but you have a lot of wisdom to give.
So I'm going to, when I edit this, Jim, I will put up an overlay where I just have searched
Jim Rogers, at least do a news search, because when you do make these interview appearances,
that often gets covered in the media.
So if folks want to stay on track of what you're seeing, that's a good way for them
to do that.
All right, Jim, we're here at this last question.
You've got daughters.
I've got daughters.
We've talked about this in the past of some of the life advice that we like to try to
give them.
But what's a non-monetary investment you would encourage folks watching this video here to
consider investing in or exploring once they're done watching this?
Beware of boys, beware of boys.
But no, the other thing I try, I guess the thing I try to teach them most is to persevere.
We all know people who are smart, who are not successful.
We know educated people are not successful.
We know talented people are not successful.
The people who are successful in the end, in most people's lives, are the nuts who just
never give up.
So the one word, the most important word I'm trying to teach my daughter is persevere,
persevere, persevere.
Great, great recommendation.
One of my favorite books, Jim, was Grit by Alex Duckworth, which is exactly about the
importance of perseverance.
And really when you look at test scores and things like that in the education system,
yes, there's some correlation, but not nearly as much as we think in terms of life success.
In fact, the people who tend to succeed the most in life, we're not the curve wreckers
in school.
But these are people who just have tenacity, discipline, commitment, and the ability to,
what's the old saying?
It's not how many times you get knocked down, it's how many times you get back up.
So fantastic, fantastic recommendation.
All right, Jim.
Well, look, it's always a true pleasure to have you on.
Thank you so much.
Enjoy the disco.
I'm delighted.
It's always fun with you, Adam, persevere.
Thank you.
All right.
Well, now's the time of the channel.
We'll be bringing the lead partners from New Harbor Financial, one of the endorsed financial
advisory firms by Thoughtful Money, to both react to what I discussed with Jim, but also
give us their latest view on the markets, especially as we're here last week of the
year, closing things out for 2023.
I'm joined this week by lead partner John Lodra.
His partner, Mike Preston, has the week off for the holidays.
John, thanks so much for joining us.
Hey, Adam.
Thank you very much for having me again.
Michael is on vacation, as you mentioned.
It's a great time of year that hopefully folks can spend time with their family and downshift
a little bit.
I really, really enjoyed Jim Rogers' comments always.
I appreciate most his self-deprecation and levity and humor that he injects into a really,
in his words, a concerning big picture.
We share those big picture concerns, but these are tectonic shifts that can move slowly and
oftentimes in confusing and head shifting ways in the opposite direction than what should
happen.
We've seen that play out in many ways over the last year.
Jim talks about the possibility of seeing at some point the worst bear market of his
lifetime.
There are plenty of good data points where that very well may come to pass.
As benign as that the market may seem right now that there are things in valuations and
other, you look at where debt is, there's plenty of things we can point to that could
be the fuel.
That's obviously something that keeps us awake and aware, but not stalled or stuck in our
boots here.
We're going to let the market tell us where things are in the short term, but we need
to be cognizant of the big picture.
But I appreciate Jim's, he's worried, but not short the market.
We were not short the market.
We think it's a very dangerous market to be short, but we do emphasize safety and stability.
We're holding lots of short term treasury bills and cash, just like Jim Rogers is.
And we think that's a good place to be with a good solid ballast of client portfolios.
But yeah, that's my big takeaway from Jim's comments.
Okay.
Yeah.
Jim, always a fun guy to listen to.
One of the things I took away that I believe I mentioned is I'm seeing a greater variety
of opinions as to where things are going to head in 2024, certainly that we saw going
into 2023.
You know, going into 2023, it seemed like almost everybody was singing from the same
song sheet that a recession was about to happen.
It was going to be another really rocky year.
Of course, just about everybody got surprised.
We've talked a lot recently about why.
I think a lot of the sort of stealth liquidity might be an important element and all of that.
But one of the things I'm seeing right now is there are, there are people out there who
are still very pessimistic about where things are headed.
Some that I think it's going to be more sort of, you know, rocky give and take.
There's going to be some good, there's going to be some bad, a good active investor should
be able to make some good money.
And then there's folks that are saying, hey, you know, the dashboard looks pretty green.
And this isn't true universally.
But one of the things I'm kind of noticing is, is it's the younger data-driven crowd
who really like just totally operates by their, their Vulcan models, right?
That just say, hey, we've got a proprietary trading model system and I just do what the
model tells me to do.
And that thing's really blinking green.
And of course that's still a relatively short term outlook.
You know, in most cases it's looking out one, two, three months.
And those folks are saying, hey, you know, feeling pretty optimistic about the chance
to make money in the near term here.
And it's sort of the older crowd.
It's the guys that have been around a lot of different market cycles that still tend
to be pretty darn pessimistic who have said, look, I've seen this movie enough times over
to see a lot of similarities here and whether we're talking to Felix Zulauf or David Rosenberg
or Ted Oakley, Fred Hickey, Mark Faber or Jim Rogers, you know, those guys are just
saying, oh, you know, I, I just, I, I, I've seen enough of this in the past that I did
not feel like we've somehow magically skated through, you know, these past couple of years
and all their deformities with, with no real big reckoning.
So it's going to be really interesting to see what comes in the future from here.
And of course, both could be right.
We could have a really big, you know, time in the markets in the short term here.
And then we could have some sort of event or series of events that, that turns things
around as the year progresses.
Who knows?
We'll see.
But it was sort of interesting to note that it's that, that differential between the young
bucks and the seasoned old guys out there.
All right.
Well, look I know that you prepared a couple of slides, John, and we don't need to dive
into them immediately for you if you don't want to, but some of them are somewhat germane
to what's going on here.
But again, as I mentioned, this is the last video of the year.
And so you know, kind of wrapping up, looking at how we did this year kind of an interesting
year because it was, it was such a positive year for so many assets.
But if you take a two year view, it tells a really different story, right?
Yeah.
Well, Adam, and I have to thank you for not throwing my name or even your name or Mike
Preston's name in the mix of old season folks.
We actually feel like we're perhaps beyond our years.
We're in our early fifties and I know you are as well.
But look, we've, we've managed, we've lived through the last two major bubbles.
We've managed client assets through the last two major bubbles, and I'm not even talking
about the COVID bubble.
I'm talking about the housing and tech bubble, but we have become, we've lived decades through
the study of market history.
So I would, I would lump ourselves in, in that that seasoned crew certainly from a perspective
of data.
And that was, I think the real important thing is you know, there are a lot of different
systems out there.
Everybody wants to kind of the, the, the magical indicator, you know the, the single indicator
that is a light switch on and off to tell you when to get in and out.
I am going to be the first of many folks that would say that doesn't exist.
If you think it exists, you're, you're fooling yourself.
And in fact, you may find that one that, that works and then suddenly doesn't.
And the markets are going to be very abusive to that kind of approach.
Our approach, you know, certainly we're very valuation aware.
We think ultimately valuations dictate where asset prices go and returns that are likely
to be see over sale at the next five, seven, 10 years.
And those are the kinds of timeframes that matter most, I would say for, for the kinds
of people we serve, our clients who are real people that their, their money is not about
making a headline in the newspaper, but paying for their lifestyle and creating the retirement
security they want and need.
So but our approach is, is valuation aware, but we also have, you know, weight of the
evidence.
We, we follow a bunch of technical dashboards and I would say rather than a single magical
indicator, be it liquidity or moving averages or whatever.
We have a, a composite, an ensemble of, of many different indicators and it's the moving
in concert.
And I like to use the imagery of a, of a jigsaw puzzle.
One need not have a complete picture to have a, a really good informed view on what the
picture likely looks like.
And there's always going to be some ambiguity, some, some uncertainty.
That's the nature of, of what investing is all about.
You're never going to have perfect information.
And anybody thinks about binary outcomes, I think is fooling themselves.
We think about things in terms of probabilities and the weights of those probabilities, but
to your point about you know, kind of the, maybe the disparate takes of the younger data,
data folks and the more seasoned folks, I, I, I liken it to you can kind of have your
cake and eat it too, but you got to keep things in perspective.
So for example, as bullish as we have talked about our indicators flashing in recent weeks
and months, we think there is, it's foolish to say, for example, put a hundred percent
of one's portfolio in adherence to those indicators because we are in still a very, very viciously
overvalued market.
So we're about, we're in the low 40% allocation to stocks right now.
We do have hedges on a bunch of those stocks, but we're more bullish and, or, you know,
we're more allocated to stocks right now, for example, than we were earlier and in 2023
one might say we got the timing wrong and that would be correct in an absolute way,
but we're following our system, right?
We're following our discipline and the golden rule of success is, is having a discipline
system.
And it's not about being perfect.
We're, we're far from perfect.
And it's all about here and now looking forward, not the rear view mirror.
And you alluded to, for example you know, the, the last couple of years, I think it's
really important because we've just crossed the milestone with the, with the market strength
this year, especially over the last six weeks or six, seven weeks.
We have on a total return basis exceeded in the S and P 500, for example, the prior peak
of January 3rd of 2022, I got a chart I want to show you there, but let's, let's, let's
jump to that actually.
But this is a chart showing for broad for major market assets what the returns total
return has been, including dividends from the January 3rd, 2022 peak right through yesterday.
I know this, this will air on a New Year's Eve day, I believe, but this, this data, this
recording today is on December 27th.
So you look here, some interesting things come out.
So first of all, over that period gold has been one of the best performance, almost 14%
total return over that nearly two year period, the mag seven, the seven stocks that we've
talked about ad nauseum, you know, are up about 12% over that timeframe.
Now they're up huge this year, but the reason they're only up to only up 12% this year is
they were down over 40% at the end of last year for 2022.
Here's a shock.
Sorry to interrupt, but that, that is, that is interesting given how much tape has been
spilled this year and how phenomenally well those seven stocks did do.
And they did amazingly well.
They had been knocked down so hard the year before that they're only up barely in the
double digits over this two year period.
Yup.
Yeah, absolutely.
Here's a shocker cash one a month, one to three month treasury bills up 6.65% cumulative
over that timeframe, third best on this dashboard of assets that I've got here, the S&P 500,
you know, the whole the cap capitalization weighted S&P 500, 2.74% only over the last
couple of years since, since January 3rd, trailing cash handsomely, and of course much
more volatile than cash.
The equal weighted S&P 500 up a half a percent 60, 40 benchmark, which is maybe the industry
standard for folks that are in or near their retirement years, a 60% stocks, 40% bonds
down negative over, over, over negative 1% loss, the total aggregate return aggregate
bond index down, you know, seven, almost 8% small caps, small mid caps, Russell 2000 down
almost 7% long-term treasury still even after a massive bounce over the last you know, month
and a half plus still down almost 28% since, since last year.
So as much as we'd love to talk about calendar years and look at calendar years as performance,
one year does not make a retirement security.
It's the tapestry of the years.
And just as important as the return is the volatility of the returns and the mag sevens
are probably a perfect case in point.
The bigger loss that you are drawn on that one, one has on their portfolio or an asset,
the bigger, the miraculous recovery is needed even just to get back to even.
So you know, we're, we're happy to have, have not, we certainly have gotten, got, not gotten
everything right.
These last couple of years, we've made plenty of misjudgments, including being in the camp
that probably saw a, a, a much more high likelihood of recession, recession kicking in earlier
this year that didn't come to pass call us, call us in that camp.
We, we erred on that but we still did pretty good.
And and you know, we, we've navigated the last couple of years, I think as, as well
as we could have without ignoring what still is a nasty, nasty macro picture, neverminding
the next few months as, as to what that might hold.
All right.
Well, let's, let's actually go onto your next slide there because of course the chart you
just showed is very reflective of how the majority of the market has been very wrong
in the past two years, right?
At the end of 2021 market was hitting new all-time highs and there was a strong sense
of look, this is going to the moon, right?
Goldilocks forever, everything is awesome forever.
And then 2022 hit and investors were reminded that, oh my gosh, you know, portfolios can
take losses.
And then at the end of 2022, everybody was still, you know, incredibly sure that there
was a recession that was going to happen that didn't materialize.
And in fact, we actually had a really strong year in the markets.
So of course, a lot of people are scratching their heads right now saying, well, does that
mean that folks are going to be surprised going into 2024?
Because again, animal spirits are running wild now, especially in the wake of this federal
reserve kind of given the green light to the markets.
And you know, it sort of begs the question, everybody is really optimistic for 2024.
And history has shown when the market has strong emotions at the end of the year, those
emotions tend to be exactly the wrong ones for how did the future year unfolds.
So I know we don't know what's going to happen next year, but I'm just curious your thoughts
on that.
Yeah.
So this chart that I think you just asked me to pull up, Adam, this price speaks to
that probably better than anything.
This is a poll done by Bloomberg opinion, not too long ago, early December.
And it's a poll of economists and their expectations for, you know, what kind of landing slash
recession and a full nearly 50% are anticipating a quote unquote soft landing Goldilocks, right?
And only about a third are anticipating recession in the next 12 months.
That's pretty stark contrast to a year ago when it was something like 85% of economists
were expecting recessions.
Now two things jump out of here, perhaps the folly of trying to make those predictions,
at least with precision of timing, but also I think, I mean, you just kind of touched
upon this.
I think when sentiment shifts so far in one view, that view is likely to be proven wrong.
And certainly it was last year this time when everybody was predicting recession.
And I might say there's pretty good chance that this kind of latest poll is going to
be in for a surprise.
No guarantees whatsoever, but we'll watch our indicators in the market and, you know,
the market is not a very good predictor of recessions.
In fact, the stock market typically is at its peak right before a recession.
So we're going to, you know, not let the market kind of blind us as to the bigger picture,
but a lot of pie in the face, egg in the face, and I think we'll see more.
The big, you know, the big, I think, news item today, Adam, is the standoff that the
market and the Federal Reserve is having in regards to interest rate expectations for
the year ahead.
Last Fed meeting, Jerome Powell communicated a dovish tilt on behalf of the Fed that basically
acknowledged, hey, we're thinking that there might be some rate cuts next year, even though
two weeks earlier they were saying, we're not even thinking about, talking about having
rate cuts, right?
They, you know, it was pretty, pretty in about shift.
But the communication at that time was, hey, you know, we think maybe up to three cuts,
maybe we'll see the effective federal funds rate go from 5.3-ish area to 4.6 by the end
of 2024.
And what the market did with that, they put that in their, put that bit in their teeth
and you know, it took a mile when the Fed was only given an inch.
The market is priced in six to six and a half, maybe seven rate cuts at one point.
And I'll show you a chart here in a second, just what the market implication is or what
the market's implying.
All right, so this is from the CME Fed Watch.
I'll just give you a quick tour of what this, so right now the current target federal fund
rate is between five and a quarter, five and a half, that's right here, 525, 550.
Here are the meeting dates for the Federal Reserve next year.
So the market's pricing in about a 16 and a half percent probability.
The Fed will drop a quarter basis point at the January meeting.
Let's jump away out to the July meeting, essentially zero probability the market is assuming the
Fed will have kept at the current rate and in fact that zero probability that they'll
even be a quarter point lower than here.
In fact, most of the probability by 80% right here has the rate at four and a half or lower
and a not insignificant amount down to 4%.
That's already, even just by mid year, vastly outpacing the Fed's own communication in terms
of the level of rate decreases we might see next year.
And if you go out to December, I mean, geez, look at the bulk of the probability is 4%
or lower.
So the market has way front run the Fed here in terms of rate policy.
I think it probably portends for a brutal bloodbath in one way or the other.
Maybe the Fed does drop rates like the market expects, but if history is any guide, that
will likely be because it's simultaneous with a nasty, nasty market sell off and probably
a very significant economic slowdown, which doesn't bode well for things like the stock
market as bullish as things might seem in the very near term.
But there's also, I think, a very good chance that the market's got this wrong and the Fed
doesn't meet its expectations of rate drops and for the same reason we might see assets
sell off for that because inflation might be tempted to rear its head again.
I think we're in for a kind of a binary show here eventually, one way or the other.
And this, I think, is probably the best illustration of where the market is at odds with certainly
what the Fed is looking at.
Yeah.
And I got to tell you, John, this is where I'm particularly flummoxed by the Fed because
the market taking a mile when the Fed gave it an inch has been the story for the past
year plus.
Right?
And the Fed has met every time and said, look, we're going to be higher for longer.
And the markets would say, we don't believe you.
And the market would play chicken with the Fed.
And all along the way, the market has had to back off and realize, oh, you know what?
I guess Powell actually meant it.
And the market has had to readjust and readjust or readjust, but it hasn't mattered.
In other words, asset prices kept grinding higher all year.
And to a certain extent, that was frustrating to the Fed, right, because the higher the
market would go, the looser financial conditions would become, right, which was contrary to
what the Fed was trying to do with its hiking and tightening.
So I just don't know why Powell went and basically just unlocked every cage at the animal spirits
zoo in this last one.
He's reaping, I think, exactly what he should have known he was selling by doing that.
And now to your point, we have this massive gap chasm in expectations between what I think
the Fed wants the world to expect and what the markets want here.
And yeah, you know, either somehow miraculously, the track record keeps continuing where the
market takes a mile and it doesn't matter and asset prices can catch up to that.
I have a hard time like rationalizing that script short of just continued rising net
liquidity like we've been talking about with Michael Howell and Simon White and some of
the recent folks here, which could definitely play a role.
I think it probably will.
But a six to seven rate cut expectation next year is a pretty massive one.
And so I agree with you, John, that either the market's going to have to be disappointed
and walk back some of this exuberance or it's going to get what it's expecting, but not
for the reasons it's expecting it, like you said, and that we have a real crisis that
requires that type of scramble by the Fed.
And that's definitely not going to be asset asset friendly.
So who knows?
You know, it's going to be an interesting year.
Certainly say it for that much.
Yeah.
Adam, you know, I want to make a couple of comments on liquidity because there's been
a lot of debate, a lot of good, you know, discussion about that with Michael Howell's
interview that you did last week and Simon White, which I thought was a great interview.
I listened to a good part of that on my commute to work and encourage your viewers to take
a listen to that if they haven't already.
One kind of point I want to kind of throw out there for consideration is this idea when
we talk about liquidity, whether it's simple measures or more convoluted measures like
Michael Howell's balance sheet capacity, I think most casual listeners have this notion
that there's this kind of cash on the sidelines, this pile of money flowing into markets.
And that's why they go higher.
And I really want to caution people to really understand what's going on here because there
is no such thing as cash on the sidelines.
When cash comes off the sidelines and buys stocks, for example, well, the prior holders
of those stocks now are holding that cash.
The sum total of cash and stocks and bonds in the system is a zero sum game.
It's just a matter of who's holding them.
So what I would agree is that liquidity on many different measures probably resorts the
urgency by which different types of investors want to be in a certain asset class versus
be out of.
So you bet you when liquidity is causing folks to flow into stocks, there's equal amount
of folks flowing out of stocks.
And I can't help but be cynical here when we are at record high valuations that have
rarely ever been seen.
The notion of a bag holder comes to my mind.
Someone's holding the bag when this thing turns, and usually it's the most unsuspecting.
So I just want to caution folks.
It's very important to understand liquidity and how it motivates desire and urgency and
maybe fear of missing out and that kind of thing.
But it's not this visual of this pile of cash suddenly needing to find a home.
It's home, and it's always going to be home where it is, just a matter of who's holding
it in which form.
And that's a really important point that I think everyday people have to understand.
Yeah, and I think one of the things that's hard for liquidity, at least admitting it
for myself, is it's sort of nebulous to measure.
You talk to guys like Michael Howell, and he's got his own proprietary way of measuring
it, and Simon's got his own charts, and Lance Roberts's firm has their own charts.
And it's somewhat opaque too.
It's not like the stock market where we can just see the flows much more cleanly day in
and day out.
And so the danger is to invest in it sort of like on faith, like, oh, OK, I'm making
basically a bet that liquidity is going to keep rising through period X, Y, or Z, something
you have no control over.
It's something you can't really track that much.
And to your point, John, it might even work.
It might even be an indicator that's positively correlated, but not always.
And so if you're going to bet on it, it's not something you should be betting the vast
majority of your wealth on because it's something that's hard to perceive.
We all don't really understand it.
Everybody calculates it differently, and the correlation may not be consistent.
So just be cautious of listening to one video and saying, OK, well, this is the one way
I'm going to invest going forward.
That said, I do think it's highly explainative and has been very influential.
So I don't want to discount it as well, but I just want to caution people from putting
too many eggs in that one basket.
All right, John.
Well, look, we're beginning to approach the end here.
Like I said, you're the last guest for the year.
And what a year it's been.
And I want to thank you again and Mike and the team at Dew Harbor and everybody watching
and our other partners as well for kind of going on my journey this year, which has ended
up here now at Thoughtful Money.
And I think it's ended at a really great place.
I'm super excited about what's coming in the future from here, but as we're sort of wrapping
up this year and looking backwards and being a little pensive, I have been asking a lot
of my recent guests, John, in addition to these money related investment recommendations
that folks make on this channel every week, what are some of their non-financial, non-money
related investments they encourage folks to adopt?
So I want to give you the chance to be able to chime in on that before we turn into a
new calendar year.
Adam, I think that's such a fabulous little tangent you've entered into your interviews
because we're people.
I can tell you what we do here at New Harbor.
We love markets.
Sometimes we hate markets.
A lot of times lately we've been hating markets, but it's fascinating.
But it's really the people that we serve and the people and the sacrifice that people make
to save and do good for themselves.
That's what really makes this special.
There's a quote that I came across many years ago that I think says a lot.
The quote is this, "A rich life is--" or let me back up, "The most valuable asset is time,
not money, and a rich life is about spending that time well."
I think that quote says a ton.
Obviously what we talk about here is money, but I think one of the most important investments
someone can make is choosing how to invest their time.
I know others have talked about the importance of investing time in oneself, improving oneself,
taking care of oneself from a physical, spiritual, and emotional health type standpoint.
That's absolutely critical.
We all know that time is a strange thing.
We don't know how much we have.
We oftentimes will have far less than we realize.
Even those that do are blessed with longevity make the, I think, regretful mistake and oftentimes
too late to realize it until it's too late of spending that time unwell in the wrong
ways.
I think about time as something to give is to receive.
I think it's really healthy for folks to be thinking about investing time in ways that
can give to others.
Parents can think about investing time in their children, not in an indulgent way, but
in a caring and loving way and nurturing way.
People who have sick parents, I know you've just dealt with this, Adam, and I'm dealing
with it.
There's not a day that goes by where I wish I could spend more time with my mom who's
ill.
Time is this thing that evaporates, but think about this time of year.
This is going to be airing on New Year's Eve day.
Folks can give money to charities that you have until the end of New Year's Eve to make
a charitable donation and have it count for 2023, but I can tell you most local charities,
as much as they need money, they need your time.
They need you to invest your time in your community in a cause that you care about.
That's really what I would like to emphasize, just the important asset of time.
It's probably the most important asset we all have.
Money is important, but it's nothing if we don't take care of the time that we're granted
and gifted in this world.
I totally agree.
Very well said.
It's a good reminder at this time of year where most folks have a little bit of break
from work and actually have the capacity to spend a bit more time with those in their
lives.
Make the most of this while you have it.
I've been actually feeling that because I've been laid pretty low by this stupid cold and
my girls have been home for the first time, it's been a while since they've both been
home together, and I've barely been able to spend time with them because I've been basically
unconscious trying to sleep this thing off, so I've been acutely cognizant of the valuable
time that I'm not getting to spend with them, and hopefully, now that I'm near the tail
end of this thing, I can do more of that before life intervenes again.
One other thing you mentioned, just to be super tactical about it, yes, we very much
want to spend time with those who we may not have a lot of time left with like you mentioned
your mother there, John, and you absolutely should.
Now going through this on my father's side, one thing that I think if you're older, think
about ... I hate to be this practical, but think about estate planning because there's
steps that you can take now, either communicating things, putting things in writing, working
with a lawyer, getting things lined up, where you can save so much time and uncertainty
for those that are going to survive you once you go because I know having done this now
twice recently, there's an awful lot of time where we've just spent trying to guess what
should be done because the parent whose property this is or relationship this was or whatever,
they've never communicated what they wanted done, and a lot of time tracking down documents
or conversations with all the people in their lives trying to gerry piece back together
what might have been their desire here.
Use the time you have to not only spend lots of time together and make new memories, also
use the time you have to try to save a lot of future wasted time for those in your life.
You're nodding as I'm saying this.
>> Yeah, that's one of the hardest conversations to have with oneself, never mind one's family,
your own mortality and planning, but I can tell you the clients we help have that oftentimes
it turns into a surprisingly healthy and endearing and warm conversation between them and their
loved ones.
Rather than something that they both dread, it becomes a source of bonding and celebration
of the life that they currently have, and it almost brings into a picture of one's ultimate
passing as being a joyful event, not as somber event as it needs to be.
Because things have been talked about about legacy and what the meaning of life is and
this and that, and it's less about the assets but more about the tapestry of my life.
>> Yeah, and I hate to be grim on this and maybe that's just the theme of this year with
so much loss in it, but sort of passing the torch and talking about transitions from general
generations.
Yes, for those of us in the sandwich generation dealing with our parents, there's a lot of
practical needs that have to happen there and it can be awkward, but it can be great
in some of the ways you're talking about.
But it's also an opportunity for us to pull up the younger generations into that discussion
so that they sort of see the cycle of life and then, "Okay, my parents are in the thick
of this one right now, but I'm going to have to step into that future."
And it's a way for them to kind of understand their grandparents and their elders a little
bit more before they end up passing away and they feel more, I think, invested in the ongoing
family legacy that lives beyond anyone, just single generation.
So it's just something to think about.
One last morbid thing on this and I promise I'll end on a happier note, but you see this
a lot, John, I think with your clientele is sometimes we lose people before they're actually
physically gone, right, where we have so many seniors who are living now to longer ages
where it's something like dementia or Alzheimer's that kicks in, right?
And so again, it's this sort of planning that we're talking about, these communications
and whatnot while everybody's still there and of sound mind and whatever, super important
to have them because sometimes the person you know may actually leave before the body
you know does and so anyways, again, just because we've had conversations in the past,
John, about this, getting all the things lined up in place, power of attorneys and all that
type of stuff, very important, all right.
But enough of that.
Very true.
And Adam, the great part, you have those conversations, then the conversation turns to what you want
your party to look like when you die.
We've had clients say, "I want live jazz and lots of shrimp."
It can be a really fun discussion.
It doesn't have to be a completely morbid discussion.
All right.
Right.
Well, okay.
And again, too, this is also the time of year, too, where planning for next year, you get
to talk about the fun things like birthdays and weddings and all that type of stuff and
new life coming in and whatnot.
So anyways, folks, however you're spending your holidays, I hope you all had great Christmases
or Hanukkahs or Kwanzas or Festivuses or whatever you guys celebrate.
But to John's point about spending time with people and really making the best use of our
time, it's a great time of year to be looking at the full calendar going forward next year
and just placing those tent poles in the ground and saying, "Hey, I'm going to do my best
to try to keep life from wrenching those away from me.
And what's time that I can commit to the calendar to spend with those people that I want to
spend my time most with and which memories do I want to create most next year?
And how do I protect and preserve my ability to have those now?"
So anyways, hopefully that's the way that we're all ending the year here.
As we wrap up, and sorry, John, real quick, just wanted to also compliment you on your
thing about giving time.
A lot of times on this channel, we'll talk about investments and whatnot.
A lot of people be like, "Oh, that's great, but I don't have as much money as maybe it
requires to make X investment or whatever."
But we can all give a bit of our time.
And especially when we're talking about locally and the ways that we can make difference,
like you said, sometimes even more than your dollars.
A lot of your local resource organizations want most people's engagement and their sweat
equity, basically to help make the change they want to make in that community.
So anybody can contribute to that.
All right, we'll look at wrapping up here.

What was that little blue icon right next to it, that blue bell icon right next to it?
And talking about subscribing, just a reminder for folks, my new sub stack, which I share
lots of information almost daily about the New Thoughtful Money movement, that's where
I've been republishing my Adam's Notes, which are my cliff notes summaries of the videos
that we do on this channel, including this one with Jim Roberts.
If you want to get those, just become a premium subscriber.
And if you're thinking about it, become a premium subscriber today, if you haven't already.
And the reason why is because the low price, it's only like eight bucks a month.
It's going to jump up at the beginning of January to $15 a month.
Still pretty cheap, but more than it is right now.
And if you subscribe before midnight here on New Year's Eve, you'll be able to get grandfathered
in at that low $8 a month price for as long as you remain subscribed.
So sub stack tells me if you stay subscribed for the next five or 10 years, your price
isn't going to change.
So if you're thinking about that, save yourself some money and move on it now.
And just in wrapping up here, John, I will let you have the last word.
Any parting bits of advice for folks as we head into the new year?
No, just enjoy yourself, enjoy the time that you have.
2024 is coming.
It's going to be an interesting year.
Just very much look forward to our continued discussions, Adam.
You're doing a fabulous job here with your new channel, and we look forward to great
things to come for you here, and we're happy to be a small part of that with you.
All right, great, John.
Well, thanks so much.
Maybe early in the new year, we can have some time in one of these videos just dedicated
to kind of kicking around for folks some of the ideas of what we plan to do in 2024.
For thoughtful money, I think folks will enjoy some of the vision that we have for how we're
going to continue to grow this movement here.
But in the interim, while they wait, folks, if you are not completely done yet on listening
to content in 2023, if you haven't watched it yet, watch the interview that I just released
two days ago with Kevin Muir of The Macro Tourist.
I'll put a link to it right here.
That'll be a really good way to close out the year.
John, my friend, thanks so much for all your partnership this year.
Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
