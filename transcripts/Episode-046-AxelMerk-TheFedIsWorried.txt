Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. Thanks for joining me for this live event here.
We're here with Fed watcher Axel Merck. He is the founder and chief investment officer for the Merck family of funds. A few months ago, we had Axel on
right after that FOMC meeting release and Jerome Powell press conference, and it went so well, we thought we'd do it here again.
And just a reminder, folks watching here live, thank you. And you guys are premium subscribers to Thoughtful Money sub stack. Thank you for that.
Watching live and being able to ask questions is one of the perks of being a premium subscriber. Everybody else will be watching this on replay a few days later.
Anyways, Axel, thank you so much for joining us. Well, let's just dive right in here. What did you take away from Powell's -- well, I guess from the general
Fed release, they made more red line changes than they have in previous ones.
A lot, yeah.
And then Powell obviously filled a lot of questions. So what did you take away from yesterday's actions?
Yeah, so I think the way I started last time is saying, oh my God, you call me a Fed watcher when I'm a money manager.
But you watch the Fed very closely.
I watch the Fed very closely. And the context, though, is relevant, right?
And economists is happy to predict the economic growth to the second decimal point. I could care less about the second decimal point.
What I care about is that the folks who have the sledgehammer and control the rate of what is considered to be risk-free money and influences everything and anything we do in the investment world.
And as such, as an investor, we are slaves of central banks and we have to deal with them.
And so it's in that context that I watch them.
Right. You have to be, if the bully on the block has a bazooka, whether you like him or not, you've got to pay attention to what he does.
Exactly. And I just mentioned that you framed the discussion because that's, it's relevant because that affects where interest rates are.
That affects where interest rates are not just short term, but what the market is pricing in long term.
And that has an impact on just about everything you buy in the store to the fancy derivatives you buy on your mobile phone these days.
So when you when you do your day trading.
And so when before Powell started, people said, oh, he's going to try to say as little as possible.
The one thing I think we want to take up front, what he said is he said pretty much straight out that they're talking about cutting rates.
Now, of course, he didn't say it straight out.
But what he did say is that when he was asked the question, did you discuss rate cuts and the quote unquote normal things in central banks around the world until recently as being no, no, we didn't even consider that.
So that the market wouldn't cut a price in for the rate cuts.
Whereas this time around, he said that they discussed it in the context of the economic projections.
Those are the so-called dot plots. And so, yes, they did discuss rate cuts.
And what he pretty much I mean, the short of it is he said, well, the economy is a bit better than than we had thought.
So, yes, we'll be cutting rates, but not quite yet. And so not quite yet in March.
And the market reacted accordingly. It priced in a tad less of a likelihood of a rate cut in March and a tad more of a likelihood in rate cuts than subsequently.
And then further out the curve, longer term rates, there was more of a rally that that more rate cuts or lower rates would be priced in longer term.
All right. And well, let's see here. So, you know, there were I think a couple of things, the markets. I mean, it's interesting.
They were down a lot after this thing. And then today they're they're just parting hard again on earnings releases from Amazon and Apple, I think, or Amazon and Facebook.
But Powell, you know, basically said, hey, you know, we are going to cut. We're still thinking about cutting, but we don't know when.
Right. And he said it's probably not going to be March. Right. And so I think that disappointed some part of the market.
And that they'll be making decisions meeting by meeting, going forward, and even left the door open to say, hey, look, if I have to reverse course and even go higher at some point, I will.
So it just felt a little less, you know, sort of party on Garth the way that the last Fed meeting seemed to be.
And again, markets corrected briefly for a millisecond.
Well, context matters, right? Let's let's just think about why they say what they say and why it matters to us.
As I've mentioned to you before on your wonderful program here is it would be lovely if the Federal Reserve actually had a formula that based on inflation and unemployment, this is what we would do.
But instead, they do this micromanagement of where rates may be, will be and what not.
And it's kind of like pornography. We're sort of like, well, we'll kind of know when we see it. Right.
We're confident, but we want to be more confident. Everybody asked him, well, what's it going to take for you to be more confident?
And he just was very wishful. Just more of the good data, but can't say exactly how much more.
I have to think about that pornography analogy, but you're probably right.
So a few months ago, Powell moved away from higher for longer and all but said mission accomplished, which means that we don't have to worry about inflation as much anymore.
By the way, in Europe, somebody came out today and said, well, maybe we should be worrying about inflation.
And I don't know whether you've followed the news in Europe, but there's a strike everywhere.
I mean, the truck, the track, the farm drivers with their tractors, they are blocking roads.
The railway is on strike and it's almost every country there that's going on right now.
Yeah. Yeah. But no inflation anymore. No more problems. But in any case, why would Powell have done that?
Well, there are two reasons. One is inflation has indeed been coming down.
But the other one is that maybe, maybe he is concerned about something.
And the one thing that's in the news today as we speak is, of course, commercial real estate.
That in three continents and the banks that have kind of said, hello, we got a little problem here.
And so the market may be paying more attention to it. And that is, of course, something that has been in the making.
You may recall nine months ago, we converted an acute into a chronic problem with the regional banks that have,
that both mismanaged interest rate risk and have significant commercial real estate exposure.
By the way, turning it from an acute into a chronic problem.
Yes. And what else is new, right? Banking is a, bank regulation and bank is a political question.
And so different countries have a different framework.
And in the US, we have this thing that we have a gazillion of regional banks because of in history,
the states required that the states were local in part to be hostage so that you couldn't go,
if your industry didn't do well, that you couldn't go somewhere else to provide lending that you have to lend to the locals.
But of course, that makes the banks also much more vulnerable because they don't have that diversification.
And so over the years, there's been a lot of consolidation and then the small banks are slowly dying.
And when you provide them a lifeline and we know that central banks can provide a lifeline to banks,
they'll be lending less. They can stick around. But once in a while, you have a little crisis playing up.
And of course, we haven't even talked about China, right, with the big liquidation happening there on a real estate portfolio.
One of the big companies have gone bust. And so that's the context here, right?
And then in the meantime, the headwinds to economic growth are increasing.
The effects of this higher for longer are going through the economy. But at the same time, this economy is stubbornly strong.
We're talking here before the nonfarm payroll report, the jobs report that's coming out on February 2nd.
And one of these days, one of these reports is going to be worse than expected.
But so far, they have been better than expected. And that kind of pushes out the rate cuts.
Although they are then generally adjusted downwards when the next release comes out.
Well, not only that, also the job market is the last one to hold up.
And so I'm still in the hot landing scenario camp, by the way.
And the reason is that at some point something will happen if it is only a little banking crisis that is coming back to haunt us.
And so if nothing else, Powell is aware that that might happen, right?
The baseline, the ideal scenario is, OK, this will be a little slow down. They can do everything fine.
But of course, the risk of a harder landing, of something going wrong, increases as time is going out.
And Powell is preparing the market for that.
And one of the reasons why the market may be pricing in these rate cuts that are quite significant is because we'll be maybe switching from higher for longer to lower for longer.
And the reason I say lower for longer is that inflation isn't the prime issue anymore.
The Fed can focus again on banks that haven't done their job all that well.
And they may need to throw them a lifeline, right, because this environment has been strangling them.
And they've been able to keep up a facade because they got this commercial real estate portfolio where they haven't had to do mark-to-market accounting.
But there's only a question of time when that has to happen.
And so that may be part of the reason why the market is pricing in lower rates as we move forward.
All right. So one of the things that kind of struck me yesterday was Nick Timmros, who is oftentimes called the mouthpiece of the Fed, is portrayed as a very friendly journalist to the Fed.
He kind of asked the pointed question of Powell where he said, "Hey, are you potentially taking too long here to start cutting?"
The Fed has a rap of always being behind the action. And Nick is, I think, basically questioning him, "Hey, you've kept rates high for really long.
Are those lag effects going to catch up with us if you don't start cutting sometime soon?"
Basically, Powell went on to say, "No, we don't think so," and gave all his reasons why.
But I did find it kind of interesting that the guy who's generally such a Fed cheerleader is kind of pointing here and saying, "Guys, are you going to basically make the same mistakes you always make?"
Well, we love to bash the Fed, and through that, I suppose many also bash Nick. He actually often asks very pointed questions. I don't agree with everything that he writes, but he is good.
He is good in his analysis of what the Fed does, so it's definitely worth following him, especially since he is influential and some say that he is used as an avenue for the Fed to communicate.
But he is, of course, right on this issue. There is higher for longer. There is going to be a lag effect, and until recently, the Fed was in hostage of the 1970s because they busted through inflation.
So now the worst that could happen is that the lower rates, when inflation is still there, and one of the things I've said, I still mean it, inflation tends to be volatile after it has been high.
There's no guarantee that the inflation is going to be low, but at the same time, we've had this mission accomplished speech by Powell, which means they say it's not an issue anymore.
So then the lag effects are the issue, and I come back to what I said. If the Feds were rules-based, if they didn't have a committee, a committee is by definition late to doing things.
They are fast when there's a true emergency, when everything is on fire. Yes, they can put foam on the streets and provide liquidity, but other than that, they are late in hiking.
They are late in lowering rates, and that's part of the reason why almost always after these hiking cycles, you have a recession because the soft landing is just an illusion.
That doesn't mean it's not possible, but as an investor, what I think about is, just as I'm not an economist thinking about the second decimal point, I don't care about where the economy is going to be six months so much.
I care about the possibility of risks and scenarios where it might be, and then I think about have I taken those scenarios into account.
Similarly, six months from now, I'm not going to slap myself on the back and say, "Yeah, I was great forecasting it," because the market is forward-looking.
It's what's going to happen in six months from then. Ultimately, as an investor, I have to think about, am I comfortable where I am?
Yes, I can express a view as an investor because if I'm right, I may be awarded disproportionately, but it's more about risk management that if I'm wrong, can I afford to be wrong?
Of course, we're in an environment where you get rewarded for holding cash, and so you really have to put out your neck trying to be right when you could be getting a decent interest rate in cash.
I'm not giving investment advice here. I'm just providing food for thought.
I'm going to make one response to that and then ask one more question, and then, folks, I'm going to start taking your questions here from the audience.
Just know I'm coming to you all and keep asking questions. I've seen the first few come on in.
To your point there, Axel, yes, you get paid to sit in cash right now, and the prudent investor or the one that doesn't have a strong thesis can get paid just to sit in safety and wait to see more clarity.
That being said, the market seems to be back in the FOMO. The Fed's got our back. Everything is melting up all the time environment now, and to a certain extent,
our investors not taking your approach, which is to say, "Let me consider all the different types of probabilities that are here and make sure that if probability A or C or M happens,
I've got a strategy for that." It seems like more people are just getting back into the like, "Hey, Fed's got our back again. Just go along by the dips."
I don't know. I see us moving away from the type of prudence that you just described.
Well, first of all, I don't blame anybody for not having "my approach." I would just wish everybody had an approach, as long as you have a plan.
Even a mediocre plan is better than having no plan whatsoever, and so that's really how I like to look at it.
Beyond that, yesterday in the Wall Street Journal, there was an article about the million-dollar closet.
Apparently, there's an increasing number of people that spend literally a million bucks on their closets where they have their shoes at home and stuff like that,
including champagne bar tanning place and whatnot. That's the sort of thing that gets me worried more so than even seeing somebody having meme stocks.
If nothing else, it suggests to me that that's more of a sign of a market top than a market bottom. Now, that's it. Of course, right?
I mean, if you're in cash, you're going to miss out on the rally. The question is what's your investment goal?
Is your goal in life to beat the S&P 500? Is your goal in life to have money for retirement?
Is your goal in life that you don't lose any money that you have because you got to make that payment next month and you currently have the cash available?
But that sort of thing should drive your investment. I'm in the fortunate situation that I can afford to take certain risks.
And so I place the money where I think is prudent. But yes, I do have probably more cash than I have historically often had.
I've had more cash in the past, but I've also been much more fully invested than I am right now.
Okay, so not investment advice, but you are taking a cautious stance on a relative basis.
One last question from me, and then we'll take some of the questions the audience is submitting here in the chat.
Powell was asked, would a slide in employment cause the Fed to accelerate its timeline for rate cuts or some sort of easing intervention?
And Powell said, yeah. And what was kind of interesting about that is I think the direction from Powell over the past year and a half has been,
"Hey, I've got this dual mandate, but I'm kind of willing to sacrifice jobs for a bit because I feel like they're too frothy anyways,
and we've really got this big inflation problem." Jobs haven't done much over this whole period of time.
Uninflation stayed relatively low according to the official numbers, which we could have a protracted discussion over whether how much we
can really believe them or not. But it's one of the first times that I've heard Powell say, "Yeah, no, no, if that starts weakening,
then that actually is going to drive a policy shift for us." Now, I'm sure it probably bothers you that he didn't give any sort of specific
formula or whatever. It's just going to be like, "Oh, if we start feeling uneasy about it, however that's defined, then we might do that."
But did that catch your attention too?
Yes. Let me first clarify something, though, that said I don't leave the wrong impression. When I said I have some cash but not as much,
it doesn't mean I have all my money in the S&P 500. There have been some public filings, you can look them up, that I've been heavily buying
some things on the gold mining side and other things. So it doesn't mean I'm putting it into a traditional 60/40 portfolio.
As you know, I've also bought some forests and some other things. So I'm putting cash to work, but it's not necessarily in the traditional asset classes,
just to put that out there so that people don't think I'm chasing the S&P 500, which I'm not terribly inclined to do in the current environment.
But to your question, yes, that's what the mission accomplished speech was a prelude to. Until last October, Powell said,
"It's all about inflation. We have to be higher for longer." And now that is out of the window. Now we can focus on the jobs market.
And of course, as long as the jobs market is healthy, there's no urgency to cut rates. And indeed, one of the things I think I've said on your program
as well is that when the Fed starts cutting rates, they will tell us, "Oh, we're not really easing financial conditions.
The only reason why we are cutting rates is so that real interest rates don't go up because inflation has come down."
But also because inflation is suddenly not a problem anymore, according to Powell, and I'm putting a little bit of words into his mouth,
but then, yes, we can focus on unemployment. And so if unemployment were to rise, we can lower rates.
Now, keep in mind, of course, there is a lag effect, and it might be too late, going back to your comment about Nick here from The Wall Street Journal.
But yes, unemployment has moved to the forefront, and that's 2024 for you, I suppose.
Okay. All right. Well, look, I want to start pulling some questions here from the audience. Let's see here.
"NYU grad, who is a very active younger substacker, very much appreciate this guy's focus, work ethic, and moxie,
is asking this question, where the news has been rife recently with the troubles at New York Community Bank,
down 50% in the past 48 hours. He notes that nobody really had the courage to bring this up to Powell.
But how concerning of a development is this to you? Is this a sign that maybe round two of the banking crisis might be underway,
or beginning to get started here? Of course, we have the expiry of the BFTP coming up here, or BTFP coming up here soon.
So wondering, too, on that, does that create any concerns for you that that safety net is about to be removed?"
So safety net, that's yet another topic. We got time.
Yeah. All right. So first of all, I'm not going to make a specific comment about that specific institution.
So anything I say, you can think about abstractly and then apply it as you wish, just because I'm not allowed to talk about a specific company.
But the context is, of course, and we talked briefly about it, the Federal Reserve converting an acute into a chronic problem.
Just to remind everybody, small banks have not been particularly good at managing interest rate risk, in part, by the way,
I think because they're overburdened with regulations. So they have crossed the T's on the regulations and missed the forest from the trees.
And then, of course, heavy exposure to commercial real estate. Everybody knows the problems with higher rates, greater vacancies.
Not a good recipe. But what the Federal Reserve allowed them to do is to pretty much ignore that the day of reckoning and live happily ever after.
Except, of course, there is no happily ever after. And what's happening gradually is that these property loans get renegotiated.
And they want to live for another day. And even sometimes when there's a default and the property owner hands the key over to the bank,
the bank gives the key right back and says, listen, we're not in the building management business. You guys are much better at doing that.
So it's this kind of symbiosis where nobody wants to face reality.
But then at some point, once in a while, they're going to say, well, maybe this property is actually worth much less than it is,
than we have it on the books. And that can create a cascade of issues. Part of it, how the regulation works, that suddenly and some New York banks,
and again, I can't talk specifically, exceed the threshold to be in a tighter regulatory environment.
And so, yes, that happened to New York community banks. But without them specifically.
And that then exacerbates the sort of pressure to get your house in order.
And I wouldn't be surprised if also at the Federal Reserve, that's slowly tightening the screws saying, listen, guys, you've had several months.
You've got to get the act together. But yes, this is a reminder that these issues are not over.
And it's not just in the U.S. In Switzerland, there's a bank. There was a big bankruptcy in Austria.
They had provided a huge loan and there's a huge write off. And so we'll see those sort of things happening.
And of course, that's not good for confidence. The question ultimately is, does it matter?
Obviously, it matters to the banks that are involved. But how systemic is the potential risk?
What sort of jitters are there? And last March, April, when it was, the Federal Reserve kind of said, OK, we apply a band-aid.
Don't you worry about it. And now, sure enough, as the reckoning is becoming more earnest in some of these things, there will be flare ups.
The question is, will that impact the broader market? Will that impact the Federal Reserve more broadly?
And ultimately, they don't know either. But they're ready to lower rates or provide liquidity or come up with some sort of scheme if indeed the market does react to it.
Just one more thing. Sorry for rambling on here. In the 1980s, we had the savings and loan crisis and it took years, eight, nine years plus to resolve those sort of things.
And by the way, one of the things that the institutions and the savings and loan crisis that were hit the worst that were at these tailor-made loan agreements.
And of course, that's what commercial real estate is, that it's very difficult to trade those loans that you have, their custom agreements.
And so all of that makes these sort of things much more difficult to resolve and, yes, can lead to liquidity events and not the good type.
So on the banking system and whether or not that there may be some flare ups or something even worse, they've had a year.
So do you suspect that there's some new version or several versions of different emergency actions that they've concocted in the past year
that just in case they need them, they can pull off the shelf? Or do you think it'll be a scramble like it was last time where everybody had to just figure it out on the fly?
Many people don't like it when I make these comparisons to savings and loan crisis, but there's a reason. I don't expect this to be over anytime soon.
I would think this thing drags on for years, because politically, it's not attractive to fix this issue. And so you push the can down the road
and policymakers are very good can kickers. That's one thing they're really, really good at.
Okay, and I'm just gonna mention this because you were asked this because you mentioned it. So we live out in the San Francisco Bay Area, both you and I do,
and the largest hotel in San Francisco, the Hilton Financial District, basically defaulted and mailed the keys back to its lender, like you were saying earlier.
How concerned are you about the cascade that failing commercial real estate could potentially set off here?
I mean, we're already seeing some casualties of it, but are we just in the early innings? Or maybe things are better than we thought?
Two things. First of all, those buildings will stick around, right? There is going to be at some point, and some of the debt is going to be wiped out.
And so then the question is, who owns the debt? And is it the levered institution that owns that debt? There was a story out a few days ago that
there were some hedge funds in Europe that have leverage of 2,000 to 1 in mortgage sort of trading strategies. And somehow people are saying, well,
maybe that's not a good thing for financial stability, right? And so if you have that with leverage, if you spread the risk to the masses,
then the losses are socialized, right? From a Federal Reserve point of view, it doesn't have much of an impact.
Of course, what happens on the commercial real estate side is these loans are sitting on balance sheets of regional banks. And does it matter?
At the very least, what matters is that if you're a zombie bank, if you are somehow impaired by whatever reason, you are less likely to extend credit.
I mean, that's the least of which that's going to happen. And then the question is, is somebody else going to jump in?
And what I've argued that the big banks are not equipped to service the same customers, but we have a lot of growth in the private credit side.
And I don't think they can serve small business well, but they could well step in on real estate lending.
And so there may be something. But of course, you have other items like pension funds probably have exposure and whatnot.
So there are other things. And of course, we haven't talked about China much. There it's hopeless and liquidators of these things cannot find anybody to buy this stuff because the distortions are just so huge.
And so to me, the bigger question is, is something going to blow up there? Back here, the Federal Reserve has shown so creative ever since the financial crisis that if they don't want an institution to fail, they can patch it up.
The question is always, what's the side effect? And by the way, aside from the ripple effects that happen when zombie institutions are staying alive, there's a political fallout.
I think the big reason why we have this political polarization is that those people say that system is rigged.
This is not capitalism. And they are going to go after the whatever, the one percenters or the bad bankers or these or that and blame whoever you want.
And you can't blame them. Right. And so the polarization we have in politics, I think, is in part due to financial policies that are misguided.
So it's more than just a bank potentially blowing up.
Oh, God. All right. You've just mentioned several things. First off, I just want to show this question from Greg Rabin, because I think we've actually just largely answered this.
But I want to give a nod to Greg that we did see it come on in. All right, Axel, since you mentioned China, I just got to ask you at least very quickly.
What's your level of concern of contagion coming from there? I mean, China's suddenly in a lot worse. I mean, China was reopening, right, coming 2022 into 2023.
Everybody said, all right, that's going to be driving global growth again. I think a pretty big disappointment from what the expectations were back then.
I mean, hitting here in 2024, China's woes just seem to be mounting by the week.
Well, what I can say is that in China, when they want to stimulate the economy, and they pump money into the economy, it tends to drive up risk assets in the rest of the world.
And so equities in the US tend to do better when the Chinese are printing money. And printing money may not be exactly the right term, but they have such a micromanaged economy
that it's very difficult to predict what exactly it's going to do. But on a bigger scale of things, right, are they able to stomach the tide?
And if you look at the economic data, they seem to. Now, can you believe those economic data? There's, of course, a lot of work going on about how much energy are they using, how much this are they doing, and so forth.
To me, it's a concern. But it's like many of these things, right? They're not a concern until they are.
And one thing we know, if that concern comes to fruition, central banks are going to take out the firehouses to counter it.
There is, of course, more shielding of the US economy in particular to what's happening in China. And so that part is all right, but it can well impact economic growth. That it can do.
Okay. And then you were sort of talking about what the Fed's able to control, what it's not able to control. I just had a long discussion this morning with Sven Henrich.
And that video will have aired prior to this one to the masses. And spent a long time kind of railing against the just massive amount of fiscal spending that's going on right now.
And to a certain extent, it has overpowered a lot of the Fed's tightening. And I just want to get your thoughts on this push-pull that we've seen or this opposition of forces
between all the hiking that the Fed has done, QT that it's underwent, yet the liquidity that we've had pumped into the system by the Treasury, by the deficit spending.
I know there are other factors that can influence liquidity, too, but certainly we've had a rising net liquidity wave over the past year that largely has --
I mean, certainly financial conditions are a lot looser than they were a year ago. So is this all part of a grand plan? Is this just a soup of people doing things
that they're not taking each other into account? Is this a good thing? Is it a bad thing? What are your thoughts on it?
Well, it matters medium term, right? I mean, first of all, yes, there's a stimulus in the system because of fiscal policy. Historically, politicians scramble
for a fiscal stimulus at the bottom of a recession, and then it comes out late when the recovery is well underway. This time around, we had the stimulus early.
And by the way, Trump showed the way on that. We had an okay economy, and there was a stimulus package introduced, and we had a gang-buster economy running into the pandemic.
And the Biden administration had a huge infrastructure spending in a decent economy, or recovering economy anyway, inducing inflation.
There's plenty of stimulus to lift. Some of it is abating, right? And so the question is, what's going to be the policy going forward?
Republicans talk about that we have a spending problem, but they don't exactly have a huge history on getting rid of spending either.
It's usually just always the other guys spent the money the wrong way. There's a lot more that could be due on the stimulus side where you don't need to spend money
because you can do it by cutting regulations. But yes, it made the Fed's job much harder. It's one of the reasons why unemployment is so low.
It's one of the reasons why we have hired for longer and why we haven't seen a hard landing yet. So it has a huge impact.
I still believe, though, that the lag effects of the Fed are going to ultimately outweigh it and bring this economy down.
And we do see jobless claims as we speak this morning were a little higher than expected. I mean, at some point it's going to happen.
But this is kind of the most forecast recession ever. And the relevance is that anybody who can prepare for it has prepared for it.
But there are plenty of companies that aren't ready for what's to come.
All right. Well, I'm glad you're on my island of believing that the lag effect is eventually going to matter because it's been a lonely island recently.
But let me ask you this question.
Gundlach, by the way, said it as well a few days ago.
Yes, yes. That's a great company to be in.
And then if he says it, it's got to be right. I mean, again, right?
Well, actually, who do you think owns the island? Good luck.
It's ultimately, again, not about being right or wrong. It's about the risk. And if that risk happens, are you prepared for that risk?
And the context is that in a soft landing, risk assets tend to do just fine and a hard landing not so much. Right.
And so that's why it matters. Now, if you can stomach even a severe downturn in the market, who cares?
But since you are watching this program, maybe you do care.
I think a lot of our people do fall into the do care bucket.
Last question on this that I asked Sven earlier today, which is now that excessive fiscal stimulus is now just sort of the dominant policy.
Right. That D.C. Capitol Hill has just turned it up to 11 in terms of like, yeah, let's just keep spending.
Right. We're time spending, even though we're in a peacetime economy.
And if you listen to Jerome Powell or Janet Yellen, the economy is doing fine. Right. Why do we need all this stimulus?
Now that it's just sort of business as usual, can they stop it? Right.
And I kind of liken this to the Affordable Health Care Act. Right. Which was a criticism of it was, hey,
you're going to give millions of people health care who didn't have it before, which, of course, everyone's going to cheer you for.
But if it turns out to be a bad idea, you'll never be able to politically walk that back.
You'll never be able to take that health care away from those people because it'll be such a politically unpopular decision.
So are we at a point right now where it would just be too prohibitively politically unpopular for somebody to say, OK, you know what?
Now we got to turn that spigot off. Now it's time for belt tightening. Now it's time for austerity.
I don't know anybody that's willing to go out and say that, especially in an election year, but just in general.
I mean, just take the example of Nikki Haley advocating that Social Security be reformed and is not getting any traction for that.
Right. There is talking about restraint is politically not popular and politicians have figured out that deficits don't matter.
And they don't until they do, of course. Right.
And so, yes, it means that and of course, that does place the seeds of inflation down the road.
Is that a problem today? Apparently, the markets don't think so. Is it a problem for tomorrow?
Almost certainly it is. It is not sustainable what we're spending.
And just look at the CBO projections, look at what Social Security Trust Fund does and whatnot.
Though that's not somehow hyperbole on anything. It's just the math doesn't make sense.
But politicians throughout the world have a tendency to only make the right decisions when the market coerces them to do it.
And that day is not today. Let's just put it this way.
Okay. All right. A few more questions here. We've got one here from Keith. Hey, Keith.
And he asks, UPS recently announced layoffs of 12,000 people in management.
We've actually seen a real pickup in layoffs across a lot of brands, a lot of the major brands here at the start of 2024.
He asks, is this a sign of a weakening jobs market that could lead to Fed easing or just Amazon's disruption?
So I guess you seeing anything in the layoff data here that has you concerned?
Because I think we've talked about in the past, Axel, I've talked about it with a lot of people on this channel, is employment does seem to be the linchpin between us and a hard landing, right?
Where if employment hangs in there, we should be okay. But if it starts going, bar the door.
So it's always company specific until it is not, I suppose. And there used to be a saying that Walmart is not company specific.
But I'm not going to specifically comment on UPS as an investment, but I will say that UPS has had some challenges negotiating things with Amazon and the like, and Amazon is, of course, on a fabulous job.
Again, not to give any recommendation on Amazon as far as becoming less dependent on these different delivery companies because they've built up their own network.
And UPS appears to be on the losing end of that, but of course, Amazon has had its own sort of job cuts, right?
Some of it is just to focus more on profitability.
Now, ultimately, if you want to correlate job cuts to the markets, often job cuts that are announced, the high profile ones, actually come often at the end of a period.
I remember in the early 90s, the market was recovering and then you had some major job cuts announced at the end of the process.
Even 12,000 jobs at UPS, I wouldn't call that quote unquote major major in the grand scheme of things.
I think it's noteworthy. Some people have said that this recession is rolling through different industries over time.
I don't know. I don't think this time is different.
Ultimately, the Federal Reserve is in a tight stance.
It does have an impact on the economy and it will grind its way through.
And it's a big reason why the Fed has pivoted away from inflation focus to unemployment focus.
The next phase is going to be cuts, right?
And almost always it ends up that we are in a recession.
And then the argument is how deep a recession will be.
And my thought is because of the lag effect, it's going to be more severe than many people are thinking.
Also, historically speaking, cuts when they start are almost always more significant than priced in at the outset.
Right, right.
And when we look at history, when rates have been hiked, they kind of hang out at a plateau for a bit.
Cuts start and then generally we enter recession and cuts just, we start cutting like crazy.
So to your point, folks are hoping one or two cuts might solve things.
And then they realize, oh, my gosh, we need to cut more.
And when they cut more slowly, then they often have to continue and then go more deeply at some point, right?
Because they, of course, know that there's a lag effect.
You can argue how much there is.
And they said, OK, we'll just fine-tune this.
There is this thinking that you're the magician at the Fed and you can fine-tune this and it's going to be just fine, right?
But ultimately, they look at the same stuff we do, right?
They only cook with salt.
And they try to keep a straight face when a bank has an issue saying, don't you worry and live happily above them.
And if everybody does it, then we can.
Well, so I'm going to ask you to guess here, Axel.
So I realize this isn't a fair question, but I value your expert guess.
Powell is definitely saying, hey, we're getting close to achieving our mission, right?
We don't want to be overconfident.
We don't want to declare mission accomplished too soon.
But as long as we keep seeing the good data we think we're going to see, we're going to get there.
And that's why we're talking about rate cuts right now, right?
We don't want to wait too long to cut when it's below 2% and then trajectory carries us slower than we want to go.
But we're almost there.
And that's why we're considering this, right?
So that's Powell's projected vibe.
There's a lot of other people saying there, no, no, there's something he's worried about, right, sort of like what you're talking about here.
He's worried about the lag effects.
He's worried about weakness again in the banking sector.
Or he's worried about liquidity crisis if the reverse repo program goes to zero.
And we haven't even talked about that yet.
So if you have anything to say about that, please do.
But do you think it's more likely that Powell, in Powell's mind, I'm trying to have you guess what's in Powell's mind,
is he confident or is he worried?
He's worried, of course.
I mean, why would he shift at his mission accomplished speech?
Let's not worry about hire longer anymore.
That's out.
Mission is accomplished.
Inflation is out.
Employment is it.
I mean, that's a sign that you're worried about something.
You can package that more nicely and saying, hey, we have succeeded in fighting inflation and the economy is more in balance.
And now we can focus more on employment.
I think that's what he said, right?
That means I'm freaking worried.
I mean, that's what that means.
By the way, a little fun fact, because we talk about the Fed statement in the beginning, there was a sentence that was taken out.
The sentence that was taken out, and it's relevant for this context, is the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient.
So that is no longer the case as a statement.
Did they replace it or just take it out?
They took it out.
Now, the odd part is actually not that they took it out.
The odd part that it was in there in the first place.
Why on earth would you put it in there unless you were worried?
You put it in there to tell the market, hey, don't worry.
But it's kind of like saying, I'm not going bankrupt tomorrow.
And by saying that, everybody thinks and knows that you're going to go bankrupt tomorrow.
So when you say the banking system is sound and resilient, you put something in there that you probably shouldn't.
And now they just took it out and normalize it.
It was just very comical in some ways. They took it out in the day when this one New York bank kind of said, hello, we have a little issue.
All right. Look, sorry, real quick, reverse repo program, anything you want to say about that?
There's been a lot of chatter about, oh, gosh, when that goes to zero, then things get real with QT.
The repo program?
Yeah.
They're going to have some liquidity issues, right?
I mean, Treasury is now saying they're going to try to have some buybacks.
We don't need to try to get more liquidity in the markets, do something.
But yes, I mean, money market funds love the reverse repo facility because they basically don't have to do anything.
They push a button once a day, they push all the money to the Fed and get cash back.
And the next day it has zero interest rate risk.
So it's more attractive than Treasuries.
And as the Federal Reserve has been winding that down, money market funds have had to actually do real work again, investing in Treasuries and in part commercial paper and whatnot.
Yeah, there are some liquidity concerns there.
What we do know, of course, is that the Federal Reserve is more sensitized to potential liquidity risks and will not hesitate more than a few minutes to add liquidity back in, maybe a few hours.
So we know what the game plan is for when they encounter an issue.
But yes, it's an issue.
And right away, the proper way to fix it is to simplify the system.
There's so much being piled on and making the system so complex these days that nobody really knows what the neutral rate is.
Nobody really knows where certain things should be calibrated.
And so they're just playing pretty much by arrow and saying, yep, this kind of works.
And then they give fancy speeches.
Yeah, which is just so at odds to me with the confidence that the Fed is projecting of like, oh, no, we're going to surgically engineer this butterfly soft landing.
And honestly, the credit with which the market gives the Fed the ability to do that.
Everybody believes this can be handled so precisely when you're saying everybody's groping the dark to a certain extent.
Well, first of all, people believe the Fed because the Fed has the bazooka. It's as simple as that, right?
And so I mentioned this on Top for Money before.
But the analogy is like saying, I'm going to shoot the ace out of the ace of spades card with my bazooka.
It's like, no, you're going to leave a 10-foot crater.
You can't be that precise.
Yes, and everybody knows that, I think, in many ways, right? But they still tag along.
And the place where you see the confidence of the market in that is in longer term rates, because the further you go out, the more it's a confidence game.
At the short end of the yield curve, a lot of it is, well, the rates are there, period, right?
And it's one of the things the Fed has taken away many market-based measures of the health of the market.
And so you've got to go out further out on the yield curve to read the tea leaf, so to speak, how much confidence the market has in the Fed.
And for the most part, the market believes the Fed will not be as tight as they are right now.
I'm not telling anybody anything they don't know, but it does mean there is an overarching confidence.
So if people just watch Thoughtful Money, they probably think, oh, my God, there's no confidence in central banks left anymore.
But in reality, that's not the case.
What I believe is that this confidence is gradually eroding.
And there's actually a trading strategy or investment philosophy you can have that supports that, and you might be at the better end of things.
The caution, though, to all of that is that as the Eurozone debt crisis has shown us, as things, as the dynamics become less stable.
And by the way, what the Fed is doing, if anything, it induces volatility by pivoting on these ideas and the philosophy.
But what happens is that the central banks are changing the rules of the game along the way, and that makes it very, very difficult.
So even in 2008, if you were absolutely right knowing what would happen, you could still lose a boatload of money because the rules of the game were changed all the time.
And so that's just the caveat when people say that the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, especially on the short side of things, you can get burned.
And I'm a practitioner. I've been burned as well.
But I'm also a survivor because I do manage risk, and so you always got to make sure that you only take positions that you can afford to be wrong on.
Well, absolutely. And I just want to reiterate your general point, which is one of the challenges of taking the bearish side against the markets
is that you have the entire status quo, you have the entire power structure working against you.
They're all doing whatever it takes to keep things going along for another day, another month, another quarter.
In a credit-driven system, you got it, because otherwise you have some.
And if you, in 2008, had you let market forces play out, you would have some sort of deflationary depression, implosion, whatever it is.
But that's not acceptable. And so you have the beginning of that, and then you have the printing press or whatever it is to push against it
because depression is not acceptable.
All right, great point. Depression is not acceptable. That is kind of the operating principle, I think, of the current power structure.
All right, look, just lightning round answers to these last two questions, Axel, and then we'll wrap it up here.
Max asks a very general question. I'm just putting it in here because he asked it.
Do you have any opinion about what's happening in energy right now?
I'm a simpleton. I talk about gold. As we talk, there's talk about a ceasefire in Israel and Hamas that knocked the price of oil down a little bit.
I have an opinion, but I don't think it's any more qualified than anybody else's opinion, so I'll just shut up here.
Okay, okay. I figured that might be the case. And this one's a little more personal. You might want to punt it, but I think you might want to talk about it.
I'm willing to ask you, which Cricket Gal says, "Did I hear Axel State? I bought a forest." Do you want to say anything about timber?
Well, again, not investment advice. I bought some forest in Finland, actually. I'm married to a Finn, and so I do spend some time there.
And it's like you see your money grow. I mean, that's the short of it, and there are ways you can enhance that. It's a way to diversify.
It's a hard asset that's different, right? I mean, in our core business, we manage over a billion in gold mining.
But there are other ways, other things you can do on the physical side. If you look at the forest in continental Europe, a lot of it is sick.
If you look at the forest in Eastern Europe, obviously Russia doesn't have any good quality and can't export anyway.
And so it's a way to diversify. We don't have a product, at least not at this stage, for anybody else to join that.
But obviously, if anybody's interested, we might be exploring that at some point in the future.
Not announcing anything here, but if we find a way that we can let others participate at some point, we might think about structuring something.
Great. But right now, you personally are a timber farmer because you find that an attractive asset class for yourself and your needs.
Yes, and I actually have worked in the forest myself. I've done that for many years, but now more actively on a little bigger scale, yes.
Okay, Axel, thanks so much. We've got to start wrapping things up here. Folks watching this, of course, the folks that are watching live are premium

Axel, as I introduced you, you are the founder and chief investment officer of Merck Investments. For folks that have enjoyed this conversation,
would like to follow you and your work in between your appearances on Thoughtful Money, where should they go?
If you can put my name back on so they know how to spell my fancy, well, that's the website, MerckInvestments.com. @AxelMerck is my Twitter handle.
And that's really where you can get my most up to date information on what I'm thinking.

All right. Great. Thanks, Axel. And just some quick housekeeping for folks. If you would like to participate in these live events with Axel and with other
experts that we bring in for live reactionary videos, then become a premium subscriber on the substack. To do that, just go to the substack
linked here, AdamTegert.substack.com. I want to remind folks to the point that Axel made about risk management. That's something that most
people really haven't been trained well how to do. To be honest, it's something that a lot of kind of rank and file financial advisors haven't
been well trained on how to do. So that's why on this channel, I always recommend that the vast majority of folks work under the guidance
of a good professional financial advisor who's experienced, is in good standing with the regulatory authorities, and can bring risk management
into your portfolio and takes into account all the macro issues that Axel and I talked about here. And when you add all those requirements
on, the universe actually gets pretty narrow. If you've got a good one who's doing that for you, great, you should stick with them. But if not,
consider scheduling a free consultation with one of the financial advisors that Thoughtful Money endorses. These are the ones you see on this
channel with me every week. The guys from New Harbor, Lance Roberts and his team at Real Investment Advice, Jonathan Wellum over at
Rocklink up in Canada. So to do that, just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com, fill out the short form there. You'll be contacted about getting a
consultation. These things, reminder, they're totally free. There's no commitment to work with these guys. It's just a free public service
they offer to help as many people as possible make as prudent decisions as possible around their wealth. One last thing, which is just a
reminder that the Thoughtful Money conference is coming up. It's going to be here faster than we expect. Again, that's on Saturday, March 16th.

thanks so much. It's always a joy having you on. Very much appreciate not just your expertise, but also your friendship. Thanks so much. I
hope we can do this again at the next Fed meeting. It's a joy that Thoughtful Money is growing and successful. Congratulations on
that. Thanks. Your advice has been an important part of that. Thanks so much, Axel. Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
