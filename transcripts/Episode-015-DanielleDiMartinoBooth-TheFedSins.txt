 Is that indeed the likely scenario from
 the year the lag effect arrives in force?
 Great to be with you, Adam. Hello.
 to see you always but such a privilege
 appear here on this new Thoughtful Money
 that especially while you're on the road.
 for the guidance, support, and counsel you
 Well, look, let's move on to the discussion. I got a lot of questions based upon your recent work,
 but if we can start with the general just sort of level setting question I like to ask at the
 beginning. What's your current assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
 So I think that we inflected early. I think Santa Claus arrived early and that we saw that
 in this magnificent outperformance in the month of November that was driven by the recession
 celebration and it always works this way. The markets always say, "Oh my gosh, this is so
 exciting. We're going into recession," and every time that we've seen, which was the case in October
 2023, every time we've seen 50 US states, 5-0, with rising state unemployment rates and that is
 the case according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There's a 51 total count including
 Washington DC. For those who love data, the only holdout in October with the non-farm payroll print
 was the state of Texas. So even though Texas had falling non-farm payrolls, they also had a falling
 unemployment rate, the only exception in the month of October. Now the Bureau of Labor Statistics only
 introduced this series in 1976, so we only have nine precedents to look back on, but in nine of
 the nine instances in which 50 states had rising unemployment rates, the subsequent month followed
 with a rising national unemployment rate and a rising, excuse me, and falling non-farm payrolls,
 a negative contractionary print. I bring this up to contextualize the fact that following those 50
 months, the first and second and in some instances third of those nine episodes saw the S&P 500 go up.
 There is initially a woohoo, it's hats off time, the feds are going to come riding to the rescue,
 the mindset's always been there since 1976, that the feds are going to come riding to the rescue,
 that there's going to be massive easing when you see that first negative payroll print,
 which might not be the case. You know, the United Auto Workers strike ended and the Bureau of Labor
 Statistics has been majorly monkeying with the data, but what we know right now is regardless
 of what the statisticians say, the United States economy is in recession. It appears that the
 biggest bond market rally since 1980 that occurred in the month of November pulled forward some of
 the Santa Claus rally effect into the month of November and as you said in your introduction,
 we continue to celebrate the lag effects pushing the economy more deeply into recession and it is
 indeed lag effects that are playing out when you describe credit markets. Okay, so if I had to put
 you on a team here in this game board you would be on team lag effect, is that fair to say?
 That indeed it is going to matter. We've had a lot of people saying it hasn't really arrived
 that much yet so maybe it's not going to arrive this time. I don't think you think this time is
 different. This time's not different and moreover we forget that in June of 2022, excuse me, 2023,
 June of 2022 quantitative tightening started has not stopped so the lag effect
 that is based on the current tightening as we speak will play out later and the final rate hike
 of June 2023 will also play out with a lag 12 to 18 months into the future meaning one of the
 reasons that we say oh look the Fed is pushing on a string is because when they start to begin to ease
 they're fighting an uphill battle of sorts because they're easing against the effect of the lagged
 effects of monetary policy so come June 2024 it could be the first rate cut. The first rate cut
 could come in March. It doesn't matter. Their efforts are thwarted by the lag effect continuing
 to push its way into the economy from whatever that last marginal level of tightening was. Again
 in the case of quantitative tightening, the one that continues.
 Okay, so I'm going to try to pull up a chart here just to what you just mentioned there. So
 here's a chart that shows the federal funds rate and you can see every major recession that
 we've had here was preceded by an aggressive run-up in the federal funds, so an aggressive
 tightening campaign. We then kind of hang out this plateau for a little bit and then the Fed realized
 oh my gosh I over tightened or something's breaking or whatever and I've got to run back to
 the rescue here and they start cutting but as they cut the economy falls into recession
 and it's falling into that recession because of the lag effect. That's when the lag effect is
 finally arriving at force and it's like a raging hurricane where it's going to just rage
 for a good while and it's overwhelming. The Fed scrambled it to cut rates here so it takes a long
 time for those rate cuts to finally begin to net outweigh the lag effect here. So in many ways I
 think you're just calling for history to repeat here to a certain extent, correct? That is correct
 with the caveat that the average period between the final rate hike and the first rate cut is
 seven months in the chart that you're looking at. God love David Rosenberg, but the average lag
 effect is seven months. I don't foresee at least Jay Powell's federal reserve lowering the federal
 funds rate in January of 2024 call it oh I don't know next month, Adam, but that would be your
 seven-month average. Interesting. Okay, so let's talk about that for a second and I'm
 torn here because there's two different questions I wanted to ask you and you're kind of
 going to the second one first, but when you and I last saw each other we were in New Orleans
 at a panel and on the panel you said essentially that disinflation is currently in the driver's seat
 and you've noted in some of your recent work that it's not just a US phenomenon, it's
 going global. You in the panel in New Orleans raised the specter of deflation, actual deflation
 coming up. So you said basically, "Look, for those that are thinking the Fed's going to cut
 and we're going to get inflation coming out of that, maybe," I think you actually said, "Once the
 Fed really goes into full rescue mode, that might be accompanied with MMT and all sorts
 of crazy things that could eventually someday lead to rip-roaring inflation," but that is not what's
 going to happen now and that's not what folks should be trading on or positioning on. They should
 be positioning for first more disinflation and then potentially deflation next year. Does that
 remain the case for you? It does. Adam, I'm going to throw a question out at you and ask you what
 do you think the effect of the market would be if we woke up one day and it said, "Gee, month over
 month inflation was negative 0.6 for the month or month over
 month inflation was negative 0.4%?" How do you think markets would react to such an event?
 Well, I mean I think they'd probably
 freak out because we're in sort of a bad news is good news scenario, like you
 said. Well, anyways, go ahead. So France and Italy last week, a week before
 we filmed this, they had month over month negative prints just like that. So we are in a world already
 of developed nations experiencing on a month over month basis deflation. I would argue for those who
 think that the Fed's going to be the first to ease, they might want to keep a closer eye on Christine
 Lagarde. France is in recession. My biggest signpost for deflationary pressure is backlogs.
 Backlogs in any soft survey, whether it be S&P Global or ISM, in the ISM manufacturing report
 backlogs fell to 39 here in the United States. That's a three handle, not a typo. And they're
 in the 30s throughout most of Europe with France being the one who's falling into recession the
 most quickly. The second largest economy in Europe with Germany saying on the morning of the day that
 we're filming this today with Germany saying it looks like given the service PMI that we are going
 to stay in recession in the fourth quarter of 2023. Again, when disinflation turns into deflation,
 Adam, you had better get out of the way because it tends to ignite a negative, an adverse feedback
 loop where the credit conditions feed off of themselves. So you end up with, oh, I don't know,
 23% year overgrowth in German insolvencies making what's happening in the United States look like a
 walk in the park. So we have to be careful. We have to be careful of disinflation morphing into
 deflation. And that is one of the themes that we're looking at next year with a lot of people
 tempted to say, oh my God, the dollar's going to die. And I'm like, you need to watch other
 countries first and see where we are relative to those deflationary impulses setting off. And by
 the way, I'm just going to give S&P a shameless plug. They introduced the Canadian services PMI,
 brand new index. It's flagging deflation. Okay, so already showing contracting warning signs.
 So great points, Danielle. Sort of one of the truisms is that collapse happens from the outside
 in. It's your weaker players that fall first. And so you're looking around the global economic
 chessboard and saying, hey, in the countries that aren't doing as well as the US, the trajectory
 they're heading in is actually into recession and potentially deflation. I mean, you talked about
 Europe, which everybody knows has been kind of second wind for a while here, but now it's not
 just the smaller countries there. It's actually the big guys, the France's, the Germany's that
 are really entering the danger zone now. So we can kind of look at that as probably a preview of
 coming attractions to us here. We can. I mean, I would just put a disclaimer in there that
 suggests that Asia's stabilizing. Now, I would not say it's rip roaring and it's going to
 fly into recovery, but it is stabilizing. The situation in Asia is stabilizing,
 so we also have to be cognizant of that having its influence on the global
 economy, but again, it's all relative and in our world we tend to think in terms of the dollar,
 the euro, the dollar, the euro. Okay, and it is interesting, and I think you and I have talked
 about this in the past, which is when we fell into the global financial crisis, Asia,
 largely China, was kind of there to ride to the rescue. They had a very relatively
 much lower relative amount of debt in China at that time and they basically just went on a
 borrowing binge that kind of helped pull the global economy out of the global recession.
 Looking around, we don't really have somebody positioned to do that this well. So like you said,
 Asia's maybe stabilizing, but they're not showing signs of strength and they're certainly not
 growing at historically high rates here. So there really is no tractor beam to pull the
 global economy out this time, right? I mean, it was kind of fascinating to see Moody's investor
 service have a leak several hours before their formal press announcement that they were going
 to be downgrading the sovereign debt of China due to its over indebtedness and it was a leak
 six hours prior to the release, but the immediate effect that it had on copper. So again, in 2015,
 2016, there was this massive global industrial recession, similar situation in 2008-2009,
 and China came riding to the rescue of South America. So many exporting nations of resources.
 That's not happening right now. They're just trying to hold things together.
 Okay, so if you think that deflation is the bigger worry for next year,
 let's now trundle over to the Fed who's trying to engineer this soft landing and try to keep
 confidence in this butterfly soft landing that's going to happen. What do you think is more likely?
 It sounds like you think the Fed will actually achieve its inflation target because
 we got to be worried about deflation. Is it going to be able to claim victory and say, "Yes,
 we tamed inflation," or is it going to be more along the path to that trying to happen
 at these high interest rates, this high cost of capital, the lag effects? Is it going to be
 more something breaking? So it sounds like Fed policy eventually is going to change at some
 point. It's either going to achieve its mandate or something's going to break. Which do you put
 your money on more? So what we're seeing play out in commercial real estate because of what I call
 the WeWork effect, which was the acceleration of a typically slow moving fallout victim of any credit
 crunch. Because of the WeWork effect accelerating kind of the exposure of gee, that underlying
 collateral isn't worth squat. We thought banks had issues with unrealized losses on their risk
 free assets. Good God, look at their loan books. So that was a 2023 story accelerating into 2024,
 but we've actually got non-financial refinancings to concern ourselves with in 2024. The high yield
 bond market, the investment grade bond market, there's a lot of debt to be refinanced in 2024.
 Companies have had, I don't know, over the last 40 years, the luxury of being able to preemptively
 refinance their debt if they get inside of a 12 month window. And we really are talking about
 March, April of 2024 when high yield issuers get inside that 12 month window when things really
 pick up in the spring of 2025. If I'm a credit rating agency, if I'm PricewaterhouseCoopers, PWC,
 I can reclassify that debt that's inside of a 12 month refinancing window as being a current
 liability. Talk about effect on credit ratings. So people need to understand that the lag effect
 is going to be extremely real in the first quarter, moving past the first quarter into 2024
 around the time the market right now is hoping for that first rate cut out of J-PAL. They're hoping
 for that March FOMC meeting to be the first rate cut of 25 basis points.
 There's a lot I want to dig into there. So the question I want to get to is do you think the
 market's going to be disappointed with that timing projection? In other words, do you think PAL is
 going to cut that soon? But before we get there, you talked about basically the maturity wall
 where we have all these corporations that are going to have to eventually
 refinance at what will be substantially higher rates. I think on average probably more than twice
 what the debt they currently have on the books is costing them and you talked about how that
 doesn't happen when that debt matures and the company has to borrow. You actually
 begin to see the effects before that because you could have things like the credit rating
 agencies starting to downgrade these companies, but also you just have the boardrooms of these
 companies where they're looking at -- so far they've been sitting on the cheap debt and
 just sort of hoping that, "Oh, hopefully our buddy PAL is going to come through for us and
 bring rates down so by the time we have to refinance things are going to be low again,"
 but if not then they're looking at that compressing time frame and saying, "You know what?
 We're all of a sudden going to have a big hit to our P&L from this interest expense.
 We got to preemptively figure out how we're going to jettison some expenses out of this company so
 that that thing's not an existential threat for us," and that's where you begin to get into the layoffs
 story and that's I think one factor that's been keeping things coming along in many ways much
 more sustainably than folks imagined could happen and that's just because companies
 haven't been shedding employees at a big enough scale to matter. You and I have talked a lot about
 the increasing layoffs that have been going on and you do a good job of highlighting them
 on your Twitter account but they haven't really been at the level yet to push the unemployment
 up right up to the point where folks are starting to worry about it but that may be coming from here.
 So I'll take a beat here but are you sort of expecting sort of a tsunami of
 lag effect related impacts as this debt maturity wall really starts to become real over the -- well,
 I guess sort of starting Q2 of next year, like you said, that's when people really start to have to
 base the music on this. Right and I think that that's why you're seeing this
 bizarre phenomenon of companies trying to buy their debt back out of open markets
 and being labeled as defaulting, defaulters. So there are some signs of desperation
 but to your point, the founder of dailyjobcuts.com, which I'm constantly singing his praises because
 he's combing the landscape of the entire country looking for oh gee there's 13 Rite Aid stores that
 are going to close or oh well there's the Remington gun factory that's going to be closing in upstate
 New York and they won't be unionized anymore. They're relocating to Georgia. That's 270 employees.
 Or a mom and pop diner in Culver, Indiana is closing. So from the smallest businesses to the
 small medium enterprises to the largest companies to layoffs, this guy manages to really do a great
 job of tracking not just layoff announcements, which we're used to from Challenger Gray and
 Christmas, but also closings. So in November 2022, he tracked 139 closings. In November 2023,
 seasonality went to hell in a handbasket and he tallied 280. A month earlier than we typically see
 the baby with the bathwater effect of December and January are always your biggest months for
 companies just absolutely cleaning house. But we saw early this year and it manifested very clearly
 in the bond market and falling bond yields. Because remember the bond market's always a
 step ahead of the stock market, but something as micro and granular as what I just described
 played out in a great big bond market. But again, we're seasonally weaker than we should be heading
 into the seasonally weakest months of the year for layoffs and for company closures.
 Really interesting. And of course, what happens in those small to medium enterprises
 is actually much more important employment wise than what happens in the big corporate layoffs,
 just because it's the fleet of small businesses that represent the majority of jobs in America.
 So even though when Facebook lays off people that gets the headlines, but what really matters is
 what's happening across the overall fleet. Super interesting. So you mentioned the phenomenal
 November that both stocks and bonds had, but bonds now look like they are not going to have
 that unprecedented third down year in a row, or at least US treasuries don't look like they're
 going to have that unprecedented third down year in a row. So to your point that the bond market
 may be sniffing something out here, you said that's where the much smarter money tends to hang out
 and interest rates are heavily influenced by inflation expectations and maybe the bond market
 is waking up to your outlook, Danielle, where it's thinking inflation actually might be a
 lot lower next year and so we need to start reflecting that in bond prices from here.
 I'd love to get your response on that and then let me tie that to the question I was going to ask,
 which is, "So what do you think the Fed's going to do from here?" In other words,
 Powell has still been saying hire for longer. Do you expect him to cut as soon as you said the
 market was thinking kind of around beginning of Q2 next year or would he only do that if absolutely
 forced to at this point? So I think there was definitely an overreaction to Powell
 following the lead and it almost always happens this way. Christopher Waller is his chief
 lieutenant. He is as close to being Powell's mouthpiece and markets reacted appropriately
 to Waller signaling that the Fed was ready for a third consecutive pause. Powell
 validated that viewpoint but I think markets definitely took it one step too far in a
 different sense, Adam. Markets could be right about March. Markets could be right about May
 but I'm following quantitative tightening because Powell has stated clearly even if we start to
 lower the federal funds rate, I want to continue pressing forward with shrinking the Fed's balance
 sheet. It is the shrinkage of the Fed's balance sheet especially after the reverse repo facility
 is completely depleted or close to being depleted that you'll all of a sudden start to feel with a
 much greater magnitude is the effect of quantitative tightening. We've seen other deposits
 on commercial bank liabilities. We've seen them fall from just shy of 17 trillion to about 15
 trillion. A lot of liquidity has been depleted from the system. It's his aim to continue on that
 path unless markets do something very systemic in nature and it would be reflected in the credit
 markets and issuance markets freezing up. My point is a 25 basis point rate cut ain't going to do
 diddly squat for a chief financial officer who's looking at a doubling of his recancing rate, not
 squat, not squat, squat, squat. So that's super, super important. You mentioned a number of things
 here. So one is we might get a rate cut as soon as folks are hoping here but it
 it may not matter, meaning it might still be a hawkish world where QT is still
 happening here.
 But the narrative is, "Once the Fed starts cutting then it's back to unicorns and rainbows and
 liquidity for everybody," and you're basically saying, "No, it just might be slightly less expensive
 debt with continued tightening going on." So the beatings may very well continue and I think
 that's just a really important mindset shift for those that are in the team pivot means
 everything's awesome again. I mean it's like, "Oh my gosh, we're only gonna be flogged five times today
 so instead of six, whoo!" Yeah, exactly. Just kind of like disinflation doesn't mean that inflation
 is over, it just means it's not growing as much. So shameless plug, I am not insensitive to
 to build up inflation in the system in the fact that a loaf of bread or a gallon of milk is still
 way more expensive than it was prior to the pandemic. That cannot take away from
 disinflationary and deflationary forces manifesting in something worse which is no income at all.
 So I want to be clear about that. I'm not insensitive but what I'm cognizant of is the
 effect that disinflation and deflation have on people's paychecks which sometimes go from
 something to nothing. Yeah, all right, I want to go into this territory with you. Let me just put a
 pin in the question. I do want to have you clarify for folks. You mentioned the reverse repo
 facility and maybe we'll answer this first then we'll get to the other one and I don't think many
 people, many regular people really know what that is so maybe if you could just define it super
 briefly but basically that's been coming down. It's been providing liquidity. It's been a source
 of liquidity in the system here so if you can explain how it's serving is that and then
 on its current trajectory it is going to get depleted and it is not going to be net helping
 and then the tightening, as you said, will really be felt more intensely at that point in time. So
 can you just sort of explain the role that the reverse repo facility is performing here?
 So I'm going to put on my analogy hat as a third generation gear head. So when the Fed was
 raising interest rates what they were doing was they were building up the thickness of a shock
 absorber. So a lot of money market funds said, "Hey, I don't want to buy a treasury bill and
 lock my money up if I know that within six weeks the Fed's going to raise interest rates again.
 So I want to continue to take advantage on an overnight basis of a growing shock absorber,
 of getting more money on an overnight basis. Well, when June rolled along and that was the last
 rate hike and then there was the pause and then another pause and every time there's been a pause
 from the perspective of a money market fund the thickness of the shock absorber has gotten
 thinner and thinner and thinner because if the Fed's not going to be raising interest rates
 anymore by golly you better hurry and lock in the shortest term rates you possibly can in treasury
 bills which treasury secretary Janet Yellen has been all together too happy to sell. But every
 dollar, every hundred billion of dollars that bleeds out of the reverse repo facility because
 money market funds no longer see the Fed as raising rates so they're saying, "I'm going to go
 buy those bills that Yellen's selling so that I can lock in a high rate." And just in case,
 God forbid, we start to see that the Fed's actually going to be lowering interest rates.
 We really don't want to be in this reverse repo facility because then instead of a shock absorber
 we're going to be falling into potholes and actually not making as much money on treasury
 bills as we could have locked in. But once that's depleted then treasury bill sales will start to
 pull money out of the broader financial system. It won't be depleting this repository that was
 sitting out there. It will actually be pulling dollars out of the system so you'll start to see
 an effect on bank reserves which we have not seen yet but that will be the case. Alright, thank
 you for doing that. So at the current trajectory, just ball parking it, when will it be depleted?
 So I think Barclays put an estimate out there that suggested it was I think maybe going to
 be in May. Don't quote me but I believe it's a matter of months. In fact, we did see a little
 bit of an uptick in the facility so I believe it's a matter of months but not many months.
 Okay, so sort of like a quarter or two. Yes, a quarter or two and it coincides with
 and there's no coincidence, it should coincide with when the market is anticipating
 rate cuts to begin because then you would be penalized for being in the facility.
 Okay, thank you for clarifying all that for everybody. Got my prom, Danielle. I have so
 many great questions I want to ask you, limited time but I'm going to keep trying to do the best
 I can here. You mentioned wanting to not appear insensitive to the real pain
 that deflation can cause and
 I'm going to lump recession into that as well and I just -- the video that was
 appeared in this channel before, this one's going to appear, Danielle. I was talking with Wolf Richter
 who, full transparency, I think has a different recession prediction than you. He's
 not super confident what's going to happen next year but that being said, he really thinks
 one should happen next year and we talked about sort of the defamation that the business cycle has
 experienced pretty much over the past 20 years due to a lot of intervention and
 recession is a healthy part of the business cycle. It's what gets rid of the malinvestment.
 It's what keeps things from metastatizing to the point where they can bring the entire
 system down or just create a lot more pain for people and for a variety of reasons our central
 planners have decided that they really want to try to do away with the business cycle and just
 have it sort of be eternal summer and sadly many consumers like summer and so have sort
 of been cheering them on and we've gotten into this trap of, "Well, every time winter
 threatens to arrive the central planners pump in a ton of liquidity," and the consumers have
 gotten to the point of saying expecting that and sort of demanding it. "Hey, we want more
 liquidity because we have bills to pay today," but of course that then ends up creating things
 like inflation and you get in these weird scenarios where consumers are demanding more of
 the thing that created the problem they're having to deal with. So I think people like Wolf,
 I would put myself in this camp and my question to you is are you in this camp as well where,
 yes, there's a real human cost that comes to recession and when natural market forces of
 deflation take over, but to a certain extent maybe this is just the tough and needed medicine
 that we really need right now and if we could take the lumps but then get back to a more
 normalized business cycle, it would be better for everybody and if we could just demand
 it as a populace and embrace it as a leader or a group of elected leaders to say, "Yeah,
 just like we've done in past generations with this country, yeah, there's an important war to fight
 or whatever. If we want to have a better tomorrow, well, we got to tighten our belts and
 we got to mutually sacrifice a little bit to let the malinvestment clear but we will all be
 better off in just a couple of years from this." You're sort of nodding as I'm saying this but am I
 sounding crazy to you or is this a song sheet that sounds similar to the one in your head?
 I've never been a Keynesian. I've always kind of been in the von Mises camp of the world and
 do believe that creative destruction is a healthy force and that when you get
 when you expunge from the system unprofitable poor business model companies, you actually make way
 for new entrants who are going to end up hiring more employees and so the creative destruction
 ends up creating jobs in the end. It becomes a virtuous cycle. And sorry to interrupt but it
 also gives an appreciation for risk. People don't take stupid risks when they know that there's
 the potential to be held accountable for them. That's absolutely 100% correct.
 The part I don't want to be insensitive about though is we have seen, of course,
 we've got bankruptcies running at the fastest pace since 2010, large company bankruptcies in 2023,
 but what we're also seeing is this phenomena of companies having used up so much of their runway
 in using the runway as their balance sheet. So they're so over indebted that many of the
 bankruptcies that we've seen in 2023 have segued into becoming liquid liquidations.
 You could say liquidation is the most extreme form of creative destruction and that would be true.
 That being said, it's a much more destructive force on the economy and it's much harder
 on individuals against a backdrop of a federal reserve that hoovered up a third of all mortgage
 backed securities leaving mobility very much impaired such that it's more difficult for
 American families to move to where tomorrow's jobs are in the current framework. And so there are
 so many nuances and different ways to go about looking at this but I can't celebrate what I'm
 seeing on DailyJobCuts.com. I understand it but I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that
 we don't have enough time to get into this but private equity muscled its way into small and
 medium enterprises where it didn't belong. So you ended up with smaller companies, medium companies
 with more debt than they would otherwise have in prior cycles. Right, totally hollowed out
 balance sheet wise. I'm right there with you, sister. We're paying a higher price now
 than we would have paid had Greenspan or Bernanke or Yellen had more courage.
 And the fact that Bernanke's first book was called The Courage to Act, I've always
 said the greater courage would always have been to not act. And that would put us in so much,
 but I mean I read about repo men being run down with somebody with a gun. I mean the current
 household default cycle, it does not make for pretty headlines. It doesn't and
 it's hard to watch and we know that there's going to be kind of backlash to all
 this. I don't like what this recession is going to look like because there will be innocence
 as opposed to speculators taken down. Sure, but if I can I want to press on the
 sensitive subject just a little bit more because to continue the status quo, a policy response
 and hollowing out and whatnot will only set us up for greater collateral damage down the road.
 So again this is sort of the courage to act or the courage to take your hands off
 the system and just let natural forces take place. Now you're a unique person to have this
 conversation with because you have worked with the federal reserve. So if I sort of
 made you empress right now, I'm sure that you would try to cleanse
 a lot of the excess in the system. Would you try to do that in some sort of managed way
 or would you take more of a, "It's going to hurt. It's going to maybe be two really painful
 years, but we're going to let the forest fire burn and then we are going to rebuild
 from a much more sane baseline going forward." I honestly don't know the best way to deal with this.
 I can make arguments on both sides but I'm curious to hear what your thoughts are.
 Well so we already have seen a year of forest fires. I mean the current
 Powell pivot is the seventh in a row that's been called for since this campaign started in June of
 2022. So Powell has held fast for a heck of a lot longer than most people ever thought he would and
 he's only held on by virtue of the fact that it has been orderly. It's been one company going
 out of business at a time. They were able to come in with what's now a $113 billion facility
 and prevent a massive contagion throughout the banking system that would have required the Fed
 slamming the Fed funds rate back down to zero. Had Silicon Valley Bank completely unglued and
 we would have had all the dominoes falling and every single major regional bank across America
 fall that would have been a disaster and it would have prompted much more violent reaction from the
 Fed, from the Treasury, from the FDIC, from everybody in Washington DC you could possibly name.
 To date the fire has not run out of control. The question is once this reverse repo facility which
 was once in excess of $2.5 trillion, once you completely make this shock absorber go away
 and you're hitting the axle and you're hitting potholes, does something systemic crop up? And
 Adam, I don't know. I cannot answer the question. I don't know. We're too far into an experiment
 to say what the other side is going to look like but I can tell you that we're 75% of the way
 out of this experience and nothing systemic has broken loose. We haven't had a Lehman yet.
 Okay. How much do you lie awake at night worrying that we are going to hit one before this is over?
 So Jay Powell, and this is something that we should talk about on a completely different
 episode. Jay Powell right now is trying to push through regulations that would sever the very
 lucrative link between the non-banking system, call it $250 trillion, and the conventional
 banking system globally call it $180 trillion. As one of my friends likes to say, it's not a
 coincidence that JP Morgan's business model is 75% capital markets. So if we could possibly push
 through regulations that effectively cut the oxygen off of the private capital market,
 then we would be so much better off for it in the end. And I would argue, Adam, again,
 this is something that we do not have enough time, we do not have enough time to begin to explore
 Basel III Endgame. But if you end up taking away all of the speculators' toys,
 and that's what Basel III Endgame is, it's taking away their toys. By the way, the toys only function
 in a zero interest rate world with quantitative easing running full blown. And that's why it's so
 critical that Jay Powell have a little bit longer to hang on. And perversely, that 75% of the people
 on my Twitter feed are wrong. And that there's no stimulus check forthcoming before, I don't know,
 March of 2025. And the inability to distinguish between forms of fiscal stimulus is an Achilles
 heel for the current public in Fintuit, if you will. But another day, we can talk about
 regulations and how important they are. And again, removing the oxygen from the speculators.
 But in the here and now, if there's one thing that any of your guests on this wonderful new platform
 have not illustrated, illuminated, highlighted, it's the fact that the form of fiscal stimulus
 matters most. And if it ain't cash, helicopter money directly deposited into people's bank
 accounts, which immediately ignites inflation, it's not going to do as much for the economy.
 And this House of Representatives that's led by some crazy Republicans is not passing anything
 between now and when the next Congress is sworn in. Okay, great. That's exactly where I was going.
 Real quick, folks, if you'd like to ask Danielle to be as generous as she can be in terms of coming
 back on this program again at some point in early 2024 to dive deeply into that severing of the
 banking systems ties with the non-banking system, let me know in the comment section below if
 interest is high enough. I will go back to Danielle and bended knee and try to get her to sign up
 for a time early next year. Yes, all right, this fiscal stimulus, what I've heard a lot of people
 say, Danielle, is because I've talked a lot about how the Fed and really the banking system have
 been putting on the monetary and lending breaks on the economy. They've been hitting that pedal
 since Powell started his tightening campaign, but fiscally they've been jamming on
 the gas pedal. We've had near record deficit spending this year and a lot of
 people have said, "Yeah, they're doing it because they can get away with it," and, "Hey, there's
 an election coming up in a year," and, "Hey, they can just continue doing this up right up until
 the November election next year." You're saying, you're shaking your head as I'm saying this,
 you're saying, "No, no, no, don't count on that, folks." So you just put your finger on the fact that
 this Congress is now a very divided one. What other pushback would you have on that assumption
 that people are saying, "Oh, no, no, they can fiscally stimulate as much as they need to up until
 the election?" Well, they haven't fiscally stimulated anything since September the 14th
 when the employer retention credit was put on hold. Now, the infrastructure, the chips act,
 the electric vehicle, the DEI, all this stuff, it's not that it's not deficit spending because
 it is and we see it in a great big gigantic way, it's that it's not being delivered to households
 and if you're not getting the money directly, then you're still having to go through either
 the banking channel to deliver easier credit, that ain't happening, or you're having to go through
 some unionized pork belly traditional type of fiscal spending that takes a long time to make
 its way through the economy is by definition not profitable and unproductive and bleeds its way
 out there. Now, what people perceive as liquidity, which is the depletion of the reverse repo
 facility due to Treasury Secretary Yellen selling treasury bills, it's a different dynamic and it's
 manifested in one hell of a November in the stock market, I get that, but as far as people saying,
 "Oh, they'll spend money right up until election day to buy those votes," that train pulled out
 of the station with the end of the employee retention credit on September the 14th, 2023,
 which at last check was about three months ago. All right, so very important note to take from
 what Danielle's saying, which is that if you've been sort of expecting the administration,
 Congress, etc to keep the party going for as long as it can to improve its odds for the election,
 you're basically saying, "Uh-uh," because what really matters is the dollars that get injected
 directly into households. That's what stimulates the economy. That spigot is now fully shut off.
 Fully shut off. They reduced emergency food stamps. They reduced emergency Medicaid. The
 paycheck protection program was a long time ago. The employee retention credit ended September the
 14th. Nothing is out there that is improving people's cash balance in their checking account,
 nada. Okay. Danielle, I could keep talking with you for easily another three or four hours on
 just the topics we've identified so far. I am going to have to land the plane here given where
 we are time-wise and thank you for giving us so much your time. Always an excellent interview.
 Let me just go back to Powell for a second because I'm going to give my assessment of your
 assessment of him and then you can react to it. I think he has earned a fair amount of your respect
 over his tenure here and you can correct me if that's totally wrong but it seems that
 he has had more cojones, if you will, to certainly go higher for longer than for sure a lot of the
 people on the Fed itself wanted him to. I'm sure he's been getting a lot of pressure to be a little
 bit more dovish. You have talked many times about how he's sort of been surviving successive rounds
 of Game of Thrones at the Fed. He is doing some unpopular things. This thing that you
 alluded to about him trying to basically enforce regulation to end the party for the banking system,
 those are some pretty powerful people that he's disappointing with that. So what's your
 deadpool on this guy? How much longer do you think he's going to be able to stay in his job?
 Well, I think the last time that a case went up in front of the Supreme Court
 for trying to fire the head of a federal agency for cause, which Trump tried and failed to do,
 was 1873. So it's very difficult to fire him for cause. That's the only reason to get him out
 and kind of like neither political party wants the filibuster. It's the best parallel that I
 can draw for you succinctly. And that is why the Federal Reserve Board would do everything in its
 power to keep Powell in his place until the firing for cause went to the Supreme Court so that a
 future president couldn't just have willy-nilly the ability to say, "You're out of here. You're
 fired." Did I say that? Yes, I did. So the Federal Reserve Board would probably keep whoever the
 chair is, whether it was Powell or somebody else, they would keep the chair in their place until
 the Supreme Court ruled on whether or not it was legal to have taken them out for cause because
 that precedent is so old back to the late 1800s. So I think Powell is okay through May of 2026
 when you're speaking of the Constitution. Okay, okay.
 Now, he may be run over by a train. We forget that home builders would send Paul Volcker two by fours
 and threatened his life. So I'm not saying he's not under threat. I'm saying according to the
 Constitution and the Supreme Court, it would be very difficult to unseat him. Okay, and was I
 accurate in saying that maybe he has to a certain degree earned more respect from you than perhaps
 you might have had at the beginning of his tenure? So he was confirmed by the Senate with 80 votes in
 May of 2022. He did an interview with NPR marketplace that day, 14 times in that interview, and he never
 sits for interviews. He cited the 2% inflation target. He has not backed down since he was
 confirmed. He lost my respect in his first term. He has regained it in my second term. It is his to lose.
 Okay, all right. Well, look, heading into the home stretch here, I just want to ask you about
 your market outlook. We've talked a lot about your economic outlook, but what do you expect
 2024 to be in terms of a year for the markets and are there any assets that you think
 you particularly favor going into whatever outlook you see? I'm going to guess you're probably a
 decent fan of owning treasury bonds here given your deflationary and recessionary outlook, but
 I don't want to put words in your mouth. I absolutely am and bear in mind the quicker
 inflation falls, the more real real rates are. They don't fall as quickly, so the tightening in that sense
 continues unabated. I would certainly be looking for an unfavored class and that is very high
 dividend payers who are not going to cut their dividends. So anybody who's got cash flow and pays
 a nice dividend, they've beaten that asset class to pulp in the most recent pure liquidity driven
 now we're back into meme stocks, etc. So anything that's a bona fide balance sheet
 company, I would certainly be in favor of whether you're talking about their bonds or
 their stock if the dividends going to stay safe and I would think that the financial disruption
 that we've got over the near-term horizon would continue to favor gold. That's a very controversial
 statement but there I am. Okay, so things for folks to go consider. US treasuries,
 high dividend, blue chip companies, both their stocks and maybe the corporate debt of those types
 of companies and then gold. Alright, well look, in wrapping up here, got a couple questions I'm
 going to ask you just as we we land the plane here. One I'm going to ask you in just a minute
 and once you start thinking about it is a new question I've just started asking our guests
 here. You're the second one I'm asking it of and it's going to be what's a non-financial,
 non-monetary investment that you think you would encourage folks to consider investing in right now?

 get those notes. So to go to the sub stack, whether you sign up for free or premium, just go to
 adamtaggett.substack.com. Okay, Danielle, now we're at the final question here. In terms of being
 wealthy, yeah, money matters but it certainly by no stretch is the only thing to living a
 rich life. What's a non-financial investment that you would encourage folks to consider making
 right now? So when you use the word rich I immediately think of family but I'm not going to
 use that as my answer but that's always my first answer. I'll say this in just a few words. Start in
 sales, the hardest thing you can do, start in sales and take the course in college you don't want to
 take. Take the hardest class you can imagine. Just do it and those two things, challenging yourself
 to do the things you do not want to do will make everything in life on a relative basis that much
 easier. That is a fantastic answer. I love this question. I'm beginning to get these answers that
 I just wasn't expecting and they're great. Those are two great answers, Danielle. Thank you so much
 for doing this. Alright folks, in addition to this interview with Danielle, if you're still not done
 watching as I mentioned that video I recorded with Wolf Richter earlier in the week who's got a bit
 of a different perspective than most of the recent guests on here, it's a good challenge to our
 assumptions. I'll put up a link to it right here so you can watch that afterwards. Danielle, can't
 thank you enough. Everyone else, thanks so much for watching. Thank you.
