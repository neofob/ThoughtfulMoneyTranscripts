Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Tegert.
Here at the end of 2023, confidence in the economy and the financial markets is a lot
higher than it was at this time a year ago.
Is that confidence justified?
Or will 2024 deliver a rude awakening?
To find out, we turn to the experience and wisdom of financial advisor Ted Oakley, managing
partner and founder of Oxbow Advisors.
Ted has over 40 years experience helping clients, mostly high net worth families, protect and
build wealth through good times and bad.
We'll find out how he's currently positioning his clients assets for the coming year.
Ted, it's wonderful to see you again.
Thank you so much for joining us today.
You bet, Adam.
I'm glad to be here.
Always like to see how you're doing.
I think you've been doing great on everything.
Well, thanks.
And we're doing this on the new Thoughtful Money channel.
We are officially just starting the second week of it here, Ted.
So I'm so pleased and honored that you're one of the early guests getting this channel
kicked off.
There has been a great lineup of August guests, but you are right there at the top of the
roster.
So thank you for making the time in your day to be part of our initial launch here.
Lots of questions for you.
I'll try to be respectful of your time, but I'm probably going to try to pack two interviews
worth of questions into one if I can get away with it.
But if we can, let's start off at the general question I like to ask you every time we sit
down together.
What's your current assessment of the global economy in financial markets?
Well, it's still basically what we've espoused all year, Adam, in that I think the thing
that people can't grasp is there was so much money went into the system in '20 and '21.
It had to stream that out for a while.
Normally you would have been in a recession by now, but that really extended all of that.
Now I think the harder part, I thought by the fourth quarter we would be feeling it,
which we're starting to feel it.
And then it looks like the first and second quarter you will really feel it because we
just see so many things that are declining and this idea that the consumer is great,
we don't agree with.
I mean, if you just look at the whole thing, it's interesting to us because it's almost
like we feel like people are not reading anything.
They're just watching what's happening on TV and they just go with that.
But it's still by the month we feel like it gets a little bit worse all the time.
All right.
So what I hear you saying, Ted, we've talked about the pig and the Python metaphor of all
that stimulus that was shoved into the system in response to the pandemic.
Just sounds like that pig was way bigger than anybody expected and it's just taking a lot
longer to exit the Python.
And of course, human nature being what it is, the longer a risk people have been told
about does not manifest, they just increasingly start thinking, well, maybe it's never going
to manifest and they just start kind of going on about their lives.
Is that kind of where we are?
Well that is.
I think people forget, Adam, that five trillion was the stimulus from the government portion
of it.
And if you take that five trillion, 1.8 trillion went to individuals.
So that was free money for everybody, businesses, people, stay at home, anybody.
And then the second part is, unfortunately, the Federal Reserve, since '09, it kept the
rates so low that they really pushed this, what I call speculative activity, to an all
time, all time high.
And when that happened, that was housing, that was everything you can think of.
And so all of that, you had to push through all of that.
So it was bigger and longer than what people expected.
Okay.
I'd like to get your opinion on this.
We'll talk more about this in detail later on, but I just recently released a video with
David Rosenberg.
And he talked about not only just the size of the pig, but that now that the pig is exiting
the Python, rather than immediately constrain spending, consumers have dropped their savings
rate very substantially, relative to historic norms.
And at the same time, commensurately, they have increased the debt financing of their
lifestyle.
We've seen the credit card balances rocket higher.
And he said that that has actually sort of acted as a sort of stimulus too here.
Now, obviously, that's transitory.
That can't happen forever.
The savings rate can only go down so low and you can only charge so much in your card before
your lender cuts you off.
Do you agree with that point of view?
Oh, 100%.
I think David is right on the money on that.
And then another thing, I see this in the banking side, is that it's hard to believe
this, but people are going in and getting home equity loans.
I'm talking about at eight to 9% now, and pulling down cash out of those home equity
loans, because in most cases, they have a lot of equity in the house, and so they're
doing the home.
That part of it's going up too, which is crazy in itself, but it's all leverage.
And he's correct about that.
And we used to see home equity withdrawals as a sign of a frothy economy, where people
were just feeling good and they didn't feel bad about taking on the additional debt.
And of course, that debt was really cheap back in the last part of the cycle when they
were taking it out.
This time, is it a sign of maybe desperation where they don't have any other alternatives,
but to tap the now quite expensive equity in their house?
That's true, Adam.
And what happens is people have to be in a position where if you own any kind of real
estate at all after 2020, then all of a sudden, you've got this two or three year huge bump
in it.
And so you can't sell it or nobody will buy it.
So people are like, that's one area I know we've got money in, so I'm just going to pull
some of it out of it because we need it.
And I've just seen that all over the place.
Okay, I do want to get into your thoughts on the housing market later on here, too,
but let's go back up to the top here.
So you gave us your general view of the markets.
I guess maybe one quick question for you.
Not that long ago, so I've interviewed a number of people recently who I think share your
pessimism for next year.
David Rosenberg, like I mentioned, Fred Hickey feels the same way.
He actually believes that part of it's going to be driven by the Magnificent Seven, which
have powered the markets higher, finally stumbling here.
But highly respected technical analyst, Tom McClellan, he basically put 2024 as the years
the wheels come off.
I mean, he's really pretty bearish about this.
Are you expecting 2024 to be a more painful year for the markets and for investors than
2023 has been?
You know, Adam, I felt all along that this bear market, I still call it a bear market
that started in January '22, would be much like 2000 to '03 because we had such a huge
buildup of speculative activity for '95 to 2000.
So it took three years, actually, till March of '03 to turn it finally.
I felt like we would do the same.
We'll be basically two years into it come January '24.
And so I feel like the worst part of any sell off is always the last part.
That's where they take everybody apart.
They take the generals and they take the sergeants.
And so I think that's what you have in front of you here.
And everybody's piled into the same equity.
So that's where the damage will probably come as well.
But I think the worst part will be ahead of us here over the next one or two quarters.
Okay.
And so it sounds like you're saying yes, you think 2024 is going to be a more painful market
for investors.
But it sounds like you're kind of front ending the pain.
You're kind of looking at the first half of the year is where maybe the carnage gets real
visible.
Yeah.
We were wrong.
We thought we would be weakening quite a bit by the fourth quarter.
And I think what's happened, much like what we've been talking about, you've been able
to extend a lot of things with money and that sort of thing.
And so people were able to push through that.
I don't think the numbers will be that good for the fourth quarter in terms of GDP.
But then I think when you get into the first and second quarter, that's where you'll have
the trouble.
And I think that's where people will finally realize, "Hey, this thing's not too great
right now."
You haven't gotten a point yet where people said, "I want out on the market."
There's been no, what we've seen, no true capitulation.
Well, absolutely.
You and I have talked in past interviews about what capitulation looks like, and actually
I'll ask you to remind folks of that in a bit.
But not only have we not seen capitulation, but I would say we've seen more, at least
in parts of the market, the parts that have driven the indices, maybe not a euphoria.
I mean, I guess you could maybe say that in the AI space earlier this year, but we've
definitely seen a lot of optimism come back in.
I've talked with, again, a number of analysts on this program relatively recently, Darius
Dale being one of the ones that comes to mind, who history shows that basically stocks perform
really well right up into a recession.
And in Darius's analysis, he says the party gets kind of at its most crazy right before
the cops show up.
And I'm giving this as context because I want to put this chart up here.
This is a chart from your chief investment officers, Chance Finucane's recent update.
And he shares here that the Magnificent Seven stocks, I mean, they've done phenomenally
well this year, up on average 81% or so.
In fact, I think this chart was created before the recent pop we've had post October CPI,
so they might even be upping a little bit more.
And you can see here, they've dragged the S&P up.
And if you basically look at the S&P on an equal weight basis, well, gosh, it's negative
for the year.
Yeah.
It's probably closer to 100% now with this last little fling we had here in the last
few weeks.
It reminds me of July of this year, same thing.
They ran them up into July and everybody was really getting in the speculative mood again.
And so we're back to that.
All right.
So again, it feels, going back to Darius's point, the party's going on strong.
At least it's going on strong in tech.
And that's what matters right now in terms of propping the markets up and everything.
So to your point, the Magnificent Seven, I guess you would call them generals.
So as you said earlier, in a capitulation phase, the generals get shot along with the
infantrymen.
So are you expecting those guys to truly stumble next year?
Well I do because it was the same thing for us back in '99 and going into the first quarter
of 2000.
All of those primary stocks, and I wrote a piece in January of 2000, said these 15 companies
are really overvalued.
And I would say I went back and look at that around 2011 or '12 and all but one of them
had never gotten back where they were.
And we really feel like it's sort of the same way now.
When you get in these bubbles like this and everybody's jammed into the same thing, you
know that's going to be a problem eventually because you can't have everybody all of a
sudden say, "Oh, the holy grail are these seven stocks," and you buy those and forget
it and that usually is setting you up for some disaster down there somewhere.
I don't know where, but it's somewhere.
All right.
Well, there are two charts I want to show that hammer that home.
One here, again, a chart from Chance's presentation, which is probably now at an even higher PE
ratio than this, but this shows you how much of an outlier the magnificent seven are versus
the rest of the market and just implied fair value for the market.
I mean this is crazy.
Well it is and if you look, I don't have a chart in front of you, but I have it that
shows that if you take this tech, which is really this group drives the tech averages,
is the highest percentage relative to the S&P 500 that it has ever been in the history
of keeping the numbers.
And I think that's where people are a bit confused.
It was the internet back in the late '90s.
If you had anything to do with the internet, if you put .com on the back of your company,
you were going to get a lot of valuation and that's where we are today with this group.
Okay, I'm going to pull up a chart here that, again, you guys have done that speaks directly
to that, which is you basically said that the magnificent leaders of each decade tend
not to be the magnificent leaders in the following eras.
And I believe Chant said that we're about 15 years into this tech cycle here, meaning
that it's quite long in the tooth.
And you can see here looking at each one of these sort of prior decades, the big assets
that were driving valuation were not the ones that continued into the following decades.
So I guess you're saying, look, history is highly likely to repeat itself here.
Well, I'll just give you some examples.
If you look at 1989, 1988, '89, we would almost get thrown out of people's offices because
we didn't own Japan, but they were really expensive.
Japanese stocks were very high multiples and we just didn't own it.
We said, it's not for us.
And so in fact, that looked like the next 30 years and it did do this that wasn't ever
going to make it.
And then we had, it came back in the '90s, like the NASDAQ, especially '95 to 2000.
And that was that same sort of thing.
And I've done a lot of studies on looking at these periods when you go through, you'll
have 20 year periods, 15, 20 year periods for finance.
And then you'll have normal cycles.
You'll have maybe 12, 15 year periods of commodities and that sort of thing.
Well, commodities haven't played in so long that people have totally forgotten about them.
So there's a lot of things could change in this decade and I felt all along that this
decade would be a lot like the '70s.
You would do up and down, up and down and really not get anywhere because we were so
overpriced.
Okay.
And obviously when you say this decade, you're talking about the 2020s, right?
I am, 20, basically 2020 to 2030.
All right.
There's one or two other charts I want to pull up here real quickly.
And one is, it's another chart from David Rosenberg, got one or two others from him
too.
And I don't mean to turn this into a David Rosenberg fest, but everything you keep saying
is reminding me of these discussions I just had with him.
I have to tell you, I'll plug David too.
I take his research on an institutional basis and David's very good.
But I was going to say, it is good company to be included within.
Here's a simple chart, but I think an effective one, again, this goes back to sort of the
repeating of history, which is if you look at all the major recessions that we've had
in the past 30 plus years, they have followed a rate hiking regime where we then plateaued
for a while, right?
Where they stopped hiking rates.
And then in general, it's right when they start cutting the rates is when the recession
arrives, right?
And as you can see from here, TBD, whether we're at the peak now, we're at the plateau,
but it's been four months, I think, since the last rate hike.
And David Rosenberg is saying, history shows that once you have five consecutive months
of no rate hikes, he said, that's when the rate hiking cycle is over, right?
So he believes that we're pretty much there.
So if history is to repeat itself, there should be a recessionary shading to this chart in
the coming year.
Well, it's interesting about this chart too, and I've told people this, they didn't really
believe me, but I said back in '07 and '08, what broke the market was the 5% level on
a rate and we're exactly the same place today, except we have a ton more debt in the system
and if you look back at the left side of that graph, 1987, what broke the market was a situation
where Greenspan moved the rates such that you could get a 10% yield on five to 10-year
paper.
It didn't last long, stayed about a week, seven or eight days, and people basically
said, hey, if I can get that kind of money, I'm out of here.
And so it rolled over and then it killed the market.
And I think that's a little of what you're seeing today, people are saying, hey, I can
get five, five and a half by not doing a lot right now.
So that changes the system quite a bit.
Okay.
Well, there's one last chart of David's that I want to show while I'm on a Rosenberg roll
here, if you will.
And this again was included in Chance's presentation there.
He's got a relatively simple, but I think compelling equity momentum model and its current
reading is god awful.
So I think he says that anything above six indicates positive momentum between four and
six is neutral and less than four is negative momentum and we're coming in at a 1.2.
What's happened with the S&P, if you look at these things here that you're showing,
they keep flirting with really breaking through a lot of this stuff.
I mean, I think if I had to guess, I think that 4400 level is probably going to trigger
a lot of stuff.
Just to guess is that's where a lot of these technicians sort of plug in their number.
But if you look at the forward earnings, particularly forward guidance, forget about, in the earnings
themselves, they play this game on Wall Street where they'll make sure they beat the number
because they lower the number, but on the guidance is where you really see it.
Are they guiding down?
Yes.
You're starting to see that.
Are triple C defaults going higher?
Yes.
Quite a bit, by the way, as far as that goes.
And so if you look at all of those things to put them together, that's what we see.
And so I think you have to factor that in.
And probably the worst of, I would say, the problems are probably in private credit.
And you can't even-- like if you look at mezzanine financing rates out there right now, they're
high.
I mean, you're talking about 14 or 15 points in many cases.
And that's tough.
Well, and in the private debt market, Ted, I'm assuming we don't have the same visibility
into that market that we have into the public debt markets.
So how do we know when there's trouble there?
Is it basically when rates go high and then all of a sudden we just see a lot of bankruptcies
and defaults?
Do we get much warning before the carnage starts really happening?
Well, probably not.
And what will happen when it happens is you'll show up and it'll be like what we're seeing
with some of the commercial real estate now.
They'll go back and say, OK, here's the problem we have.
Back to investors and say, if we want to keep this company, if we want to keep it, we're
going to have to have a cash call.
And if you don't want to do the cash call, you probably don't participate.
But I think when you start seeing that kind of thing, which we're seeing in commercial
real estate right now, then you know you're in trouble.
And I think that's what's going to happen in private equity.
You have way too many, I hate to say this, but way too many 30-year-olds in private equity
firms that probably don't have a clue to what really, really bad times look like.
Well, they don't probably because they haven't lived through them.
No, they haven't.
That's one of the problems with the industry today, our industry.
We have very, very few people-- if you've been around in the industry 30 years or longer,
you've never even seen rates go higher.
Well, you know, again, I was talking about this with David Rosenberg.
He was basically saying what I've observed, which is sort of like the older and more experienced
the analyst, the more pessimistic they are about the near-term future.
And he's basically making an observation that it's the guys with all the experience who
have seen these cycles before and know what happens and know what they look like and know
what to look for.
They're very worried where the younger people in the industry who don't have that kind of
background are sort of saying, "Okay, boomer, whatever," but we think it's different this
time.
Well, and just take a point in case.
Take Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway.
He now has, he's sold things during the quarter, he's up to $157 billion in cash on the books.
And about 78% or 80% of the portfolios in five or six companies, that's it.
And that tells me that they don't have anything to buy or they would have already bought it.
People need to watch those sorts of things because those are the kinds of people that
come in that, if you remember, you saw Buffett at the end of '08, early '09, throwing out
these $10 billion investments and that's how they make a lot of money, but right now they
have a lot of cash.
And so word to the wise, what's what these people do that have been really good at it?
Yeah.
And I think one thing about Buffett that's important to note is he's got a lot of incentive
to buy something that he's maybe not 100% convinced of because he didn't have a lot
of time left.
If he wants to do something remaining in his life, he doesn't have a lot of time to do
it.
So the fact that he's still sitting on his hands, given that pressure, really tells you
that he's not finding a lot of good prospects out there.
Well it's like my wife's dad has just turned 90 and he bought a brand new, big Ford pickup.
And I always think, I tell her, I said, "He's optimistic.
What can I tell you?
That's great."
And I think Buffett's the same way.
Got it.
All right.
Well, look, I just got to ask this question because you mentioned Buffett and only owning
a couple of companies.
One of the companies he does own a lot of is Apple.
And Apple is one of these generals that we just talked about, may get taken out to the
woodshed next year.
Fred Hickey, who is famous for his newsletter that he's been writing since the 80s, the
high-tech strategist, is very pessimistic on the Magnificent Seven right now, but particularly
pessimistic on Apple and Tesla.
But on Apple, and Apple has had what, four or five consecutive quarters of revenue contraction?
I mean, part of me has a hard time squaring that circle that Buffett would be holding
on to a company that can't grow revenues.
Well I think he's probably been influenced by a couple of the lieutenants, if I had to
guess now.
I don't know the man and certainly have a lot of respect for him, but perhaps that's
the way it's been.
Here's the thing, when you would get a company this big, 3 trillion, it's really hard to
move the needle.
I mean, what are you going to do, introduce another iPhone, not that everybody else already
has an iPhone.
And one of the things, since Steve Jobs is not there, is they don't have, they bring
these really innovative, major changes out anymore.
And so, again, I look at it like Sony in 1996, $155 a share, but the 99, and there was nothing
that anybody had that wasn't Sony.
And I have people all over the country tell me, there will never be another Sony.
And that was, like so many things, not true.
So we'll get in near the end here, sort of how you're positioning and really positioning
more for the newer term, how to get through 2024.
But I'm curious, because we brought it up here, is there a sector that you're beginning
to sense might be the next big mega trend for the 2030s or whatever?
Once tech's dominance does slip, is it becoming clear to you which sector may replace it here?
Well, I'm always asking this question of myself and also the people in the firm, and everybody
had a chance and we do the same thing, which is, what are we missing?
Like we try to take a contra idea to what we're thinking to say, what would be different
than nobody's really starting to see?
And one of the things that could be different now, I'm not saying it's happening this second,
but one of the things that could be different is that commodities and commodity based companies
do really well in the next 10 or 15 years because we've basically shrunk supplies of
all these things, metals, oil, everything, the supplies of those have gone down because
we've gone toward finance and gone toward tech.
And so a lot of commodities really are in somewhat short supply and I think that's something
I'm watching.
I'm not saying it's going to happen, but it could happen.
And of course, the next thing that will happen is we'll be on the look for really, really
strong industrials because once you have a breakdown in the marketplace, the first thing
to come out of it are the really, really good industrials.
Right now is not the time and if you notice them, they're faltering, but there will be
a time.
But as far as a new technology, I don't necessarily think it would be AI that everybody thinks
about because AI is just like the internet was back in the late 90s.
Everybody puts an AI at the end because they don't know anything else to do.
Like I've got to talk about AI to make sure I'm in the club.
But the club, the real club for AI is probably very, very small and there'll be people that
make money off of it that we probably at this time don't even know what they're doing, but
that's the kind of thing we start to look for, really changing items, changing technology
and I do think that will be a big part of it.
Okay.
All right.
Well, look, we talked about stocks.
Your outlook is not positive, looking like you're looking for the correction to at least
begin if not maybe the majority of it to happen in the first half of next year.
And obviously, Ted, you're welcome to come back on this channel anytime you like.
If your crystal ball is changing, let's talk about bonds for a moment.
First let's talk about debt and then let's talk about bonds.
I know you're quite worried about both the absolute levels of debt in the American economy
and in major world economies in general.
But I also believe from what I've heard and read from your work recently is that you're
quite concerned about the wave of maturing debt that corporate America has in front of
it, where as long as interest rates remain in the same vicinity that they are right now,
we have an awful lot of debt over the next couple of years that when it re-rates will
re-rate at rates that are basically more than double than what the current debt on the corporate
balance sheets are.
Well, I mentioned this last week in a visit with someone that if you just took all of
the US debt on take debt as a starter, the average cost on it is about 2.6%.
However, 47% of that debt comes due in '24 and '25.
So if nothing changes, you're almost going to double the cost of that 47%.
That's half the debt, let's face it.
And I've said all along that Janet Yellen should be chastised for not taking our debt
and booking it out at one and a half points when she had a chance.
It passed on that.
But the biggest problem here is the rollover.
And we're finding that now with real estate, everything that's rolling over that has to
refinance right now is having trouble.
We really see it in multifamily.
And so that's going to happen with corporations too.
Fortunately for a lot of corporations though, they did book long debt for a little money.
So that part of it is not quite as bad, I think it is for the government and probably
private business, but they'll have some trouble.
The biggest trouble we have too is that you have a lot of high yield debt, a lot of it
that's not in the public market now, it's in the private market and all of that is still
yet to see the trouble, but that will be trouble.
All right.
I want to get into how you define trouble in the debt market there real quick.
So you said corporations, smartly, loaded up on the lowest cost that they could find
when the opportunity was there.
And that's what's helping a lot of these sort of zombie companies still continue to live,
even though we're now kind of getting two years into this down cycle.
But you said we didn't do that on the government level and you said that Janet Yellen didn't
take advantage of that opportunity.
Was there logic behind not taking advantage of it, or would this go down as just sort
of like a massive bungle?
Well I think that whole thing was really, unfortunately, it was probably some of the
worst decisions that have been made in the country, not only in the treasury, but in
the Fed.
For them to keep rates at a quarter of a point when they didn't need to be, and they all
got caught up in controlling the economy, I think it was an ego thing.
We can keep this thing going, which they did with this low interest rate barrier.
No, but it was like we had all these academics that had no idea what's going to happen or
go on in the street.
And it was the federal government and Yellen was a big part of that, and in addition to
all the Fed chairman, including her.
And they just got caught up in this idea that the Fed can control the economy and it can
on a short term basis, but later on, it comes knocking.
And I think that's what they ran into and realized that, "Oh goodness, we probably shouldn't
have done that."
Yeah, I just feel like we're going to be talking about a lot of those bad decisions for many
years to come here as the repercussions continue to hit us.
And I guess while we're on this topic, I should ask you about my favorite topic, which is
the lag effect.
And I think I know what your answer is going to be.
But we've had a tremendous amount of policy change where the Fed took the interest rates
from those ridiculous lows up to five, five and a half percent now, faster than they've
ever hiked before in history.
And people were worried that that was going to have an impact on the economy.
They haven't really seen it that much yet, so they're beginning to discount it.
This is why we get talks of soft landing, no landing, et cetera.
I know you've already said that the market is you expect that to kind of roll over first
half of next year, but is the lag effect still real?
Is it still going to matter?
And how much of it do you think lies ahead of us?
Well, I think more than people expect.
Normally at the end of these things is where you have the worst damage.
That's where you have people think that, you know what, I heard it was coming and I thought
it was, but nothing, I never saw anything, but now it's here and I wish I'd done something
about it.
It's sort of that idea when you get there.
And this lag effect's bigger because you had more money in the system.
And so people have been able to think more positively about things.
Their home prices are up and their stocks have stayed up to a degree.
And so that's the mode they're in.
And so the lag effect will catch a lot of people by surprise, I think.
And unfortunately, I think a lot of people will have some damage they don't need, especially
for older people.
Yeah, that's a whole different topic.
Maybe I'll reserve some time to talk about that if we can.
Well, look, so you've talked about your concerns about the debt and the impact of the debt.
But if the Fed is at this point where maybe we're now at that plateau, where it's perhaps
stopped hiking interest rates, and maybe if you think it's going to hike a little bit
more, my guess is you probably don't think it's going to hike all that much more on a
relative basis.
So if we do get to a plateau, then the more likely direction after that is cutting.
And cutting could come because the Fed achieves its objective, it gets inflation down below
2%, or cutting could come because things really start to get out of hand and the Fed has to
go into rescue mode.
Two combined questions for you, one is, which do you think is more likely, the Fed cutting
because it achieves its mission or because something breaks?
And then secondly, what is your outlook for bonds going forward from here?
There's a school of thought, I've interviewed a number of people recently, Rosenberg again
was one of them, who thinks that this is actually a really attractive time to be in longer bonds
to ride as rates come down, the seesaw relationship between rates and prices, that bond prices
should go up and that effect obviously has felt more the longer you go out on the duration
curve.
Well, I'd have to say that somewhere the rates do go down.
The idea that they think they're not coming down, they eventually roll over.
I actually have to look at it and just tell you this, in looking at history, I never believed
any of the Fed presidents before Volcker, he was the only one I ever believed, and then
I've never believed any of them since that time.
So whatever they tell me, I know that they can change immediately and not really think
about the consequences.
So I'm assuming that once you have pain of some kind, which is going to be unemployment,
it could be a severe market correction, anything that causes a lot of pain, I think they will
immediately switch gears and you won't even hear about 2%, got to get to the 2% level.
I think when you have pain and there's a lot of pressure on the pain, you have an election
year or two, remember, that I think they could fold up on you really quickly.
So I have no idea what they'll do, but whatever they do, I think will be something that they've
waited too long on, which is what they do both ways.
Which is the Fed's track record as being a slow follower, right?
I mean, the idea that they'll get back to 2% inflation is probably not going to work,
in my opinion.
And if it does work, then we probably have bigger problems than we're thinking right
now, but we'll see.
Because of the deflation is taking over, we'd have a lot less inflation than we want because
deflation is now in the driver's seat.
Well, that's part of it.
I mean, you're not inflating it all that much right now, but your Fed funds are full 2%
over the inflation rate right now, which is wild because you don't see that very often.
But I almost think you have to have some inflation more than we've ever experienced just to get
out from under the federal debt, the federal debt itself.
I mean, if you don't have inflation, you will get to a breaking point with the federal government.
So let's talk about that for a moment.
A lot of people, I've heard that sentiment before, and I agree with it, which is that
the government secretly wants a certain amount of inflation because it helps manage the cost
of the debt, right?
But too much inflation and things start breaking.
We have a gargantuan amount of debt relative to what we just had, as you said when we were
looking at that chart, like back in '08, right?
I mean, I think the government debt has more than tripled since then.
So yes, you need to have an argument.
You need to have inflation to help make that debt serviceable, more serviceable.
But at the same time, with a highly leveraged economy, highly-levered households, when the
cost of living starts going up due to inflation, our populace, I think, is having a narrowing
and narrowing band in which it can actually function without people really falling into
not being able to keep up.
So how do you sort of square that going forward?
I mean, I guess there's a scenario where they perfectly glide past it and surgically engineer
just enough inflation to keep the debt under control but enough of the populace happy.
But we're talking about guys here that we've already given many examples of are not skilled
surgeons.
So is this sort of just a recipe for some big crisis down the road?
Well I'll tell you what it looks like to me.
If you looked at the end of World War II, '45 and '46, you had roughly the same amount
of debt relative to GDP that we have today in the federal government, 375%.
And what happened is you spent the better part really of 30 years, more and more and
more and more inflation.
So by the time you got into the late 60s and the 70s, that inflation kept building, building,
building.
But what it was doing was all the debt that had been issued was shrinking that debt relative
to nominal GDP.
Because we had this production manufacturing miracle where we were the folks that helped
the rest of the world rebuild.
We don't have that this time.
So that's what I'm saying.
So this time it may be a situation where, I have no idea what it will be, but I think
it may be a situation where you need to be balanced.
I'll say that because you need some short paper because if we do stay in this inflation
era, you have to have paper that's, in our opinion, you have to have a lot of it that's
less than 60 months because you have to wait it out.
And you can't wait out 25 and 30 year paper.
I mean, most people can't.
But we've had such damage in it, Adam, already.
If you look, if you bought, if you had a long-term bond in January of '21, I mean, you're down
45 or 50% on it, maybe more.
And that's like a stock return.
And now those people that own those and those bond funds like that, you just think about
it, they've got to make, they've got to make 100% in a bond fund or a bond to get back
to break even, which is going to be tough.
I don't want to see it, but that's where we are.
Okay.
So we've, it looks very likely that 2023 will end in an unprecedented third consecutive
down year for US Treasuries.
Given your forecast for next year, what are the odds of a fourth down year?
I would say they were pretty slim in a lot of ways, because when you get down to this
point, okay, you've taken a lot out of the bond market, taken a lot of people out.
They keep, it's interesting, individuals keep buying into it all the way down, and maybe
the damage goes on a little bit longer.
But I wouldn't think so, because if you get market weakness and you get economic weakness,
you're going to get strength in the bond market, because they'll go to the Treasury market,
always do.
So that would be what I would be thinking, that those two would go hand in hand, that
you'll have weakness on one side will give you some strength in the bond market on the
other side.
And it's always interesting to me, I always jot down what I'm thinking for the next year,
and I'm normally wrong.
If I just, one of my thoughts for the first week in January, okay, I don't trade that
way or invest that way, I just get to thinking, okay, what could happen this year, what's
going to happen, and we're all anchored in what's been going on, and that's the problem.
It's hard for people to say, I wonder what could change that, and we're always asking
that question.
But what would change it are bad times.
You get into bad times, and the rates are not going to stay where they are.
People will flock to the Treasury.
Well, it's interesting.
So you're talking about sort of a safety trade, which happens in market corrections.
But then earlier, you also talked about the fact that if something big enough breaks,
the Fed has to enter as a white knight, and that's been maybe the most salient factor
in the bond market, which is that the biggest buyer of Treasuries over the past bunch of
decades has been out of the game for the past two years.
So I presume that there's good odds of a safety trade like you're talking about, but then
you have this additional potentially big optionality value of, hey, if the biggest buyer returns
to the Treasury market, that's probably going to help too.
Well, if you look at it from foreign countries buying, that's been declining now for two
years in a row.
They keep on buying less and less and less.
People will say, well, we want to have a buyer, and I always want to say to them, well, don't
discount the federal government, because back in World War II, you had to buy the bonds.
You couldn't own your gold.
And so I'm always thinking, well, what could they do?
Well, I could say, well, if you have a pension plan or an IRA, you have to own 30% US bonds,
and then problem solved.
There's all kinds of things they can do if you want to keep it tax free, that is.
There's all kinds of things the Fed can do.
I didn't ever put anything past them.
So I just think that people today need to really have their head on straight to make
sure they've got a pretty good balance of things so that they can get through things,
not be all in on just one thing.
All right.
Well, that's a great segue to a question I've been building up to, which is, well, then
how are you positioning right now for your clients?
What are the main themes from your portfolio positioning?
Well, I'll take the stock side first.
People, they tweet out or they give us a hard time and say, well, you're not in the market.
And I always want to say, well, we are in the market.
Just because we have 55% or more liquid in a stock account or 60 doesn't mean we don't
own stocks.
And interestingly enough, see, we have some of those names you mentioned, we've cut back
on them.
We have Apple of 12, 14 years, Microsoft 15 years ago, but we've cut back on them.
And brand new accounts that come in on the stock side, we don't buy those companies.
We've cut back on those legacy positions and we buy more consumer staples.
But my point is this, if we can get, which we have this year, if we can get two thirds
of the S&P return with 55% or 60% liquid, we win.
That's the way I look at it anyway.
And I think that's where we are today.
So our investors are happy with that because we have a lot of liquidity in the treasury.
On the very conservative side, we only have three strategies.
That is another one that's about 65% treasury, short term.
And then we've got some that when I say short term, I'm seeing less than a year.
Then we have a big part of that, that's one, two, three year.
And we have about 10 or 12% that's longterm, 20 to 30 year, obviously it's down in price.
But what's offset it, what's offset it is the fact that we're getting so much more money
on the short end.
And we started now seeing some really great tax free bonds that are, when you do the math
on them, that are out in 24, 25, 26, 27, they're a better return than the taxable treasury
side.
So that's where we are on the really, really conservative piece.
And then we have a group called a high income and it's been a tougher year for high income
because anything that had income on the end of it got hurt this year.
And you can take it down the list, preferreds, real estate investment trusts, the only thing
that really did not in that group were really the gas pipelines that we own.
They fare really well this year.
But even in that high income account, we're still 60% or more in the treasury.
We'll come back to a lot of those things.
I mean, we really got stopped out of some of the REITs that we had last year during
this year.
And we've moved some of the preferreds around.
We just think that there'll be some really-- we're starting to see some really good companies
that have a dividend that's really high now.
They can keep it.
We think a lot of them can.
Those are the companies that we're going to-- in that high income strategy, we'll flock
to those in the 24 year because if you can buy a good company that does well under most
circumstances, maybe they're having some trouble right now and times are soft, but they're
a real good company, not over indebted, and they'll pay you 6% or 7% on the dividend,
you think about it.
That's a 20% tax on that.
And you've got a growth element to it.
That's a good investment.
And that's what we'll be looking for.
And I know your answer will really depend on how things develop on the ground next year,
but it sounds like from what I'm hearing from you is that you have kept a really big liquidity
buffer over the past year plus, given your current macro assessment, which is there--
maybe back to your Buffett story-- that's there to be deployed when you see better valuations
ahead.
It sounds like you think that there could be a pretty big event, corrective event in
the markets the first half of next year.
So my guess is you're probably assuming that you're going to have a lower cash percentage
next year because you will be deploying that liquidity if indeed prices come down to a
place where you feel like the valuations give you the green light to start buying.
Well, that's true.
If you look for us, it's not that we're all that bright, but we always do the best off
of the bottom of the market.
In other words, if we look at '09, '03, even 1988, those are times when we had a lot of
liquidity.
And people don't realize, but we look at that as-- we don't look at it as bad times.
We look at it as opportunity.
And that's-- if you have a lot of liquidity after you go through a cycle and you get to
the other side, that first two or three years off of that low where you invested, you will
make-- that's where you'll make a lot of money for that 10-year run.
And we don't do as well when things are just-- everybody's really speculative because we
just won't play in the market like that.
That's just not something we do.
So we cut back.
And we'd rather be in a position where we feel like at least we're in enough-- there's
going to be things happen this next 10 years.
There'll be one or two things happen that none of us will expect.
Nobody will expect it.
It always happens this way.
You don't know what it is, but you know there's something.
And if you don't have the ability to wade through that with enough liquidity where you
can take advantage of some things that happen, then you really-- you're not stewarding the
money well enough.
We really feel like you need to be able to get through those things.
All right.
Well, they say in investing you make your money when you buy, not when you sell because
you're buying at a good valuation that the odds are in your favor will eventually appreciate.
So I don't want to put words in your mouth here, but I think maybe what I hear you saying
is, look, markets give you at certain times an opportunity to buy in at great valuations
that you can then ride for like a decade in certain cases.
And it doesn't give you those opportunities every year.
And I kind of hear you saying things are aligning where the probability of next year potentially
being one of those years is maybe better than normal.
Now there's going to be a lot of pain and carnage we're going to have to get through
before the buying moment occurs.
But next year could be, in your estimation, one of those years where you can get some
of those great buying opportunities that don't come along very often.
Well, I think what will happen with people too is they look at people that index and
do all those sorts of things, they'll look up and they'll say, these indexers are the
highest point late December, early January of 21 and late December 2020 and early 21.
And then it lasted all the way through to the very end.
So December of 21 was the highest point, you know, and that was a great year for them.
And I think they thought maybe we're back in the money.
Well, the problem is, I think they'll look up after two and a half or three years and
say, gosh, I really haven't made any money.
We were X amount then and we're still 15, 10, 15% below, or maybe you might be 30 or
40% below.
And that's what makes people throw in the towel.
They're like, I can't win here, I'm three years into it, not making any money, so I'm
just going to sell it, which is the worst thing to do at the wrong time.
And that's how you finish these things.
The worst part comes at the end, I can tell you that.
People don't realize that, but that last 25 or 35% of a bear market is where they get
everybody.
And you've been saying this many of the times you've been on this program, Ted, and all
through 2022, when the markets were going down, you kept saying, I'm not seeing that
type of capitulation yet.
And we didn't have it, and of course, markets rebounded here in 2023.
If we get to the point in which you are starting to see that type of washout, that type of
capitulation, please let me know and we'll have you back on so that you can tell people,
okay, I'm finally seeing this.
Well, I'll tell you when we start buying, I mean, we usually, I'll give you a really
good story.
We had a lot of cash in '08, about probably 45% or something.
We put in the market, I'll just use the Dow, it came down about, it was 14.7 in October
of '07.
By the time we got to December, November to December, it came down about 8,800.
And that's a big move.
So what's typical of us, we put in about half our cash.
And then by the time we got to the last week in February of '09, it was early March, it
was 6,500.
No, we went down another 25%.
So what do we do?
Things were so cheap then, we put in more money.
I think we only had about three or 4% cash at that point after we did that.
Well, that turned into, if you look at both of those, okay, you can say, well, you were
too early.
Yeah, we were, but they were cheap.
They were cheap.
They were cheap at 8,800.
They were cheap at 7,500 and certainly cheap at 6,500.
And so if you looked at those buys over the next period from all the way through, they
were really good buys and that's where it makes you a lot of money.
All right.
Well, look Ted, in wrapping up here, whenever I interview you, we wax philosophical a little
bit near the end and in the comments, I hear that that's what people enjoy most when you're
on the program is benefiting not just from your market intelligence, but just sort of
from your general life perspective as a very successful financial advisor to a lot of clients
who have made a lot of money over the course of their careers, both by investing it, but
many of your clients were entrepreneurs, business creators, whatnot.
So you've got a really close finger on the pulse of what makes people wealthy and what
I want to underscore about the word wealthy there is because I know you, wealth to you
isn't just the number of digits in your investment portfolio.
It's a whole bunch of other things that really equate more to happiness and fulfillment and
that money doesn't always necessarily equal happiness.
And so a couple of quick closing question for you.
They say money doesn't buy happiness and it is no guarantee of such.
You deal with high net worth families.
What are the biggest obstacles that get in their way?
My wife's a therapist and she has a lot of clients from Silicon Valley who are very wealthy,
but also very unhappy at the same time.
I imagine that you see families as well that have all the ingredients to be happy, but
aren't.
What gets in their way?
Well, a few things get in their way.
Number one, they think that things will make them happy and things never make you happy
because if you get a lot of things, well, that didn't make me happy enough, so I want
some more things.
And if I get bigger cars than somebody else or some bigger houses or bigger planes, then
that will make me happy.
But happiness comes from within.
And I have people that only have $2 million, they're the happiest people in the world because
they're happy internally.
And I've always said to people and a lot of things, and I'm not in the therapy business
like your wife, but I've always told people that, "Hey, if you're not happy, you need
to think about it."
And I've talked to people about this and about, I see married couples, for example, that are
unhappy and I always want to say to them, "Look, you know what?
You can make more money, but you can't make more happiness."
So if you stay in your situation unhappy, it's not going to change, so make the change,
whatever that change might be, and have ways of knowing what really makes you happy.
And if you really want to make yourself happy, give back to the world.
I think my happiest people that I do business with and have a lot of money, they give back
to the world.
They do so many great things for underprivileged people and causes and things that really make
a difference in the world.
And they are the happiest people, I will tell you, when you can do that.
So folks on this channel hear me talk a lot about the advice that people who live over
a hundred give.
If you go on YouTube and you type in centenarian, that's the word for someone who's lived over
a hundred, you'll find a lot of videos where people are saying, "Hey, you've done it.
You've won life.
What really matters?"
And they always say the same three things.
They say the quality of your relationships, so people are number one and we're social
creatures.
We need to respect that.
That's where we really drive the majority of our happiness.
The second to what you're talking about there, Ted, is meaning, it's purpose.
It's that my life made some difference in some way that's important to me.
And then the third is health and that's not a surprise because you can't get to a hundred
if you don't have good health.
So I hear a lot of echoes of that in what you're saying.
Now, you made a comment, I just want to underscore this for people.
You said, even people who have as little as $2 million can be very happy.
Now, there are a lot of people watching this channel who $2 million sounds like it's a
very aspirational destination for them.
They may not be close to that yet, but I don't think you're saying in any way at all that
not having $2 million is going to make you unhappy.
And for folks that haven't watched my previous interviews with you, you grew up, and I'll
let you describe it, but I think you grew up under extremely meager means, and I'll
let you say whatever you want to say about that.
But yeah, I guess my question is, I think everything we're talking about applies to
people who haven't yet crossed the million mark, right?
Well it's true.
And I did grow up very, very poor, not to go into a lot of detail, but a lot of people
do by the way.
And you can be poor and be unhappy, or you can be poor and be happy if you have love
in the home and that sort of thing.
And I think that makes a difference.
But I think the biggest thing with people is they forget to be grateful for whatever
they have.
I was always grateful for the little I had and the people that helped me in my life.
I'm grateful to them.
They made so much difference in my life.
And I'm grateful today.
I mean, I have a thing I do every day.
I wake up, I have a journal, but I always write at least a dozen things that I'm grateful
for every day of my life.
My wife calls that a gratitude practice, which she recommends for a lot of her clients.
You got to remember, and I try to, it's interesting.
I see really, really wealthy people, and I hate to say this, but something happens that's
unfortunate for one of their children.
And I know why.
They never took the time to really instill, hey, let's be happy.
Let's forget about having and seeing and doing and making people think we're something.
Let's love each other and be happy together, be grateful for what we have.
And I think a lot of people forget that.
And particularly people that come into wealth, I would hope they would be more grateful than
anybody, because a lot of people help you get wealth, especially if you have a company.
And I've seen people sell companies before, and they did nothing for the people that helped
them to get there.
And I always thought that was a shame.
They could have done something nice for them at the same time.
But you have to look at this and say, what makes people happy?
And it's not necessarily getting a lot more money.
All right.
That's great perspective.
And in terms of people being grateful and doing right by the people that supported them,
I will definitely owe you something very nice in the future for all the support that you
and the team of Oxbow have shown me in my journey to go independent here with this new
channel.
I've just been a great mentor and supporter for that, Ted.
And I really want to thank you and let you know that we'll pay it forward as soon as
this channel is up and running on full thrusters.
Well, I would say this, and I won't say anything else, but Adam, I'll say this about you.
You have a way, not everybody has this skill, but it's intuitive for you.
You have a way of, number one, asking great questions.
You have a number two, you have a way about you that you don't bully or anything like
that.
You really are open.
And on top of that, and I'll say this to you, because I always think about that you have
a great voice.
And so you put all those together and I don't think there's any way you won't be successful
on your new channel.
Well, thank you.
You're making me blush now.
And I should, at the same time, too, express gratitude for all the viewers, all the people
that have followed me over here to this new channel.
All the kind words of support and encouragement you guys have sent.
It has been truly wonderful.
Well, Ted, thank you so much.
And wrapping this up, for folks that would like to follow you and your work, where should
they go?
Well, the best place to go, Adam, is just the website, oxbowadvisors.com.
You'll see everything we do there, newsletters, interviews, anything that's there.
This interview will be there, too.
So anything they want to find, they'll find it there.
Books.
We've got a number of books they can order.
Right.
You get a brand new one out, right?
We do.
It's called A Balanced Portfolio.
Stay rich with a balanced portfolio.
We think that's important nowadays.
And then we have a new book coming out.
It's a rewrite, really, in the first quarter next year entitled 30 million in broke.
It's about all the eras that people make after they get a lot of money.
All right.
Well, look, Ted, when I edit this, I will put up the URL to your website here on the
screen so folks know where to go.
Folks, it'll also be linked in the description below so you can get there with one click.
