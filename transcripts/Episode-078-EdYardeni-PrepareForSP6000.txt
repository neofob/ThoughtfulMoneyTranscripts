Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
Stocks have delivered a great ride over the past year and a half.
That's attracted retail investors back into the markets with a vengeance.
World equity ownership is currently near an all-time high.
So does this bull market still have plenty of room left to run?
And if so, then what are the skeptics misunderstanding?
For insight, we've got the good fortune to turn to Dr. Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni
Research.
Ed, thanks so much for joining us today.
Thank you.
Well, Ed, I believe this is your first time on the new channel.
Thank you so much for making your inaugural appearance here.
Of course, you and I have talked many times.
Congratulations to you.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's been a great ride so far.
And the fact that Ed Yardeni has agreed to come on the program is just going to bring
us to even new heights.
Anytime really.
Well, thank you.
You might regret making that offer, but we'll run with it.
Well, I got a lot of questions for you about what's going on right now.
I do want to acknowledge in the past several times that we spoke in 2023, you remained
pretty sanguine about the outlook for the economy in the markets.
And to date, I think you've been proven quite right on that.
So first, I want to give you well-deserved props for your outlook and for sticking to
your guns.
I want to get into that and what you see lying ahead.
But real quick, if we can just start with the general question I like to kick all of
our discussions off with, what's your current assessment of the global economy in financial
markets?
Well, I think it's great that you started off asking me that question because as investors,
we tend to be too US-centric and not totally appreciate the fact that we do live in a small
world after all, as that ride in Disney sings.
And I think when you look at the global situation, what you see is that the US is doing really
quite well compared to the rest of the world.
And that's important because that has an impact on the dollar, it has an impact on commodity
prices.
Usually, when the US is doing better than the rest of the world, the dollar doesn't
go down, it stays stable or it goes higher.
The other thing is China is not doing well at all.
China over the past couple of years has gotten into a deeper and deeper depression in their
property market, their property bubble burst.
You know, a lot of Chinese people are big savers and they buy stocks.
They also bought a lot of apartments and they had so-called ghost cities of these apartments
were basically vacant.
They weren't even rented out and they viewed that as a part of their wealth and now they've
got this huge negative so-called wealth effect where both their stock portfolios and their
property portfolios are down.
So that's depressing consumer spending in China.
And as a result of that, the Chinese government has tried to stimulate consumer spending,
can't seem to get it going.
So they are continuing to push the old model of manufacturing for export and that's creating
a lot of deflation in the global goods markets, merchandise markets.
We're seeing that, for example, in a decline in import prices from goods we buy from China
in the United States.
And so that's important for understanding why inflation has come down.
You know, a lot of people were pessimistic over the past couple of years because they
felt that the only way the Federal Reserve could possibly bring inflation down was with
a recession.
And they were right.
They just got the wrong country.
We didn't have to have one here because the Chinese did it for us and they've been a major
source of deflation in the goods market.
Services obviously is a whole different story, but the service inflation rate is also gradually
coming down.
Europe is in a shallow recession.
So when you add it all up, it's a global economy that's kind of muddling along with the US
economy chugging along.
And I mentioned the US, Europe and China, emerging markets, many of them are commodity
producers like Brazil, for example, Indonesia, another example.
And in that kind of global, relatively weak environment, commodity prices are probably
going to remain relatively depressed, relatively low.
And that also contributes to a weakness in the global economy.
OK, so US chugging along, rest of world kind of muddling along.
It sounds like you're saying we got the recession we were looking for to bring down inflation.
We were just able to kind of put that monkey on someone else's back, right?
Correct.
Yeah, absolutely.
Do you think the US has dodged the bullet here?
Or is there a piper to be paid in the future or did we literally sort of manage to amend
this?
Well, as you probably know, I am biased to being an optimist and maybe it's because I
had a happy childhood.
I don't know what it is, but I think part of it is pessimism is so in fashion these
days that I try to be balanced and by trying to be balanced in an environment where so
many smart people doing so much, you know, heavy duty analysis of what could go wrong,
I find myself being labeled as the optimist, as the permeable, simply because I'm trying
to provide some balance.
So yeah, yeah, I understand all that.
I mean, we could spend the time we have left and I could bury you with how everything is
going to absolutely fall apart, but it wouldn't be anything unique or original from what maybe
some of your other guests have been saying.
So I know their story.
I think if you ask the pessimist to tell my story that they may know it, but you know,
it would be hard for them to tell it because, you know, they wouldn't believe it.
But I think that what we're looking at for the United States is an environment where
we have to understand what it is that caused recessions.
And when you look at it, the recession since 1960, what you come to realize is it's a process
that leads to a recession.
Monetary policy starts to tighten because inflation is a problem either in goods markets
and services markets and/or in an asset market.
So the Fed starts to tighten and somewhere along the way, the yield curve inverts.
The bond yield falls below the short-term rate.
That's a signal that bond investors saying, "You know what, I'm going to buy a bond at
4% even though a 10-year bond at 4%, even if I can get 5% in a two-year because if the
Fed just goes any further here, something's going to break and then they'll have to ease.
And so let's not try to be too cute about calling the exact tap when interest rates
peak.
Let's conclude that it's getting close."
And so the yield curve did in fact invert a couple of years ago and it did in fact get
it right.
We got a financial crisis just as previous yield curves have correctly anticipated.
This time it was a mini crisis in the banking sector in March of 2023.
The Fed came in with a very impressive liquidity facility.
They learned how to play whack-a-mole back during the great financial crisis.
They created one liquidity facility after the other.
It doesn't always keep us out of a credit crunch in a recession, but it certainly worked
last year.
And so we haven't had a credit crunch and therefore we haven't had a recession.
It's credit crunches that cause recessions and it's financial crisis that kind of trigger
and lead up to these credit crunches.
So I don't see a scenario like that.
Not if the Fed has learned how to play whack-a-mole in the credit markets.
In fact, I don't think that the Fed really needs to lower interest rates here.
There's a lot of people who think that the Fed needs to lower interest rates because
if they don't, that'll cause a recession.
And I think while it is true that the Fed has tightened monetary policy dramatically,
if you look at the Fed funds rate going from zero to 5.25% in a matter of two years, I
think it's also important to realize that they've actually normalized.
The abnormality is not 4% 10 year bond yield today.
It was, you know, a bond yield of 0.5% in the midst of the pandemic.
So look, I'm not going to tell you we're never going to have a recession again.
We obviously will.
I do worry about, you know, it's not just credit crunches that cause recessions.
In our lifetime, we've also seen spikes in oil prices, energy crises that cause recessions.
And that's still a possibility with the insanity going on in the Middle East.
So far, amazingly, it hasn't caused oil prices to spike up to 100 and higher.
But I have been noticing of late, as we all have, that the price of oil, the price of
gasoline has been going up for the past few months.
And I think there is a Middle East war premium in the oil market, and I hope it doesn't get
into a situation where, first of all, obviously, like everybody else, I wish that there'd be
some sort of peaceful resolution of all these crazy things that are killing so many people.
But at the same time, as an investment strategist, I have to be realistic and say that, you know,
there is a risk that this turns into another energy crisis, in which case we would probably
suffer a recession.
Okay.
So kind of what I hear you saying, Ed, is, look there, sure, there's a lot of things
that could derail the economy and enforce a market correction in here.
But you're not seeing anything that's sort of an imminent threat, and you kind of feel
like, you know, until you see something that that looks like that, it's going to be status
quo.
Well, you know, the other thing I should mention, you know, I like to compare decades.
Now, if I can get a decade right, I feel pretty good.
I guess actually if I can get a year right, I feel pretty good.
In the past couple of years, I feel pretty good, having been optimistic.
But you know, I could be wrong, it happens from time to time to everybody who's a forecaster.
And so I think there are similarities with the 1920s, and that's really my base case,
is that this will, by the end of the decade, we'll look back, you know, started out awfully
scary, but it basically turned out to be the roaring 2020s.
And the analogy is with technology and productivity, tremendous technological innovations in the
1920s.
Same thing now.
I think the stock market started to discount the roaring 2020 scenario.
I'll tell you, I have the exact date, November 30th, 2022 is when OpenAI first introduced
GATT GPT.
And there's been lots of excitement about artificial intelligence, how that could increase
productivity.
And in fact, productivity has been increasing at a better rate, had a very good year last
year.
So it could be the 2020s.
It could also be the 1970s, as we just discussed, if we have a second energy crisis, I think
that could possibly cause a recession.
And then another analogy is the 1990s in which we had a technology-led bubble in the stock
market that burst.
And then we had a recession for a while with a pretty terrible bear market for quite some
time.
And it could be that we may be seeing too much hype in AI, we may be seeing too much
money being thrown into technology, and that may set the stage for a speculative bubble
in the stock market.
If it is in the 1990s, though, I think we're closer to December 5th, 1996 than the end
of 1999, December 5th, 1996 is when Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan famously asked
the question.
He didn't say, he just asked the question, how do we know if we're looking at irrational
exuberance in the stock market?
I and a lot of other people are asking that right now.
Forward PE of 21 on the S&P 500 is quite high.
So we could have another scenario for a recession, and that is we have a, you know, let's party
like it's 1999, you know, Prince's famous song.
And if we do that, and we see a melt up in the stock market, then we'd have to worry
about a meltdowns and a recessionary environment.
But you know, melt ups can be a lot of fun if you remember to get out at the top.
It can be fun on the way up.
All right.
So you touched on a number of things that I want to ask you about in a little more depth.
And I'm really not, my job here is I'm not trying to ask leading questions.
I'm just trying to ask questions for you to give your perspective on.
And I appreciate it.
Sure.
I do want to get to the question at the end of this, which is, so what are the bears missing
here?
Because as you said, there are lots of different things that could happen in a number of the
decades you just mentioned didn't end well.
So I was going to get to here, but since you just mentioned it, why don't we start here?
Right.
So you're a party like it's 1999 scenario.
We have a market that has been on fire really for the past year and a half, but it kicked
into overdrive in November of last year.
I think the S&P is up over a thousand points since then, so over 25% in just the past four
and a half months.
But that rise is being driven by a dwindling number of stocks.
And it's largely being powered by the mag seven, now the mag five or four or three, depending
on who you're talking to in any given day.
Nvidia is the lead sled dog driving that and on any given day, the price to sales for that
company is somewhere between 30 and 40 times.
So you said if this was sort of like a nineties decade, you're thinking it might be closer
to 96 and end of 99, but man, when you have ratios like that, they are pretty hard to
defend intellectually and look, markets can melt ups can go super far, but how worried
are you?
I shouldn't ask that leading question.
What is your opinion right now of the valuations of the stocks driving this market and what
do you feel about the market breath as a sign of health?
I'm a reasonable person.
They're not cheap.
They were a lot cheaper a year or two years ago for sure.
And so valuations are stretched and I would point out though that the notion that it's
been a fairly narrow bull market is not quite right.
I've seen some people take the ratio of the S and P 500 equal weighted index and divided
by the S and P 500 market cap weighted index and say, look, it's going down.
The market's going up on a narrow or narrow or falling ratio.
And I point out, you know what?
It's just that a few stocks have done so incredibly well that a piddling 20% increase in some
of these other areas of the market, it looks like chump change, but it's been a bull market
pretty much across the board in the market.
There've been plenty of areas of the market that have performed extremely well, just not
like superbly well, as we've seen some of the AI related stocks.
So you take out the big cap technology names and you get a multiple of about 18, which
isn't cheap either, historically 15 seems to be the fair value of view of the marketplace.
I don't want to say it's different this time, but there are some differences and that is
I believe that the technology revolution we're experiencing now has the potential to increase
productivity in a whole host of businesses, not just a few.
The technology revolution that started out at the beginning that occurred in the 1990s
basically provided Word and Excel as software that allowed some companies to increase their
productivity in the secretarial pool.
You wouldn't need a lot of people on Selectric typewriters anymore if everybody's doing their
own documents, writing their own documents on Word.
If you had a whole bunch of bookkeepers, you could use Excel.
But other than that, there wasn't a lot of productivity impact on the rest of the economy.
This time around, I think between the cloud and between all the software programs that
are out there that do in fact allow companies to use these technologies to augment the productivity
of workers, to make them more productive, not to get rid of them, I think all that adds
up to the potential for the market to continue to do well.
I've been talking about 5,400 of the S&P 500 by the end of the year.
I've been talking about that for over a year and now I've got the problem of we're almost
there and it's the end of March basically.
I'm starting to talk about, well, yeah, but I think it's still a bull market.
There could be a correction along the way here, but there could also be a melt up along
the way here.
I mean, the market has beaten my expectations and I've been sort of on the high bullish
side for the past couple of years and the market keeps running past me to achieve my
levels by the middle of the year or earlier.
So I think it's still a bull market that can carry us for the next couple of years.
Bull markets don't just suddenly end unless there's a recession.
And again, barring a real calamity in the Middle East that leads to a spike in oil prices
which causes the recession, I don't see it.
If on the other hand, we have a melt up scenario in the market, there could be a bursting of
a speculative bubble down the road that leads to recession.
But before that happens, the market's going to go a lot higher.
Okay, and I recently saw your forecast for the S&P.
If I can just confirm them for you to make sure these are still your forecasts.
It was 5,400 for end of this year, which you just said 6,000 for year in 2025 and 6,500
for 2026.
And I know these are finger to the winds, but is that still more or less?
Yeah, I'm still sticking with that.
I mean, it conveys my basic view that I think there's not likely to be a recession.
And if that's the case, we're going to be in a bull market until there really is a recession.
I mean, we did have a bear market in 2020.
Sorry, we did have a bear market in 2020 that didn't last very long when the Fed came in.
But we also had another bear market in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine, and then everybody
started thinking about a recession.
So you can't have a bear market without a recession.
But that's very unusual.
And this time around, I think it's not likely we'll have a bear market unless there really
is a reason to anticipate a recession.
I'm going to ask you about components of the economy and where it's headed and whether
there's recessionary implications or not.
Real quick though, I guess since we're here, so you expect the markets to go up pretty
much for the next three years straight.
What asset classes and/or investing strategies do you favor given this outlook?
Do you think there are sectors that will do better than others?
Will it be kind of like the post 2010 era where just all boats rose?
Well, in this environment, I kind of like them all.
I've been recommending technology, financials, industrials as overweight positions.
I know materials have done well recently, but I don't see that the global economy is
going to be red hot and lead to higher commodity, any sort of sustainable increase in commodity
prices.
I have liked energy, which hasn't worked out very well until recently as a hedge against
the kind of geopolitical risk that still exists in the Middle East.
And so I think those would still be, and I've been promoting those for the past couple of
years and where technology has been number one, and technology includes communication
services obviously.
So I would stick with those, but the laggards like healthcare, I think you'll see some improvement
there, some catching up.
I think recently it's done better.
And I do think the small and mid cap stocks will perform better.
But so far, the problem with the SMIT caps is analysts aren't really getting that excited
about their earnings prospects, which I think is what's holding them down.
So we've got to see better action there.
One of the problems we're having is that the big technology companies and others that have
a tremendous amount of cash are buying up all the good companies before they go public.
So in the old days, startups would go to the capital markets, they go public and they turn
into Microsoft.
And these days, these little companies get bought up by Microsoft and you never see them
other than through the income statement and balance sheet of Microsoft.
So that may be part of the issue.
I'm not a big fan of looking at the Russell 2000, which is small caps because it's got
a lot of companies that have no earnings.
I much prefer the S&P 600, which is the small caps index of 600.
There's also the S&P 400 for the mid caps.
One of the hottest sectors has been actually technology in the mid cap area of the marketplace.
So I think there's still opportunities in the market.
Okay, still a lot of opportunities.
On the point you just mentioned about the big companies buying up smaller private companies,
I'd just love to get your thoughts on this observation.
I interviewed a private equity guy about a year ago and he was saying, "Look, you want
to look at private equity because sort of as you were saying, back in the old days,
if you wanted to scale, you had to go tap the public markets.
That was the only way to get that much capital.
But now the private markets are becoming so deep that you have companies out there."
He was mentioning SpaceX is a really good example.
A company that just has to spend gargantuan amount of capital before it ever gets to a
point of sustainable profitability.
He was like, "There's no way you could ever launch a company like that without tapping
the public markets in the past.
But now it's so far at least remaining private."
So his point was, the growth is increasingly going private because you don't have the hassles
of being a public corporation.
And now as you're saying, and there's a fat buyout somewhere in there too at some point.
So do you have a long term concern that the best investments are now not going to be available
to the public markets?
Yeah, I think that's what I was getting at with regards to the Smith caps is that the
real cream of the crop don't ever get to the public market.
So that is an issue.
That doesn't mean that there aren't good companies in the public sector.
But I think it is an issue and maybe that's why the large caps are going to continue to
outperform their smaller cap companies.
By the way, I would also point out, it's not just that there's more money in private capital
as more money also in distressed asset managers, which is also a form of private capital.
And that's one of the reasons I think that the US, it's a shock absorber for the United
States.
When things go really wrong in commercial real estate, somebody is going to lose a lot
of money as long as it's not a bank and it's just a portfolio in an insurance company or
somewhere else.
It's not a disaster.
And meanwhile, somebody else can pick it up for 25 cents on the dollar and they've got
the money to turn it around.
You know, I've heard of a mall in Texas that went out of business and somebody bought it
real cheap and made a pickleball facility out of it that's doing extremely well.
So Americans are, I think one of the things that America really does have that is unique
in the financial realm is a very, very well-developed capital market, private equity distressed asset
managers.
They provide a tremendous amount of liquidity to the system.
But at the end of the day, while investors may miss some opportunities that otherwise
would have occurred, you wind up investing with the companies that have the cash that
are buying up the good ideas and you'll participate to a certain extent.
You can almost look at some of these big cap names as venture funds.
They're investing in the companies for you.
Yeah.
You know, you've probably seen the same charts I have had that show that the leaders of the
Dow or the dominant indices in one decade tend to not be there, not be the leaders in
the next decade.
So there was a time when it was all banks.
There was a time when it was all energy companies.
Right now it's all tech and it feels when you're in that era like these companies are
never going to be displaced.
Do you feel like it's a little bit different this time that these companies have gotten
so big and they're now, like you said, like venture arms and are they more entrenched
now than they've been in previous decades or should we just sort of not have the hubris
that today is different?
I think it's possible that all these companies will still be around in 10, 20, 30 years.
I think Jeff Bezos famously was on 60 Minutes one time and predicted that Amazon would not
be around at some point.
I know that the head of Nvidia has said that he manages this company like it's going to
go out of business tomorrow.
And so, I mean, if you've got leaders of companies who are doing the best they can to continue
to grow and move forward and to innovate, then they'll probably continue to do that.
Some of them like Facebook are still owned or managed by their founders.
Companies where their founders are still in charge and have succeeded in making these
companies big tend to continue to have that aspiration and achieve it.
So I think there's something to be said for that.
You know, I'll say this with taking the risk that it'll be dead wrong, but I think that
all companies are technology companies now.
That means you either use it or you either make it or you use it.
You don't use it, you're going to lose it.
You're going to go out of business.
Companies have to use technology.
And again, in the 1990s, you didn't have to use technology because there wasn't a lot
that really you could use other than Word and Excel.
And that was a fairly limited use.
Now, you know, artificial intelligence didn't just come around recently.
It's been around for a while.
I would argue that, you know, Siri and Alexa are a form of artificial intelligence.
I'll be more excited about artificial intelligence when I can actually have a conversation with
these ladies and ask them to make a phone call for me or, you know, or make an appointment
for me.
That's where my kind of question of artificial intelligence comes in is that at my level,
I'm not really seeing it yet, but I think at the company level, every company that has
a lot of data that's internal, I think they're going to be able to use that data with artificial
intelligence to manage their business a lot better.
I think artificial intelligence that's kind of open ended and gets this information from
the Internet is going to get increasingly polluted with garbage that it creates itself.
You know, it'll start sourcing itself, saying, well, you know, this article is where I got
this information from and it'll turn out to be something, some article that another AI
program wrote.
So I think you have to be careful about recognizing that artificial intelligence is, it is artificial.
It's not intelligent.
And I think we're spending billions of dollars that will, in fact, lead to not more intelligent,
but less error prone AI, by the way, is a personal story.
Again, I think that artificial intelligence first got discounted or let's make it broader
that the roaring 2020s got discounted, started to be discounted back on November 30th, 2022.
That's when open AI introduced their chat GPT.
So one week later, I signed up for the $20 a month version.
A few months later, I canceled because I thought, you know, I'd be able to just have this thing
work for me and do all my work.
And so I wouldn't have to work so hard and turned out that I had to spend more time correcting
its errors.
I said, well, I might as well just write it myself.
So my personal experience hasn't been all that gung ho on AI, but I'm sure that companies
that keep the, that have huge, vast amounts of information and data will be able to use
it within their proprietary domains and get tremendous productivity gains from them.
All right.
This is so many layers of this onion I want to peel at the time.
It'll make you cry.
You know, well, first off, you've given us your targets of ever rising stocks for the
next three years.
I just want to draw a parallel between the AI-driven promise today and the promise of
the internet back in 1999, right?
And this all goes to the price is what you pay, value is what you get, right?
Yeah.
There are a lot of companies that ended up doing great, you know, perform like income
statement performance-wise, cashflow performance-wise in the several decades following 1999.
But the stock prices were just at astronomical levels back then, right?
And so, you know, it wasn't a good value, right?
And you know, that's why it took the NASDAQ so long to heal from the dot-com crash.
What's your level of concern that that may be going on today?
Well, I don't see too many dot-coms.
I mean, I don't see companies that are just harebrained IDs that attract the first round
of financing.
And then when they need the second round, the investors say, this was a harebrained
idea.
I don't know why I gave you any money in the first place and these things all blew up.
And meanwhile, with the first round of funding, they bought all these computers and software
and created the technology demand boom.
In addition, companies like Cisco and some of the other telecom companies went on a buying
binge.
They bought each other.
And a lot of the telecom companies engaged in solar financing, which is not a good long-term
strategy.
You know, you can always get somebody to buy your product if you lend them money and eventually
they wind up stiffing you.
But when they do stiff you, that's when that whole model blows up.
And then let's not forget Y2K.
There was a perception that you had to spend a lot of money on technology in order to avoid
that problem.
And that had to be a great excuse for doing just that.
And so when the millennium clock turned, guess what?
There were no problems.
By the way, back then, it was one of my most serious forecasting era.
I thought there might be a recession.
There was, but it wasn't for the reasons I thought.
It was because companies bought all the technology they wanted and then they didn't want anymore.
It wasn't because anything stopped working.
But it was, so all those things, I don't see them in the current environment.
I do see that billions of dollars are being thrown at R&D, not at, you know, buying another
dot com with no concept whatsoever.
I mean, it's good to see that some of the bubbles that we had only a couple of years
ago, like the SPAC bubble, like the bubble in the meme stocks, those bubble seems to
have burst without any economic consequence whatsoever.
So I think the analogy is not a perfect one between the current environment and the 1990s.
And yeah, these big companies, they, you know, look, Apple decided that they're not going
to do auto, auto cars after all.
And so apparently they blew up a few billion dollars on that product.
But you would note looking at its stock price or, you know, anybody's concerns about that.
And quite the opposite.
People think, well, you know, if they tried it and they didn't like it and they walked
away from it, that leaves them with a billion dollars that they could spend on something
else that might actually be worthwhile.
Everybody's waiting to see how Apple is going to get into the AI business.
But I think it's pretty simple.
You start selling phones that have some AI features and it's a whole new, it's a whole
new iPhone.
So I think that's, that's, that's really what Apple is going to do is they're going to say,
you know, now we have AI in our iPhones and say, well, I want the latest version of this
thing.
Again, I can hardly wait for Siri to actually be a personal assistant.
Okay.
So, um, sounds like a, you're, you're bullish just on the technology and where it could
go.
You, you, you believe we're already seeing a productivity benefit from it and you, uh,
you didn't say this, but I'm assuming you're seeing a tailwind of that going on for the
foreseeable future. Um, and it sounds like you think the capital that is entering this
space is being, um, allocated more intelligently, efficiently than it was back in the.com.
Just throw money at anything with.com at the end of it.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, you're, you're right.
I mean, the back, back then the driving force was the internet, uh, this time the driving
forces are artificial intelligence.
Um, but I think, uh, there's more money being thrown at R and D now than there was, uh,
being thrown into the inner internet.
It was really more into companies that claimed that they could use the internet to do all
sorts of, uh, neat things.
All right.
Last point on this, then I I'm going to try to get to some of these other topics in the
time we have.
Um, so, uh, again, I'm just going to go back to Nvidia and it's, it's priced a sales ratio
here, right?
Um, we, we can argue whether Nvidia is, um, going to continue growing at the rate it needs
to, to, to earn that price to sales ratio.
And of course there's concerns about competitors coming into the market and all that type of
stuff.
Um, I guess my question is just, um, you know, if again, looking back at the internet, it,
it took a while for the value to be unlocked by that new technology to, to really manifest
itself.
And I guess the question is, is, um, uh, even if the current expectation of the massive
size of the AI opportunity is here, um, you know, how much of that future value are we
pulling into today where, you know, at 30 or 40 times sales, you know, famously like
the company in theory has to return everything to investors for the next 30 years without
having any expenses.
Right. Like, like, you know, uh, again, it goes back to sort of the price and the value
thing like, like, and I'm asking this in the context of your, your, your three-year projections,
like maybe do we get up to 7,000 on the S and P, but then we realized we got crazy and
we go back down to 4,500 for a while, but yeah, we end the year at 6,000.
Yeah. I think AI is going to have to deliver some tangible results that actually make a
difference to earnings. I mean, right now it's kind of like what we did see in the 1990s,
which was the, um, the, the, the technology companies that made the PCs and provided the
software. They're the ones that, uh, saw their stock prices, uh, really sore and the impact
on the earnings and the productivity of everybody else, uh, wasn't as obvious as a matter of
fact, we had a huge productivity boom, the growth boom in the late 1990s. Uh, and that
wasn't because technology was making productivity better. It was technology was just producing
a lot more Dell boxes with Microsoft software in them. And, uh, I remember I was at, uh,
on wall street at the time and the firm I was working with, I had to be very careful
walking down the hall, not to trip over a Dell box. Everybody suddenly, you know, for
a while there, you know, getting a laptop or a PC was like, you know, only for the,
you know, the, the, the top stars. And then all of a sudden everybody was, was getting
it and then everybody got it. And once everybody got it, that was the end of the productivity
boom. Right. Uh, and productivity really fizzled big time. So there were really no longterm
consequences of the initial technology boom of the internet and Intel and Microsoft and
all, all that. Uh, and I guess there's, it's possible here, but here what's different is
I think first and foremost is the cloud. The cloud is really the, the huge productivity
event of the past several years, because in the past you'd have to have hundreds of people
in an it department in order to maintain your PCs with the updated software and the fixed
things. Um, this time around, uh, one it person working out of anywhere, uh, can operate remotely
and, uh, uh, help you do what you need to fix. And the cloud now actually allows, uh,
for programs to be rented rather than sold, uh, because they get updated automatically.
So we're constantly getting better and better software automatically without anybody having
to, uh, uh, to install it. I, I view artificial intelligence is just the continuation of the
technology revolution that started in the 1990s. It's just making it better and better.
And it's all about computing. It's all about speed of light. Uh, and I think, uh, what,
uh, and videos chips do is, you know, first they started out in gaming, then they went
to Bitcoin and then they realized that they can take those very same chips and, uh, lead
to much faster computing with, with those, with those chips. People are working on quantum
computing. Now, if that technology ever takes off in a big time and becomes cost effective,
that could put these GPU chips out of, out of business. Um, but maybe Nvidia will invest
in some company that, uh, revolutionizes the quantum computing, uh, technology, which has
been promising for a long time to be, uh, the fastest, but, uh, as, as yet to actually
deliver. Uh, but it's, you know, it's, it could be the next new, new thing. Uh, but
for now, um, you know, there are some companies like Nvidia that have had huge, uh, runs and
maybe they're going to have some come up and, but, um, you know, the, the head of Nvidia
is as a few times said that the way he manages his company is though is, is as though it's
going to go out of business tomorrow. So at least he doesn't have the, uh, the ego of
thinking that, you know, they've got the technology that, uh, they can, uh, sell to the rest of
us forever. Quite the opposite. They're spending a lot of money on the next, uh, iteration,
the next generation of their technology. So if these companies are running basically scared
that they know that if they don't innovate, somebody else will, and we'll put them out
of business. Uh, look, look at Facebook. Uh, you know, he kind of, uh, Zuckerberg kind
of went off in the meta versus direction and started spending too much money in that area
and the stock market punished him and he doesn't like to see to lose that much wealth in such
a short period of time. He said, all right, you want to see me make money? I'll show you
how I make money. I just cut my costs and, uh, you know, ramp up where I'm productive
and, uh, move forward and, uh, and, and continue to invest in, in other technologies without
kind of going, uh, going wild. So there are always these tech companies always throwing
tech spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. Um, and they've got the cashflow, they're
not as dependent on borrowing. Uh, so they, they are unique. Um, you're not going to find
them anywhere else in the world. I mean, it's, it's really amazing when we talk about the
magnificent seven, they're American companies, but you know, Nvidia, by the way, uh, comes
up with the ideas and then to actually produce them, they go to Taiwan. They have Taiwan semi
manufactured these things. So, um, you know, there, there are a lot of innovators out there
and they are having an impact on, uh, I think there are having and will have an impact on
productivity and therefore our earnings and that drives the market. So again, um, I say
this with some, some trepidation that, uh, you know, I'm, uh, I'm going to make a top
year, but, uh, you know, maybe 15 isn't the fair value multiple for the market anymore.
Maybe it's more like, you know, something like 18. I know the market's selling at 21,
but if you take out the magnificent seven, it's selling around 18 because companies are
going to benefit from using these technologies. They have to use the technology to increase
their productivity. If they don't, somebody else will.
Okay. So, um, you're, you're, um, optimistic about the AI wave and the transformative effect
that that's going to have. And maybe that does argue for a permanently higher multiple
than historic for the market because all companies are going to be using AI. I understand that.
Let's get to the cost side for a second. Um, this is one of the questions I've been trying
to get to, but you just keep giving such great answers. I want to let you run. Um, uh, so
you, you talked about the surprise with which I think everybody has had that, um, the cost
of capital is now an awful lot higher than it was during the XRP era. Um, and yet the
economy is chugging along here in the U S right. Um, another question I want to ask
you if we have time is the role of liquidity of net liquidity flows. Um, because most of
the people I've talked to, their, their reason for explaining how we've avoided a recession
to date, um, has been that that actual net liquidity flows have been positive, um, basically
since about October of 2022. And that's what created the market bottom. And that's what,
uh, powered everything basically since, um, but where I'm going with this is, um, we have,
you know, a lot of companies that are staring at this debt maturity wall, right? Not necessarily
the top tech companies that are very cash rich and debt low, but, but a large part of
the rest of corporate corporate fleet. Um, and I heard you say earlier, like, yeah, whatever,
like maybe, you know, rates have normalized and maybe we just hang out here longer. And
my question is, is, um, explain to me how, especially when debt levels, both nationally
corporate wise and household wise generally, I'm painting with a broad brush here are just
much higher than they were back when, when this was a more normal cost of capital for
us.
Well, look, the, uh, the, the, the bearish story, uh, that certainly is, is not consistent
with the roaring 2020s, but it's, uh, it's, it's a much more dire outlook is that, uh,
we're going to have a debt crisis. Um, Ray Dalio has been talking about a debt crisis
for, for a couple of years. And, uh, last year seemed to be talking as though it's,
it's, it's imminent. And it certainly felt like a debt crisis last year between August
and November 1st, when we saw the bond yield jump from four and a quarter percent to 5%.
Uh, I coined the phrase, the bond vigilantes back in the early eighties. And all of a sudden
I'm getting calls from reporters all over the place, the bond vigilantes back. And I
said, yeah, it looks like they're, they're back, but, uh, I think there's going to be
some rate at which they'll be buying again. And it turned out to be 5%. And, uh, here
we are back at, you know, around four and a quarter percent, which is the kind of, uh,
bond yield level, the 10 year bonding level that we saw between before the great financial
crisis, the real abnormality was the period between the great financial crisis and the
great virus crisis. Uh, when central banks were obsessed with getting inflation up to
2% and felt that they have to head have ultra easy monetary policy, but their answer to
your question about liquidity, liquidity is a funny variable. I don't know how to measure
it. I guess you can look at them too, or you could look at the money market funds. Uh,
you know, there, there are different measures of liquidity, but it's a funny variable. It's
like, I always find that when the stock market's going down, all of a sudden everybody's telling
you liquidity dried up. Then when it's going up, suddenly, Oh, well, we got all this liquidity
out there. And well, what about the, some of the fundamentals? What I've like, well,
maybe the market went up because investors suddenly realized we're not going to have
a recession after all. I mean, the fundamentals certainly suggested that we had a very, very
mild earnings recession and it was really just a profit margin recession. Revenues kept
going on to, to all time, uh, rec record highs. Uh, but, uh, I'm, I am worried about those
things that I worry about. I worry about the middle East and all prices going up. I worry
about this monthly chart that we're all looking at on the amount of interest that the government
has to pay, uh, on its, uh, on its huge debt. Uh, every, every month that number keeps going
up. It's bigger than defense spending probably, but by now, um, but I, again, I try to be
balanced and I point out that, uh, it's called debt interest outlays of the, of the federal
government outlays tend to be stimulative and somebody is getting that interest. Somebody
bought those bonds, they're getting their, the interest. And that's actually been, been
stimulative. Uh, I'm thinking that yeah, the debt to GDP ratio of the government is going
to go higher and higher, but if we get better than expected growth based on productivity
and maybe lower than expected inflation, maybe the bond yield settles back down below 4%.
Uh, and uh, maybe we find that, uh, the debt to GDP ratio doesn't go up as much because
we do in fact generate some, some earnings. Uh, we saw in November 1st when of last year
when the bond yield got to 5% that bill Ackerman who made a lot of money being short, uh, said,
you know, I made enough, I'm getting out. That very same day, uh, Jerome Powell gave
a press conference and signed it more dovish. But what really happened most importantly
on November 1st is Janet Yellen. I, I went to Yale, I got a PhD at Yale. She, she did
it six, six years earlier. I'm not that smart. So fortunately she made some Xerox notes that
we all cribbed from afterwards. And so she got me through through the PhD program there.
So I, I owe her a lot smart lady and she is no fool. She saw that the bond vigilantes
were acting up again and she basically said, you don't like my bonds, I'll give you bills.
And so she started issuing a lot more bills and fewer bonds. And maybe we're just going
to find that the government, uh, operates by issuing bills and we don't have the bond
vigilantes to worry about in that scenario. Uh, look, I've been doing this for a lot of
years and for, you know, over 40 years and over that entire period, people have been
predicting that the deficit, the debt we're going to take us down hasn't happened so far.
But I, you know, I mean, it's, uh, the, the, the amount of debt is, uh, is, is insane.
There's no doubt about that. And I'll worry about it when the bond market's worrying about
it. I was worried in August, uh, September, October, August, September, October last year.
Uh, and then suddenly I wasn't worried about it cause 5% worked and uh, inflation came
down as I expected and that got the bond investors back in. So yeah, you gotta put that on the
worry list. Uh, you know, there's no way I can put lipstick on that pig. Um, you know,
uh, I can't make everything look good here. Uh, I, I, I try to be balanced and in this
case, uh, I got nothing good to say about it. Uh, Larry Fink, uh, in his, uh, recent,
uh, annual report spent a lot of time on, uh, the, um, irresponsible, uh, federal government
and, and the amount of debt. Um, but on the other hand, it's clearly been a stimulative.
One of the reasons we haven't had a recession because the government is still spending a
lot of money on infrastructure. There's a lot of incentives for onshoring. And so, uh,
you got to factor that in. All right. Um, in just the last couple of
minutes we have, I just want to touch on a topic we, we touched on at the end of our
last talk, um, which is the growing wealth divide, I'd say in this country, but I don't
think it's limited to the U S and since the, what you just called the great virus crisis,
which maybe that's what they will call the COVID pandemic or pandemic error going forward.
Um, you know, since then we saw this explosion in inflation and really in cost of living
for a long time, wages were real wages were negative, right? Uh, we, we, we are back to
positive wage growth now. Um, but that real weight, real wages, positive, real wage growth,
but, but that growth rate is declining now again. Um, and, uh, I don't have a survey
in front of me here. I had it in a past interview, but, but something like two thirds of households
say that, that their wages have not kept up with their cost of living. Right. So we've
seen, um, I would say a pinching of the middle and working classes. Um, you know, pretty
serious one over the past couple of years. Um, the, uh, the policies that have been implemented
and just the way in which the system is now working is, um, you know, if, if, if you're
one of the few on a relative basis, percent of Americans that own financial assets, um,
you're doing great now, right? Because, you know, the, the, the markets basically saved
your bacon over the past year and a half. Right. So you're doing great. Whereas the
average person, um, doesn't have a lot of exposure to the stock market. And, um, they've,
they've been getting squeezed increasingly squeezed the way that I've said. And we had,
we had a wealth gap issue before the pandemic hit, but it seems to have really poured more
jet fuel on that fire. Um, how concerned are you about this? Cause when I, when I hear
about the future that you talk about, it seems to me that those that own shares and all these
companies are going to do great. And if productivity goes up due to technology, um, there is in
many cases are less of a need for humans. Right. And so, you know, we can, we can make,
we can make some pretty dire projections. I don't want to say dire, but we can make some
pessimistic projections about, uh, the labor force going forward, either because we go
into recession and the cut costs companies have to lay people off or on the other side,
because AI makes companies realize I don't need to hire as many people and people are
expensive. And we have the precedent of X or Twitter where, you know, Elon Musk got
rid of three quarters of the company and it's still working. Right. So a lot of companies
like, wow, maybe I need to really reevaluate how many people I need.
Well, uh, maybe that's why I come across as a perma bull and an optimist is because stories
like that are so well thought out and, uh, and talk, talked about that. Uh, I find myself
saying, well, that makes a lot of sense, but first of all, uh, let's, let's, let's, let's
see what's going right here. Uh, I think when we're looking before we look at wealth, let's,
let's, as you did, let's look at income. And, uh, in order to have income, you have to have
a job. The unemployment rate has been below 4% for the past 26 months. It's the longest
stretch that we've had in decades. Uh, so we've got a fully employed economy. If you
want a job that our jobs out there and, uh, the minimum wage has gone up a lot over the
past couple of years. There has clearly been, uh, some writing, uh, improvement in, uh,
in nominal wages. Uh, you're absolutely right that inflation adjusted wages went flat during
the pandemic. Uh, but, uh, starting last year, uh, inflation adjusted wages have actually
been going up to a record high. And when I talk about wages, uh, I have two series. I
have one for all workers and I have one for, uh, what are called production and non-supervisory
workers that accounts for 80% of the labor force. So you, you don't have the rich, rich
in there. You've got working staffs like, like you and me, I don't know if some people
would cost working staffs working from home, but, uh, you know, people who are working,
uh, they're not at the top of the, the, you know, they're not both millionaires or billionaires.
Uh, their real wage is at an all time record high. So, you know, people tend to be pessimistic
when they're, when they're interviewed. But there are a lot of interviews now where surveys
would say that, uh, a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck. I think some of this
is missing the demography of what's going on here. And maybe I'm, maybe I'm too much
into the demography story. I'm a baby boomer. There's a lot of us, maybe we're arrogant.
I don't know. You know, uh, there's the, the younger folks say, okay, boomer, uh, there's
a, we know it all and we really don't. Uh, but I'll tell you what I do know is that I'm
still working for a living and I'm, I just turned 74. Uh, a lot of my friends are, uh,
are retiring and a lot of them own their own homes. You know that of all the homeowners
out there, 40% of them don't have any mortgage at all. And a lot of them are the baby boomers.
Uh, their college expenses, they're behind them. Uh, their assets, all time record high.
The baby boomers have $75 trillion in assets. That's half of the assets of all households
in the country. So that gets me to conclude that a lot of the wealth has to do with what
Spock said in star Trek. Uh, you know, he raised his, his, his figures like this and
he said, you know, live long and prosper. One of the reasons that we have a wealth and
income inequality is because people are living longer and a lot of them are the baby boomers
and they have accumulated a lot of income and wealth, uh, by buying houses, by buying
stocks with pensions, with life insurance and so on. And the younger kids are struggling,
but the younger kids are also, unless their parents spend it all, uh, the younger kids
are going to be inheriting a lot of dough. And again, I know this from experience. I
know people my, my age, not my age, but younger people, but you know, adults, uh, older adults
that their parents have gone and they're suddenly got a house on the Lake. Um, so there's a
lot of that. So we've never ever had a richer demographic situation that we have now. Wealth
of the household sector, all time record high, $155 trillion. Half of that with a baby boomer,
$165 trillion. And that's another thing that the pessimist missed is these people are retiring.
They're spending money. They don't have any real serious expenses so they can go on trips.
They can go to restaurants every day. They can go check into the hospital and pay the
copay and guess where employment's been growing in all these areas. So that's helped to keep
the economy growing. Uh, so the, the wealth story is a very complicated one. I'm not going
to pretend or claim that everybody's doing great, but, uh, from a, from a point of view
of the macroeconomic data, a GDP, all time record high, uh, inflation adjusted consumption,
all time record high. I mean, no, the richer, the so-called 1%, the 1% can't be spending
that much on food and, uh, cars and all that consumption per household, all time record
high adjusted for inflation. So I think things aren't that bad. They're
not as bad as we're being led to believe. And you know, there were some people saying
that real wages have stagnated for decades. And when you actually look at the data, it's
been going up 1.4% per year since 1995 on a consistent basis. And that's like a doubling
in the standard of living over a 25 year period. So there's a lot of misinformation along those
lines, but again, I'm not going to tell you there aren't people suffering that there aren't
people living paycheck to paycheck, but I do know from personal experience, uh, having
five kids that, uh, some of them, you know, not being fully on their own, they're out
of college and that costs me a bundle. Uh, but, uh, there are a lot of parents my age
helping their kids. And so if you ask all my younger kids, two of my younger kids, you
know, how's their money holding up from their, from their salary and say, I live paycheck
to paycheck. They don't forget. They don't, they don't seem to remember that I'm paying
some of the credit card bills. Yeah. And isn't it funny that way? Yeah. When your kids tell
you they're living independently and you're like, well, I think we need to figure out
the definition of independent. Yeah. Independent. Exactly. Um, all right. Um, kind of where
I wanted to dig into question and we're just going to have to punt for next time, Ed, but
was it's more kind of a difference of them between the mean and the median. Um, I think
if you look at the mean, yeah, no doubt, we're still heading up into good territory. The
question is, is do we have kind of a composition issue where, you know, things are concentrating
and more and more people are, are, are feeling left out and, and do we, does that bring us
towards some sort of social friction point? But yeah, I think the social friction point
is really that everything's been politicized and it seems as though people are born with
a, a left of center and a right of center DNA and that, that I am very concerned about
our, our domestic politics and how, um, how partisan it, it, it has become. Uh, but in
terms of, uh, the, the economy, uh, look, you mentioned before that as the economy becomes
more productive, uh, more technology, I don't think it displaces workers. I think it augments
add the, uh, the knowledge, the productivity of workers is this productivity boom is based
on a brain rather than brawn. Past, past productivity booms have been all about, you know, being
able to move things and lift things, uh, without a manual effort. This productivity boom is
all about, uh, making a smarter, faster, you know, think faster and get information faster.
And that's something that, um, just makes people better at their work and enjoy it more.
So I think that's a positive situation. And another point I want to make, uh, is real
wages are tied in at the hip to, uh, to productivity. Um, and, uh, on a consistently and a consistent
basis that you don't have an increase in real wages without productivity going up. So productivity
increases real wages. Um, maybe it gets rid of some jobs as you mentioned, but those,
you know, we, we've got a very dynamic, uh, labor force, 200,000 people per week, uh,
file for initial unemployment claims. That's, uh, that's, that's, that's a lot of multiply
that by 52 and you get a big number. So there's a lot of churn in our labor market and there's
a lot of job openings. And very often when people get fired or, uh, look for another
job, they do it to get a better pain. All right. Well, we'll have to leave it there.
Lots of questions still on address. So Ed, I am going to have to take you up on your
kind offer. We'll have you back on the program again at some point this year. Um, and obviously
if you see anything in your crystal ball that, that makes you change material, any of your
forecasts that you've talked to us, uh, yeah, the one you have back there, uh, just let
me know and come back on this program anytime you like. Um, so for folks that have really
enjoyed this conversation, um, I didn't even get to my point of, of complimenting you on
the fantastic charts that you put together, um, over there at your identity.com. But for
folks that would like to follow you in your work, where should they go?
Yeah. Yardeni.com is the homepage for the, for the website. Uh, we have a product for
institutional investors, which is pricey, I admit. Um, and then we also have one for
individual investors. Uh, you'll find it at your denny.com. But, uh, if you want to go
there directly, it's a yard, Denny quicktakes.com and it kind of shows the re the important
relationship between the macroeconomic data that comes out on a daily basis and its impact
on the financial markets and how the financial markets are anticipating the data. So what
we anticipate the markets will do. So, uh, you might find that of some interest and both
of them are available on a trial basis. Alright, fantastic. I highly recommend folks subscribe.
I'm subscribed to the quicktakes. Um, and Ed, when I edit this, I'll put up the links
to both of those prominently on the screen. So folks know where to go. Folks, there'll
be links in the description below this video as well. Um, I got one last question for you,
Ed, and that's that we've been talking about money and money related topics this whole
time. What's one non money related investment that you encourage folks, uh, to, uh, to consider
adopting in their lives? And while you chew on that, I'm just going to do 30 seconds of
housekeeping here. Folks, if you've enjoyed having Ed in the program and would like to
have him come back on when his crystal ball tells him something important is cooking,
please let him know by hitting the like button and then clicking on the red subscribe button
below. So what was that little bell icon right next to it? Um, if you want to get my writeups
of all the, um, interviews that we do on this channel, including this one here with Ed,
uh, just go, uh, subscribe to our sub stack, our premium sub stack subscribers, get those
notes. Uh, that's just at Adam taggert.substack.com. And finally, if, um, you, uh, want some help
figuring out how to navigate, uh, your, uh, financial wealth through the, whatever future
may lie ahead, especially if it's as sanguine for the next three years, as Ed thinks it
may be, then consider scheduling a free consultation with one of the financial advisors that thoughtful
money endorses, uh, to do that, just fill out the short form@thoughtfulmoney.com. These
consultations are totally free. There's no commitment to work with these guys. Uh, it's
just a free public service that these advisors offer. And these are the same advisors that
you see with me on this program week after week after week. All right, Ed, thanks so
much. And wrapping up here again, let's get to that last question. What's one non money
related investment you would encourage folks to consider.
Well, folks covers a lot of people at different ages. So I, I can't, I can't answer the question
for, yeah, for younger people. I would say it has to be a money advice. And that is by
dividend yielding stocks, put them away and forget about them, uh, or at least focus on
companies where the dividends are rising, uh, for, for older folks, uh, you know, we're,
we're, you know, on average, we're all living longer, uh, enjoy life. Uh, if, if you can
figure out how to, uh, enjoy retirement, traveling, and having a good time, uh, with, with, with
your, your spouses, uh, uh, do that, uh, play golf. I don't play golf. I do play tennis.
So I think, uh, I like the idea of working cause I think it keeps your mind, uh, mind

All right. So basically keep active, but, uh, really, really focus on savoring, uh, life.
Cause again, that's, you know, at the end of the day, that's, that's all we got to make
the most of it. All right, Ed, I really appreciate it. Thanks so much for coming on everybody
else so much for watching.
Thank you.
