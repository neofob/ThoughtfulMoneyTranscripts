Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
2023, a year nearly everyone expected a recession,
has instead seen impressive economic growth
and the market's power to all time highs.
How did this happen?
Especially as the Federal Reserve kept interest rates
above 5% while conducting quantitative tightening.
In a word, liquidity.
Liquidity steadily rose throughout 2023
and, like an incoming ocean tide, rose all boats.
How, why, where is it coming from?
And if it's such a key driver of asset prices,
where's it headed from here?
To find out, we're going to have
a very important conversation today with Michael Howell,
founder and CEO of Cross Border Capital.
Michael, thanks so much for coming on the program today,
all the way from London.
Yeah. Hi, Adam. Great to be here.
Well, great to have you on here.
And Michael, I'm so glad to have you here today
because I have been mentioning your name
in almost every one of the past interviews
I've done on this channel in the past few weeks.
It just does seem that maybe, perhaps,
we can throw all the other macro indicators
out the window and just focus on liquidity
and that's going to tell us where markets are going.
I know that this is a saw
that you've probably been playing for a long time
and maybe folks are just beginning to really wake up to this.
But I want to get into the weeds of this with you,
but we're in this "tightening regime"
where most of the world's central banks
have been hiking interest rates
and conducting quantitative tightening.
So most people have been thinking
that we've been draining the pond of liquidity
when quite actually it may be indeed the opposite.
And that might actually explain
why the recession never showed up
and why stocks did so well this year.
So I want to get into all of this with you.
And obviously, where is it headed next?
If we can, though, just as a jumping off point,
use the broad question I like to ask everybody
at the beginning of these discussions,
what's your current assessment of the global economy
in financial markets?
I think broadly positive, Adam.
I mean, I've been upbeat pretty much all year.
I mean, we think the cycle bottom in October of '22,
it's expanding, we've got the wind behind us,
and I think that wind is going to last
probably until late 2025.
So our view is this is definitely an up cycle,
and it's an up cycle certainly
for financial markets right now.
And ultimately, the real economy will start to get
or feel the positive effects of that.
May not be for a few months, but I think it's coming.
Okay, great.
I can't wait to dig into this with you for so many reasons,
but a big one being, Michael, just for full disclosure,
that is quite different than almost all the guests
I've had on this program.
I would say I've had folks on a spectrum
from the very bearish, like recession next year,
40% decline in the S&P,
to folks that kind of think of recession,
we deserve to have one,
they're just not seeing it in the data yet,
but they're keeping a close eye on it,
and maybe at some point it might come.
You really sort of seem to be saying,
"Man, we're in a bull cycle here,"
and one that could probably last the next two years.
All right, well then let's just start
right in the heart of this discussion.
Is that because of your outlook for liquidity?
Do you see liquidity sort of continuing to rise,
and to your point, keep a wind at the back of the economy
and the markets for the next two years?
I think that that's part of the reason.
I mean, I think that there's a number of sort of
maybe starting points in this discussion.
I mean, the first thing to say is that
understanding the flow of money in the world economy
is really one of the critical factors
that one needs to have for any assessment,
whether it's for financial markets
or for the world real economy.
I started my career at the US investment bank,
Salomon Brothers.
Salomon Brothers made its name,
particularly in the 1980s and 1990s,
as an institution that understood money flows.
It was the world's biggest fixed income investor or trader,
and it needed to understand sources of liquidity,
what central banks were doing,
and how that money propagated itself through the system.
And I've sort of, if you like, carried that on
or maybe made that more of an international dimension.
It was originally sort of thought up by Henry Kaufman,
the head of research as a US tool, largely a US tool,
but you need to think about this in a global context.
So that's pretty much what cross-border capital
has been doing.
So I think that one thing to say
is money flows are very important.
I think the other thing to say is that,
you know, there's a number of other points
that one can add here.
I mean, one is that economists have been trying to predict
the next Lehman moment every year for the last,
what, 12, 13 years now, and it's never come.
I don't think there is a Lehman moment out there.
I think that that was a very much a one-off factor,
but there could be financial crises of different strengths
or different meters that could occur.
But what we need to do is to understand
the liquidity background to try and get a gauge of those.
And that's one of the things that we do.
Now, in that context,
think about what financial markets are doing.
If you pick up an economic textbook,
it tells you that the financial sector is there
to raise new money for capital investment.
Now, I think that's an old story.
I think that doesn't happen very much anymore
because there isn't a great deal of capex going on
in the mature advanced economies.
A lot of it clearly is going on in China,
but that may be a different case.
What we spend most of our time doing
and what financial markets are doing almost every second,
24/7, is basically trying to refinance existing debt.
We have got a huge mountain of debt out there.
I mean, eye-watering amounts, $350 trillion plus,
according to the International Monetary Fund on last count.
And the point about debt is that debt
needs to be refinanced.
And this is the point that we keep trying to hammer home.
If you've got that amount of debt
with an average life of that debt of, say, five years,
that means you've got to roll $70 trillion of debt every year,
and that is a challenge.
Now, in order to roll the debt, what you need
is balance sheet capacity.
And balance sheet capacity, particularly
among financial intermediaries, is basically
what we call liquidity.
That's our definition of liquidity.
It's a gross balance sheet concept.
Now, contrast that notion of the capacity of capital
in the system with a traditional notion
that what you need to look at is the cost of capital.
Well, if we were in a world where capital spending was
dominant, I'd come quietly and say, well, OK,
interest rates are important.
But since debt financing is the paramount issue,
you've got to look at the capacity of capital,
in other words, liquidity in the system.
Every financial crisis you can think of in the last 20 or 30
years has been a refinancing crisis.
And it's required the Federal Reserve or central banks
to come back in and add liquidity,
and it's as simple as that.
And looking forward, nothing has really changed.
So in other words, what you've got is a very different world.
That has meant, as a corollary, that the polarity
of the financial system has changed.
So a lot of the old relationships
don't kind of work.
So if you come back to what economists have been saying
and how economists look at the world, we don't use,
we never use, would never use, macroeconomics
to forecast the stock market or asset prices, OK?
Because asset markets are leading indicators.
They discount the future.
You use the asset market performance
to predict the economy, not the other way around.
If you try and do it in reverse, you get into a terrible muddle.
So basically what we're saying here
is you've got to try and understand financial flows
within the system, and that's principally what we do.
Why is it that the world real economy has been more robust
maybe this year than many economists predicted?
I think there's a number of reasons.
One of the main reasons, which may have only a small amount
to do with liquidity, is that fiscal spend in the US
is actually so strong.
There's a huge fiscal expansion going on,
which is lifting the US economy.
Liquidity has played a role because it's
lifted asset markets, and there's
been a positive wealth effect that's embraced the consumer.
And you might argue as well that China
has been putting a lot of money back
into its economy in the last, certainly the last six months,
which is starting to lift activity there.
So I think there are a number of factors
that are liquidity related, but I
think a lot of the reason for a strong world
economy in many ways comes back to this very, very generous US
fiscal stance.
OK.
So if I heard you right, it's sort
of like what used to be the tail that the dog wagged
is now the tail wags the dog here, which
is they used to say, look, the economy and how it operates
will dictate sort of what the stock markets do.
You're now saying it's really the assets side of things that
will drive the economy, right?
I think that's very fair.
Absolutely.
But I would say, in actual fact, that it's
been a misguided view to say that you use the economy
to forecast the stock market.
I understand that a lot of economists do that,
but I just think that's simply wrong.
OK.
So you're basically telling people, look,
if you're following that old model,
you might need to consider replacing it.
When you talk about balance sheet capacity,
I assume you mean the ability of balance sheets
to take on more debt as we're going
through this continuous debt refinancing wave.
Do you mean corporate balance sheets,
or do you mean central bank balance sheets?
Well, I'm actually thinking of the balance sheet
of the financial sector of credit providers.
And those balance sheets of banks, shadow banks, et cetera,
are largely governed by what the central banks do.
Not exclusively, but the central banks play a big role.
And the two things really to look at,
as we've tried to articulate in our writings, number one
is the size of the central bank balance sheet.
That's important, although I'm going to correct myself here
and say, actually, what you really want to look at,
because this is going to be important when analysing
the Fed, is not simply the size of the balance sheet,
but actually, more importantly, the liquidity-generating parts
of the balance sheet, which is a subtle but important twist.
And the second thing to look at is the extent
to which that liquidity can be leveraged in the system.
And that can come through what's called collateral, which
is, if you like, the backing for loans.
But one of the things you need to look at,
as well, is the multiplier that that liquidity
has in terms of the broader aggregate
picture for global liquidity.
And that, in many ways, is related
to the degree of volatility in the bond markets.
And this is a very wonkish point.
I don't want to labour it too much.
But effectively, what you would say
is that, since we've got central banks that are generally
expanding their balance sheets now--
let me say that again, expanding their balance sheets,
because everyone thinks they're contracting,
but they're starting to expand their balance sheets.
And you've got, as well, a multiplier
on that balance sheet expansion, which
is starting to expand, as well.
You've got this double whammy which is coming in,
which is forcing global liquidity higher.
And that is one of the reasons that stock markets have
been strong this year, generally around the world,
but particularly in the US.
What's more, if you drill down into asset price performance--
and I can tick a few boxes here and say, look,
consider, for example, the fact the S&P is up.
Consider the fact that it's being led by technology stocks.
Consider the fact that corporate debt
has been a pretty decent performer this year.
Consider the fact that, basically,
certainly in the first half year, bond duration
was a bad idea, and the commodity markets
have been very lackluster through this year.
All those features are features of the early part
of the liquidity cycle.
So everything that you're seeing in the markets,
the markets are screaming at us that this is a liquidity cycle
inflection that is turning up.
There's nothing unusual about this cycle at all.
Nothing unusual about this cycle at all.
OK, so you're not surprised at all
about what's going on here.
I really want to have you walk people through what you see.
A couple of quick questions just to get out of my head
to make sure that I can follow you from here.
One is, you said, people used to think that interest rates
really mattered, but they really don't that much.
And help me understand that in a world
where you're expecting balance sheets to basically be
able to take on more debt, but the debt
is a lot more expensive now than it was two years ago.
Well, I'll give you two examples.
I'm not saying that interest rates are completely
unimportant, but I'm saying that they're much
diminished in their importance.
If you consider a home mortgage, you're a mortgagee.
You've got a home mortgage coming up for renewal.
You've got to roll that mortgage,
and maybe it's coming up to its term of 20 years,
but you want to roll it on for another five or 10 years.
What's critical for you as a mortgagee
is whether you can get the role on that debt, not so much
what the interest rate is.
If you can't get the role, you're homeless.
And the same with corporations.
If they can't get the role on their debt, they default.
So the role is particularly important.
So in a world where there's lots of debt refinancing required,
you need that role.
It's more important than the interest rate that you pay.
Now, clearly I'll come quietly and say,
well, if you're charging 20%, 30% interest,
that clearly is a bogey to jump as well.
But the plain fact is that the current levels of interest
rates is the role that's more important than the level
of rates.
It's starting to be clear, because it's
an existential choice.
It's I pay more for the debt or I die.
So I'll do everything I can to pay more for the debt.
Yeah, exactly.
That's the point.
You don't want to be homeless.
It focuses the mind.
But this is just an example to try and extrapolate.
The other point to make is that people will say,
well, OK, what we're doing in terms of valuing stocks
or valuing investments is to use a discount factor, which
is an interest rate, OK?
Well, OK, I understand the math of that.
That's clear.
The point is that if you look at the long-term track record,
there is not a close relationship
between interest rates and the value of the stock market,
or more particularly, the valuation of the stock market.
And I challenge anyone that disagrees
to go back and look at the wonderful data set
that Robert Shiller has on his website, where
he looks at going back to, I think,
it's 1870 or whatever in US data, data on the price
earnings multiple of Wall Street and interest rates.
Is there a correlation?
It's very, very weak.
Now, why is that?
The reason I would argue is there are not
that many people, either historically or now,
who are doing the arbitrage between bonds and stocks, OK?
Now, let me give you two examples.
First of all, let's think of the British example, pension funds,
where pension funds in the UK are more mature than in the US.
10 years ago, more than 50% of pension fund assets
were in stocks, OK?
And the rest were predominantly in fixed income.
What you've got now is 14% in stocks and the vast amount
in fixed income securities.
So in other words, what I'm saying
is the ability to do the arbitrage
is not there between stocks and bonds.
It's much diminished, OK?
The second thing is think of the US with 401(k) plans.
If I'm correct, using some of the data that comes from--
the very good data that comes from Mike Green,
is that something like 85% of 401(k) plans
are now target life funds, OK, which are not
doing an asset allocation.
And this is basically saying there's not an arbitrage
between stocks and bonds.
Therefore, what works is the inflation rate.
Look at the inflation rate, the underlying inflation rate,
as your discount factor, and the stock market
is very, very closely related inversely to inflation.
Now, what have you had this year?
You've had three things principally going on, certainly
in the first half year.
You've had bond yields going up, right?
That should be negative for stocks.
But you've also, countering that,
had global liquidity rising and US liquidity rising
and inflation falling sharply.
It's the latter two factors that have driven the stock market.
The fact that inflation has come down
and the fact that global liquidity has gone up.
That's what markets are about.
Risk assets depend on low inflation
and lots of liquidity.
All right, and sorry, just to interject,
make sure I heard you right.
Sounds like you said--
because I started my career in investment banking on Wall
Street, I remember doing tons of discount rates,
weighted average cost of capital.
And as your discount rate increases,
your valuation decreases, right?
Your NPV decreases.
You're saying-- and a big part of creating the discount
rate in the traditional models is
you start with the risk-free rate, which basically you're
pulling from the US 10-year as a benchmark for that.
You're saying instead of looking at interest rates
for the discount rate, we should be
looking at the inflation rate.
So we've had disinflation and pretty extreme disinflation
from 9% to 3% over the past year.
So as that has gone down, if you use that as the discount rate,
then your NPV should be going up pretty dramatically, which does
support what the markets have done.
You're nodding as I'm saying this.
So I'm following you correctly?
Correct.
Absolutely 100% correct.
That's right.
In other words, what we're really debating
is what is the appropriate discount factor.
And it certainly isn't the 10-year bond.
And to suggest that that's a risk-free instrument
after what's happened in the last two years
is, I think, fanciful.
OK, that's super interesting.
Let me just ask you this last thing on interest rates.
And I know you've got some charts we want to get to.
And I'm going to let you just run as much as you want to
in explaining this to everybody.
But let me share one image with you here,
which is a chart of the Fed funds rate.
This particular one's been put together by David Rosenberg.
But you can pull this from almost anywhere.
And it shows that for the past 30 years, 40 years,
with the major recessions we've had, they've pretty much
all been preceded by a pretty substantial rise
in interest rates.
We hang out for a little bit, and then we
start going into recession.
And largely, the central banks are scrambling
to start cutting rates there.
And usually, there's a pretty big market
downdraft associated with each of those recessions there.
So I think I understand the logic
that you're saying of why you think that there's
actually a bull cycle ahead from here.
But it would kind of mean that things are different this time.
Explain either how I'm reading this chart wrong
or why it is different this time.
Well, I think there's a number of factors.
I mean, one is that this is simply one indicator.
It isn't necessarily what's driving recessions.
I mean, I could equally show you oil prices on that chart.
And there's been a spike in oil prices
ahead of every recession.
What you see now is collapsing oil prices.
So that would actually suggest we're
going to see a strong economy next year, if that's correct.
So I think it depends on the indicator you look at.
I'm not saying that interest rates are not important.
All I'm saying is that they're not the critical factor
that they were.
And the longer you go back in time,
the more important interest rates
were because they're actually affecting capital spending
decisions.
But given the fact that you've got
not that great amount of capital spending going
on in the advanced economies now,
because they're mature economies with lots of excess capacity.
Secondly, you've got debt where the maturity
wall is probably at least two to three years out.
And so corporations don't need to come to the market
to raise money right now.
They've probably got their funding OK.
You know, I would venture that interest rates
are not having the impact that they once did.
So it's really as straightforward as that.
So I would be extremely surprised
if you've got a recession in the US.
You may get a slowdown, but as I recall this,
this looks to me very much like the sort of period
in the early 90s in the US where you've
got what were called rolling recessions in different sectors.
The entire economy never fell into the ditch, so to speak.
And that, interestingly, was in the wake
of the savings alone crisis.
And you might say this one is in the wake
of the regional banking crisis.
So it's not dissimilar.
OK.
And I don't want to put words in your mouth.
So correct this statement.
But we've had a lot of people on this channel,
and just being honest, I've inherited this a lot,
who have been concerned about the lag effect
from the sort of extreme rapidity
by which the central banks raised interest rates
and the cost of debt has gone up.
And I understand what you've said with, hey,
they just don't matter as much as they
used to in terms of their impact on the economy
and financial assets.
But there's been a lot of people saying,
look, the lag effect, it's still going to matter.
And maybe it's getting delayed for a whole bunch of reasons,
including rising liquidity.
I kind of get the vibe from you that you
don't think it's going to really matter that much.
It may express itself in these kind
of rolling recessions you're talking about.
But you're not expecting, if we do stay higher for longer
for a while, you don't really expect
kind of like a wheels come off the economy result
because of the lag effect.
- Not really, no.
I think that we should, I mean, if you look at the lags,
I mean, there may be various reasons why lags are extended,
but we're not really seeing, I don't think,
any great evidence of recession coming.
I mean, there's clearly been a cyclical slowing.
I'd be incorrect to suggest there hasn't.
But I think equally you can cite examples
of US activity picking up.
I mean, it was only a week or so ago
that I think the chairman of the LA Port Authority
was actually citing increasing volumes.
And I think, I mean, I'm not going to misquote him,
but I think he was saying that, you know,
volumes are up 20% on a year ago.
Now that would suggest that there's some inflection going on.
Actually, I mean, we can see that in other port authorities.
Look at what's happening in Singapore as well in China.
And that may be part of this sort of ramping up
of the Chinese economy again.
So I think a lot of these things are consistent.
I'm not saying there won't be a slowdown.
What I'm saying is I don't think
there's going to be a deep recession.
Evidence is something else, which is looking at the numbers
that the Federal Reserve puts out.
Once the New York Fed, I think it may be down the Dallas Fed,
they've taken the data over,
which is basically looking at weekly US activity rates.
They produce an index.
For the last two or three weeks,
that's been accelerating again.
So, you know, it strikes me that the evidence is very mixed,
but I don't think you're getting a recession.
You may be getting a slower economy for sure.
But, you know, from all accounts,
the Federal Reserve is now turning around.
And arguably, it wants the time to boost the economy
through next year by rate cuts.
Okay, so and I'm asking a lot of these questions
just to differentiate your position
from a lot of other folks who've had on here.
So I kind of take from you saying,
yeah, the plane might lose a little bit of altitude
still from here, but I don't think you expect a landing.
Like it's basically, you know,
these net positive capital flows and whatnot
will eventually kick in and win on the net basis.
And the plane will actually start gaining altitude again.
That is my view.
Okay, great to hear that.
So last question on this,
and then I'm going to let you get to whatever chart
you have to sort of explain how you track liquidity,
where you see it right now, where you see it going,
which is when you talk about balance sheet capacity,
is there a limit to that
or a point at which you get diminishing returns?
Can the balance sheets of the banking
and non-banking system with the help of the central banks
or whatnot, can they do this infinitely
or is there a point at which you literally just get
debt saturation or exhaustion
or they just can't keep manufacturing short-term prosperity
by taking on more debt?
Well, I think that's an extremely good point.
I don't fully know the answer to that.
What I would say is unquestionably politicians
and policymakers are kicking the can down the road
because that's the only viable solution
that we can think of in the near term.
And they will do that all the time.
That is how they book bullet number one.
Yeah. But you look at, and I can show you a chart
a little bit later, that if you look at the estimates
that are put out by a combination
of the congressional budget office,
which is obviously a bipartisan body,
and the international monetary fund
on US debt to GDP ratios,
what you're seeing is that on their joint numbers,
250% debt GDP ratio is tested around 2050.
Now, given the fact that we're just above 100% or so now,
this is public debt, that's a way to go.
Now, the last economy, the last major economy
that got into that, I mean, let's say Western economy,
because Japan's clearly been there,
but the last Western economy you've seen in history
that got to those levels of Britain
in the interwar and subsequent post-war periods.
And that high degree of public debt to GDP
was not a great background for the British economy.
There were a whole lot of troubles that emerged.
And I think the thing that concerns me
is that that level of public debt to GDP
will have a lot of untoward effects
on the underlying level of the US economy.
And I think equally,
if you come back to this whole question
about the integrity of the regional banks in the US,
the regional banks are integral to the performance,
the long run performance,
the long run productivity performance of the American economy.
And the longer that you screw down the regional banks
with an inverted yield curve,
the more you're gonna damage the long-term growth trend
of the US economy.
It's not the cycle here that is the important thing,
it's the long-term trend.
I'm a little bit more optimistic about the cycle
because I think fiscal policies, if you like,
lifting the economy upwards at the moment,
but the long-term trend,
the government sector can't do much about
apart from getting out of the way,
but they can't do, it's all about the private sector.
And the private sector depends particularly
on regional banks in the US for lending.
If you start to hammer down those regional banks
for any longer,
it's gonna damage the long-term productivity
performance of the US economy,
which is why I believe that the federal reserve
is very well advised.
And I think they're gonna do that,
try and steepen the yield curve in 2024.
That's why they need to get rates down.
Okay, that's really interesting.
And again, I don't wanna mischaracterize you here,
but what I kind of hear you saying is like,
I'm gonna make you a doctor for a second.
You feel like you can get the patient
out of the hospital bed and walking around again
with some, I don't know, adrenaline defibrillators,
whatever.
You can get them back into a decent state of health
in the short period of time,
but you're still worried about their underlying
chronic condition and it's still maybe terminal, right?
Is that a decent analogy?
Yeah, I think that's right.
I wouldn't like to go as far as say if it's terminal
for the US economy.
I think as we sort of characterize it more loosely
is that the US may be the cleanest shirt in the laundry,
but it's in the laundry.
A lot of others are in much worse shape than America.
But nonetheless, there is an issue that needs to be faced.
And that is that these debt levels are not healthy.
That's for sure.
Yeah, and I, again, don't wanna put words in your mouth,
but I've seen the chart that you're talking about,
the CBO chart, where you just see that the debt
kind of going exponential from here in their projections.
And those are government projections, right?
And one of the worries that I have from it is just
government doesn't have a great track record of projecting.
In other words, it tends to be more optimistic
than what usually plays out.
So would you be taking the under on that 2050 bet?
Oh, absolutely.
I think that it's gonna be potentially worse than that.
But I think the thing that you've got to start thinking
about in the same thought pattern is that debt demands
liquidity and liquidity, if you like, facilitates more debt.
So there's a sort of a vicious spiral between these two
factors. And if you've got a rising debt to GDP ratio,
you've also got a rising liquidity to GDP ratio.
Now, that's what the other issue that we're talking about
here is that debt may be damaging the integrity of the
American economy, but liquidity is having a wholesale effect
on financial markets.
And it requires a major change in asset allocation.
And I would venture, you know, why should you be holding
government bonds or any form of bonds in the medium term
if you're facing a serious monetary inflation?
What you've got to start thinking about is monetary
inflation hedges.
And that's really what's at the heart of this.
OK, monetary inflation hedges are at the heart of this.
OK, so I'm writing that down to revisit with you
at the end of this discussion, which is once we fully
understand liquidity, what do you do about it?
That sounds like probably step number one.
Yeah, absolutely.
OK, all right. Well, look, I've asked most of my questions
to sort of set the stage here.
I know you've got some charts.
We can go any direction you like, but I guess one question
just might be sort of like, where is liquidity right now?
How do you measure it?
Do you have some charts that sort of show where we are?
How do you calculate it?
Like what inputs go into it?
I've seen different charts sort of measuring inflation.
We don't seem to have a standard inflation chart.
I kind of wish we did, given how important it is.
I mean, I think like the Wall Street Journal should
probably just have that chart on the front page every day,
just like the S&P.
I think absolutely good point.
Very good point.
Let me share some slides and then I will try and answer
these questions directly.
So this chart, hopefully, that you can see in front of you
is, if you like, the main spring of our work, which is
looking at the global liquidity index or the global
liquidity cycle.
And what this chart is basically illustrating is in black,
the flow of money through world financial markets.
Now, what we think about is in terms of liquidity is not
these monetary aggregates like M1 or M2 or whatever.
I mean, I've said many times before, they're sort of very
outdated measures that are really gauging the deposit
liabilities of US high street banks.
They're not really meaningful in a world where you've got
global money, global liquidity, and you've got shadow banks
and other forms of borrowing apart from deposits or other
forms of funding apart from deposits.
You need to make a much, much wider or broader assessment
of what liquidity is.
And this is money that is flowing through world financial
markets.
And the black line is an index.
It ranges between 0 and 100.
The dotted line you see on top of that is a sine wave based
on a Fourier analysis for those of you that are mathematical
that we basically put over the top in year 2000, so
approximately 25 years ago.
So what we were doing then was using the data set from 1970
to 2000 to fit that sine wave to the black line.
And we've run it on consistently without alteration thereafter.
So what you see is what you get and what it traces out are
average 65 month cycles.
And that seems to rule the repeating cycle of global
liquidity.
Why that is, I don't know for sure.
I've got various theories as to why you get there, but none
of them are particularly outstanding, if you like, or the
true explanation.
So it's a combination of things.
But what you can see, particularly if you look recently,
is the global liquidity cycle hit a low point about 2018,
2019, rocketed upwards through the COVID crisis.
As you saw, central banks injecting lots and lots and lots
of liquidity.
It then started to crash as central banks reversed course,
and it hit a low point around October of 2023.
And it's picked up thereafter.
Now, there is no question, and I'd be incorrect to say this,
that liquidity is currently low.
It's not high, but it is expanding.
And it will likely, not certainly, but likely trace out
that path as articulated by the dotted line there.
And it will peak around late 2025, if we're correct.
Now, to answer your question about what goes into that and
maybe some of the ingredients, I'm going to flip back in this
slide deck to try and show an earlier chart, which hopefully
will illustrate what I mean by this.
So this is the pool of global liquidity as we define it,
shown on this chart.
It basically illustrates that global liquidity is a pool
of $170 trillion or thereabouts.
It is a measure of the capacity of capital, not the cost
of capital.
And it really matters, as we say, when debt needs to be
rolled over.
And for the record, it's about 1 and 3/4 times the size
of world GDP.
Now, what is it we're actually doing here?
This slide is defining what we mean by liquidity.
The text is probably self-evident.
But broadly, in summary, we're calibrating central bank
interventions in the markets, bank and shadow bank credit
advances, the cash flow of corporations, collateral-based
wholesale and repo market activity, which is a fairly
wonkish idea, but I mean, it's very important in the modern
financial economy, and net cross-border flows.
And essentially, the liquidity measure we look at is really
a wholesale measure that, as I say at the bottom, more or
less starts where conventional definitions of money end.
So this is the important thing that we tend to monitor.
That's the liquidity cycle again in, if you like,
microcosm since 1990.
And what it is illustrating is that the peaks of the liquidity
cycle coincide, as the annotations suggest, with asset
price booms.
And the low points tend to see banking crises.
So what you've got is the low point in the last two dips were
the US repo market tensions in the summer of 2019 and the US
regional banking problems that occurred around the spring of
this year.
And that's quite consistent with what you would typically
find during low points in the cycle.
Now, if we move on somewhat--
Actually, sorry, can you go back to that for one second?
I will, yeah.
Yeah, there's two things I want to note about this.
One is, obviously, this maps really well to what we've seen
in asset prices over the past couple of years, which is, as
liquidity started declining, that basically was 2022.
That's why we had such a bad year in the markets and in stock
markets and bond markets.
I guess even if we go before then, you see the huge rise in
liquidity following the pandemic and all the responses.
And that's what brought asset prices up to all-time highs.
And then the bottom there, US regional bank crisis there,
that is-- I'm guessing that bottomed around October.
You tell me if that's wrong.
The regional banks--
Yeah, the cycle actually bottomed in October, but the
banking crisis was February, March.
Yeah, because it took a little time for the shockwave to head
on over there, right?
And now it's going up.
And based on your previous chart of the sine wave, the
sine wave, if this follows the sine wave, it goes back up
pretty substantially from here for the next year and a half,
two years.
That's why you think financial assets are going to run into
2025. I totally get that.
So that's point number one, which is at least in our recent
living history, this chart is very explainative.
Secondly, when you show that we have banking crises at the
bottoms of these things, this may also go to your point of
interest rates maybe don't matter as much as liquidity,
where folks have been talking about all the discussion when
the Fed started raising interest rates was at what rate
does the economy break, right?
And everybody was worried that the central banks were going
to quote unquote break something by having higher interest
rates.
Your chart seems to show maybe there's some correlation
between liquidity and rates.
But really what matters here is it's a decline in liquidity
that breaks things.
And that's what we should-- if we're worried about things
breaking, we should then be looking maybe much more at
liquidity than interest rates.
Correct. That's what we've been arguing for a long, long time.
I learned when I was at Salomon Brothers that it's liquidity
that really matters.
OK. I just wanted to hammer on that because your chart is
a good visualization of the points that you were making
earlier on.
And as I say, don't take my word for it.
Go and read the writings of Henry Kaufman, who was the
doyen of this whole flow of funds analysis, particularly in
the US economy.
I mean, Henry has written extensively and with great
authority about the risk of financial crisis in the American
economy.
I mean, his books, I'm sure, are still very much in print.
They're definitely worth reading.
All right. Great, great, great point.
And I interrupted you, so I'll let you go on here.
But one question I do want to ask you after we go through
all this is, why are more people not beating the strum,
Michael?
I mean, you make it sound so self-evident and you've got a
lot of great supporting visuals here.
Why are why does liquidity come up so infrequently in these
macro discussions?
Well, I think that that's not I mean, I think there are two
reasons or two things to say.
I mean, one is that there are people out there who look at
liquidity.
I mean, we in many cases, certainly wearing my Salomon
brothers hat, probably pioneered it several decades ago.
But there are other people that find liquidity important.
I think you can find people, for example.
I mean, dangerous talk here, but in the crypto space who
certainly believe that liquidity is the important factor
to watch.
This may be a new generation of investors, but they seem to
have cotton on to the fact that it's very important.
But then if you come back to teaching and this is the whole
question about why people have the views they do is the
economics or traditional economics is not it doesn't teach
this type of stuff.
It teaches traditional textbook stuff where what really matters
in the markets is the rate of interest.
I'm sure as you would attest, I mean, your experience is that
people look at interest rates.
I understand all that, but it isn't necessarily the most
important thing.
Yeah, I'm just shocked and I'm not super shocked that maybe
the mainstream financial media is sort of stuck in the past.
But I talk to a lot of people that are in the whatever you
want to call this space, the alternative financial media
space, fintuit, whatever, where I'd like to think people are
a little bit more open-minded and data-driven and yeah, we'll
talk about liquidity from time to time, but very few make it
the heart of their case and very few will pull up a visual
and say, this is how I'm measuring it and this is where we
are. I'm just surprised because hearing you talk here, it just
sort of sounds like, hey, this should be the thing you start
with and end with and talk a lot about in the middle.
And I interview a lot of people per week.
The points you raise here are raised relatively infrequently,
I'm just going to say. So it just surprises me.
But I think if you go back and look, if you went back to
the late 60s, 1970s and you talked about what's driving
inflation and suddenly Milton Friedman appears and says it's
all about money, there was a period of 10, 15, 20 years where
money was the only thing that then became important in
understanding inflation, but that derailed traditional
economic analysis. But now, since then, economic analysis
has fought its way back into the curriculum. But you could
see that there are fashions and I'm not saying that liquidity
is going to remain in fashion forever, but it's certainly
important right now. I always think you've got to pay
attention to what liquidity is saying.
I've interrupted you. I'll let you go, but I feel like I
should name this video when we release it, something like,
it's all about liquidity stupid, or something like that,
because it just seems so paramount from what you're
saying here. But anyways, I'll let you continue.
So I'm going to go on to a slide just in a second, which
hopefully explains what you were doing with your narrative
earlier. This is looking at the global liquidity cycle in,
this is the period since 2000 again, with, in orange, with
returns on all assets overlaid on top and liquidity
extrapolated out to the end of 2025. Now, there are two
things I'll say about that. First, the definition of all
wealth includes all residential real estate worldwide, which
I get data from the BIS database, Bank for International
Settlements, that is, I look at all bond, bond market
investment products, all equities worldwide, all liquid
asset products, in other words, money market funds or
whatever, precious metals, cryptocurrencies, all add
together into a total portfolio, which comes to about
500 in excess of 500 trillion. And that basically is shown
as the black line in terms of its average, average annual
increases. The orange line is global liquidity. Now, in a
sense, it's a fairly unfair chart, because if I ran it back
from 1970 onwards, you would find a very good correlation
between global liquidity and all wealth, as reported here,
but it wouldn't quite as be as tight as what we see here.
And actually, the correlation has tightened as the years of
advanced. So in other words, for the last 10 years, that
correlation has been remarkably tight, like we've never seen
before. But there we are. And the extrapolation in the
future has a curious dogleg in it, where it looks like it's
going down sort of sharply. That's really a base effect.
That's mathematical or arithmetic. It's not because
liquidity is set to fall, it's because the growth rate which
we show here is dipping back because it was a surge a year
ago. So don't read anything into that. Think about the
underlying trend, which is saying that liquidity is likely
expanding at about eight to 10%. So that's the sort of
returns that you could expect. So that answers, hopefully,
the question about, you know, the correlation of liquidity
and asset classes, there was a very tight correlation. Now,
if I go back to the chart, I was I was going to try and
explain, this is a heat map of what central banks are doing,
there are about 80 central banks on that chart, there is
no, you know, there's nothing about the size or importance,
this is just a collective of all central banks. So the the
Federal Reserve has, you know, exactly the same square as the
or size square as the Bank of Mauritius, for example.
Yeah, it's it's equal weighted, but it gives an impression of
the numbers of central banks that are easing or tightening
green is green for go or easing, and red is red for stop
or tightening. And as the hues change, as we move through the
chart from red towards orange towards yellow towards green,
there is more easing coming on. So you can see maximum
tightness was about the summer of 2022. And we're basically
progressively moving towards that more benign period. And
that's pretty much what we you know, is how we read things
going forward. Now, the other thing to say is, while I'm on
this chart, this is what is happening in the American
economy or with the Federal Reserve. And you know, this is
how we understand what the Fed is doing. We're looking at the
balance sheet, anyone can do this. Okay, we devise this
aggregate, which we called Fed liquidity that came from my
days at Salomon Brothers, but looking at the Fed, but
effectively what the orange line is, is measuring Fed
liquidity. Fed liquidity is basically the liquidity
injections that Fed actions mean for the money markets
how much money the Federal Reserve through its interactions
effectively get put into the money markets. And that's
orange, the red line is the overall size of the balance
sheet. Now, there's absolutely no question the balance sheet
has fallen in the last 12 months, there is absolutely no
question that the Federal Reserve has engaged what it
calls QT by allowing treasuries to roll off the balance
sheet. That is unequivocal. But the fact is, besides that,
underneath that, the amount of liquidity they've injected into
money markets has risen by 17% since the beginning of the
year, which is something like about five to 600 billion US
dollars. And you can see the two points I mark on the graph.
First of all, for the British guilt crisis in September,
which I think was a wake up call for policymakers everywhere
how bad things had got, or could get, and the US regional
banking crisis and Credit Suisse first Boston failure in
March, February, March of 2023, when there was a noticeable
pickup in liquidity, liquidity conditions have expanded
thereafter. If we are correct in assessing that the latest
Fed, the FOMC meeting is signalling that rates will be cut
through next year, I would venture number one, that it
would be unlikely that they would continue their QT policy
at the same rate or even at all, which means there's more
liquidity still going into the market. And secondly, the
reverse repo tranche or programme held on the Federal
Reserve balance sheet, which is technically a withdrawal of
liquidity from the markets will be run down aggressively, as
money market funds basically switch from the feds overnight
account into treasury bills, which are basically term, you
know, term instruments, not overnight, and they will pay a
more attractive interest rate than overnight. So I think that
that will happen. And those are liquidity boosts. And so you're
going to see more liquidity going into the system. But the
fact is, whichever way you cut this Fed liquidity has gone up,
even though headline says they've done QT, but what's
important is liquidity.
That's just such an important point to underline, because I
think the vast majority of people that follow Wall Street
in the markets are thinking that liquidity has been going
down in the US at least based upon the Fed's "tightening
regime". But it's not for your data here. And I'm sorry, you
might have missed this, but if you could just reiterate it,
what exactly is the Fed doing that is increasing liquidity
here since the beginning of 2023? I'm guessing the BTFP
helped. We saw that huge spike there right around the banking
crisis. What else have they been doing?
Well, it's been factors like, I mean, whether one attributes
that directly to the Federal Reserve, or whether one says
it's Janet Yellen, you know, operating via the Treasury
General Account. I mean, I think those are sort of moot
points. But at the end of the day, you know, if the argument,
which is some people put this argument that actually it's not
the Fed, it's the Treasury who's doing this. But you know,
that opens up a whole can of worms, because the Federal
Reserve is supposedly independent. So the Treasury
shouldn't be affecting things in that way. But the fact is
that the Federal Reserve oversees the amount of liquidity
that goes into money markets, that's its job. And therefore,
it needs to, you know, control its liquidity injections. It
could be it's one of the factors that's been very important, as
you say, has been the bank term funding programme. Another
factor has been the rundown of the reverse repo account on the
Fed's balance sheet, which was basically money that was, that
was, if you like, siloed on the Fed balance sheet paying
interest to the money market funds when there was an absence
of Treasury bills in the system. Now Treasury bills are coming
through in spades, what you're seeing is a significant
drawdown of that of that account. And you've also got the
Treasury general account, which has fluctuated, admittedly, it
did go down, but it's now come up again to about 700 billion.
But the these are sort of, you know, aside factors, but
generally, the balance sheet or the liquidity inducing part has
gone up. The other thing which has helped as well is the
Federal Reserve is making losses on its bond portfolio, because
it's basically receiving less interest than it's paying out.
And as it pays out more than it receives, that's actually
liquidity that's going into the markets.
Okay, super interesting there. Okay, great. That's really
helpful. It just helps us understand the individual
components that are driving that increase there.
And what this chart here is doing is this like taking a
reference cycle, which is looking at what the Federal
Reserve did in the 97 to 2003 period, using our own in house
liquidity index of the Federal Reserve, which is the black
dotted line. So that's the reference cycle, beginning in
1997, ending in 2003. And we've overlaid on top the current
cycle of where the Federal Reserve has been operating since
2019. And you can see it's pretty much a, you know, the
same path, except for the last four or five months, where the
Fed has gone off track. And I think it needs to catch up. And
I think that's what Jay Powell and Co. pretty much indicated
at the last FOMC, they need to get on with the job, they need
to get rates down, they need to get the yield curve steeper,
and they need to get more liquidity pushed into the
economy. And I think this is where the cycle is. They've
been, you know, if you look at the inflation data on the way
that we look at it, at least, I think they've been remarkably
successful. And arguably, they've done a better job than
Volcker did in the early 1970s. And I rest that statement on
the fact that, you know, if you look at the persistence of
inflation through the pricing structure, it's actually
disappeared at a much faster rate this cycle than it did in
the early 1980s under Volcker. So I think they've done a very
good job in terms of getting inflation down. I don't think
there is a serious long term inflation problem in the
American or any other economy worldwide.
Can I ask a question related to that? Could that be in perhaps
kudos to Pal and the team to kind of manage the whole thing,
but could that be the difference between the 70s is we
had a real supply shock this time, right, where we had
supply chains that just froze up, you know, for a period of
time where you couldn't get product that pushed prices high
because of the scarcity, but that has largely been mended
now. And so a huge part of the inflationary issue wasn't
even monetary. I mean, it was once the central banks and the
fiscal side got involved, but it wasn't, it wasn't 100% of the
inflation issue and a good chunk of it was due to these
supply issues that are now gone.
Exactly. Correct. Exactly. Yeah. And if you contrast, if you
want a sort of interesting thought exercise, compare what
America or Europe did with what China did. And if you look at
what happened through the COVID crisis, that was a negative
supply shock. What America and Europe did was to boost demand.
So if you look at the implications of that through
simple supply demand analysis, prices must go up, which they
did. Okay, if you look at what China did, what China did
through that supply shock is actually tighten policy for
other reasons, because the yuan currency was under great
pressure. And what you'd have expected there was actually an
output adjustment downwards. So the economy should have
slowed markedly with some deflation. And that's exactly
what you've had been between the two continents.
Interesting. Not for this discussion, but I'd love to kind
of analyze for you, if we could go back in time, what, if
anything, you would have done differently in that situation,
but that's pulling us off of liquidity. So let's let you
finish your slides. Yeah. So anyway, this is what the Fed's
got to do. And I'm going to, this, by the way, is a chart
which is saying which central banks or are central banks
easing. This is just a metric which shows the amount of
liquidity that central banks are issuing in their markets in
orange. This is weighted by size. And the dotted black line
is the percentage of central banks that are now running
easier policies. So one third of central banks worldwide now,
so that's counting everything at this sort of 80, 90 central
bank sample that we monitor are actually currently easing
policies. And that's the thing to the cycle is turning is
turned up that that is the key thing. Now, what I was that was
that chart, an equal weighted chart that says 30% are using or
is that a dotted line is equally weighted. The orange line is
size weighted. Okay. So it is important to note that size
weighted or market weighted, if you will, liquidity is
increasing across the globe here. Correct. Correct. Now,
what I'm going to do is move on to this analysis, which is
basically how we see the world going in the future. And this
is looking at the global liquidity cycle. This is our
standard asset allocation framework, which is looking at
liquidity as that orange cycle. We split that into four regimes
that we call generically turbulence, rebound, calm and
speculation. The red line is the economic or risk cycle,
which tends to lag that. And the red splodge on there, the red
dot is inflections in yield curves. This is what you'd
expect slightly after the inflection in the liquidity
cycle, the yield curve in flex, then turn otherwise the bond
market is the first financial market ready to respond. And
then you start to get the economy responding afterwards.
This is why liquidity and markets lead the real economy.
So you never forecast financial markets from the economy,
rather vice versa. Now, if we move on to what you'd expect to
see at this stage of the cycle, consider this slide, Adam, what
it shows is on the left hand side, asset classes, and on the
right hand side, industry groups. The red, the red green
amber lodges there, splodges are traffic lights thinking that
way. And we are in the first column of each block in rebound.
That's what we call this phase of the investment cycle,
liquidity, inflecting upwards early stages. So in rebound,
what you'd have expected, and this, by the way, is based on
historic experience is not what you're seeing currently
necessarily, is what history tells you always happens in a
rebound. You want to take your risk, amber, so you can take a
bit of risk, you got to be careful, proceed with caution.
You want to be overweight equities and credits, you want
to be underweight commodities and bond duration. That's what
the cycle should tell you this year was all about. And I would
argue that's more or less what we've seen. On the right hand
side, if you're in rebound, you should be overweight cyclicals,
overweight technology, and underweight defensive stocks.
And that's more or less been correct, okay? As we move on
transition to calm, you want to be more risk on, you want to
have keep your equities, pay your credits a little bit,
start to build up commodities instead, but don't take any bond
duration. And then in stocks, industry groups, you want to
keep with cyclicals, keep with technology, start to move into
financials and start to build up positions in energy, but
remain underweight defensives. Now, if we're correct, and I
say if there's always a health warning with these analyses,
but if we're correct, you should start to see financials
beginning to outperform and energy stocks getting a bid and
commodity markets beginning to lift off if this is correct.
And that's what we're looking for for that consistency
within the framework. Now, a piece of evidence, and I'm going
to move on to a chart a little bit later here. So this chart is
actually this same data, which you saw earlier for the global
liquidity cycle, which has actually been narrowed down to
the US in orange. So it's this US component. And the black line
is the average US yield curve. Now, this is without dancing on
the head of a pin and saying, is this the 210 spread, the three
month, 10 year? Is it the five year, 10 year? This is the
average US yield curve, which in the literature is called the
intensity of the term structure. And this basically shows that
liquidity has been advanced by nine months, and it is leading
the slope of the yield curve. So what we'd expect is as
liquidity cycle picks up, the yield curve begins to steepen.
And that's exactly what we think is going on right now. Now, if
you hold that thought, and you consider that Jay Powell and
colleagues will want to get the front end of the term structure,
i.e. policy rates down by probably the market is now
expecting 100 basis points or so next year, and the yield curve
steepens, the outlook for the long end of the market is not
going to be that favourable. And therefore, we still think
holding bond duration is not a great idea in this environment
where liquidity is expanding again. But we may be unusual in
that regard. But hey, that's the nature of things.
All right. Where bond yields are headed is one of the more
debated issues, I would say, of the folks that have had on this
program. I'd almost kind of put it 50/50. Some say it's great
time to go long duration. Some say it's not. Definitely put
you in the not camp. But you're not certainly alone in there.
Right. And what I want to do right now is just to focus on
the longer term. And I want to show you a couple of charts,
which hopefully will explain this backdrop. This chart here
is looking at a very wonkish concept that I'm not going to
go into in great detail. But it's a component of bond
markets, which is very, very important to understand, which
is like the risk premia on bonds, or actually, as it's
called the term premia, because it's basically applies to the
term structure, the far end of the term structure. It's what
affects bond market returns. And that is the black line. And the
higher that black line, the more yield premium that you're going
to start to bake into the bond markets. So in other words, if
that black line goes up, it's not good news for a bond holder,
okay? Because it's saying interest rates are going up at
the long end. And the orange line is a measure of the amount
of collateral, if you like, that is being supplied into the
markets by the US authorities, in other words, coupon issuance.
And what we've subtracted from this is the normal buying of
foreign investors of US debt, and that in itself may be
problematic. But nonetheless, the orange line is a marker to
say, this is the likely supply of coupon debt in the markets.
And this is a growth rate, as you see on the right hand
slide. Now, the bottom line here is that coupon supply,
Treasury bond issuance is going up at a faster clip. And that is
going to be pushing interest rates up at the long end of the
market. And that is what we have argued is likely to cause
monetary inflation. And here is why, okay? This is the long term
picture of effective supply of collateral in black, taken from
the Congressional Budget Office forecast, which in itself may
be conservative. The orange line is the same CBO estimates of
what the Federal Reserve would take up of that coupon supply.
So I've called it net liquidity injection into the markets.
That's what it is. But there is a very clear divergence between
those two lines. I think that is impossible. I think the Federal
Reserve has to keep up its buying pace, because there won't
be many other buyers, and they will seek to try and keep
interest rates low by buying as much long dated debt as they
can. Or if you like, I'm not gonna say cheating, but you know
what I mean by manipulating the markets through excessive bill
issuance, which is what's going on now. That is important. And
what it means is that the hurdle you've got to jump in the US,
which is the chart that I foreshadowed earlier on is this
one. This is not our data is data that comes from the IMF and
the Congressional Budget Office. And it shows in orange, the debt
GDP ratio prospectively of the US economy out to 2050. Okay, it
tests 250%. The red dotted line is Britain over the same period
from 1800, or just thereafter, right through until, again, 2050.
But the British data is not quite as extensive. But it does
show very neatly the fact that in the 1930s, 40s, 50s, and 60s,
the British economy, the time when its economy started to
seriously underperform the rest of the world had a very, very
high debt to GDP ratio. That debt to GDP ratio was
progressively brought down by high inflation. And it was
brought down again by Thatcher's government, restraining
government spending. But the fact is that Britain's very bad
economic performance coincided with high public debt to GDP,
it's not a good sign. What this chart is saying is there's a
challenge for the US, how does the US afford this high amount
of debt to GDP? And the answer basically means they've got to
start creating liquidity. This chart here is saying, history
tells us that the ratio between debt and liquidity for the
advanced economies worldwide is nearly constant at 250%. So in
other words, for every $25 you have in debt, you need $10 of
liquidity. It's that straightforward. And that means
that liquidity has to start increasing as well. Now, the
convenient point is that if you look at our projections of the
Federal Reserve balance sheet, what that shows is the Fed
balance sheet has to start ramping up significantly to
start taking on some of this debt. And that is the source of
liquidity that the system is getting. The orange bars are the
Congressional Budget Office figures, the grey bars are our
estimates, assuming defence spending, which goes up to 5% of
GDP, and a halt to QT, the current QT, because rate cuts
start to get put in. And that shows how much the Fed balance
sheet can expand. And if you think the previous peak was
about just over 8 trillion, we're going to surpass that,
probably easily by 2026. So we're firing again on all
cylinders of an expanding Fed balance sheet. Don't say that
won't happen because the Congressional Budget Office
itself, the bipartisan body, has also got this pencilled in an
expanding Fed balance sheet. The numbers above the bars are the
percentage increases. But the important point is that it's not
the balance sheet that matters, it's Fed liquidity, the number
within that. And that's the expansion in Fed liquidity that
we that we reckon is coming. And those double digit rates of
expansion are effectively a monetary inflation that is
underway. I'm not hitting on the US because as I said before, the
US is the cleanest shirt in the laundry, okay, others are in
worse shape. But this is what's happening. And I think the
dollar as a paper currency will outperform the euro and other
paper units. But it may not outperform monetary hedges,
dedicated monetary hedges, which I come on to. If you don't think
our numbers are correct, take the CBO numbers in orange, or
take a halfway house. But the numbers still look very, very
worrying, whichever one you take. Now, if you're going to
move on here, I'm going to skip through China and skip through
the dollar. And I'm going to come to this, this chart here.
This is looking at the correlation between the price of
gold and global liquidity, global liquidity is an orange,
and the black line is the growth rate in the price of gold over a
three month span. And liquidity has been advanced here. For
those people that are statisticians or wonkish in that
regard, there is a statistical analysis bottom called a
Grainger causality test, which looks when it decides whether
gold is the leading indicator of liquidity or liquidity is the
leading indicator of gold. And it comes down unequivocally to
say that over a six month span, liquidity drives gold higher.
And that's what it's basically saying gold is a brilliant
monetary inflation hedge. Gold is not a high street inflation
hedge is a monetary inflation hedge. The subtle difference is
that high street prices embrace both monetary inflation, the
devaluation of paper money, and costs like higher or lower oil
prices or productivity gains or taxes or whatever. Okay, that's
not what we're talking about. We're talking about monetary
inflation, devaluation of paper money by central banks. And that
is what gold is the most brilliant hedge at. This is the
long term picture. Going back to 1975. The orange line is the
stock of gold added to that crypto. And I've said, let's
consider for a moment that things like Bitcoin are also
monetary inflation hedges, and that the market capitalization
of crypto to that of the market capitalization of gold and chart
it as the orange line. The black line is our measure of global
liquidity extrapolated to the end of 2025. And you can see
whether that's a decent or not relationship, essentially,
they're moving in the same trend. And I think it's a fairly
decent guide. If you think monetary inflation is picking up,
then the gold price is going to go up, and Bitcoin is going to
go up. And some people, you know, I've even done it myself
in sight tongue in cheek called Bitcoin exponential gold,
because it's very, very sensitive to liquidity. For the
record, the dotted line at the bottom is US CPI inflation.
Since 1995, gold has gone up five times, global liquidity has
gone up five times, and US consumer prices have gone up two
times. So gold is a monetary inflation hedge, not necessarily
a high street inflation as it may be better than high street
inflation, who knows. But that's the story. And that's why we
think if you look forward, more liquidity is coming. It's coming
cyclically, because the Federal Reserve is going to start easing
in the next few months. It's going to add to liquidity. It's
coming because in the medium term, it's the only way out of
this debt problem. You've got to start monetizing the debt. And
that's the reality.
All right. What's so interesting about this is, again, it
explains the price action of gold and Bitcoin over 2022,
right, where we had CPI jump up to 9%, and yet gold was pretty
flat for the year. So folks were pretty disappointed who had
bought gold in anticipation of high inflation, because they're
like, oh, my goodness, we got super high inflation now, and
gold's not really going anywhere. And of course, Bitcoin
got walloped throughout 2022. But if you look at it in terms
of liquidity, well, liquidity was decreasing in that year,
right? And now that liquidity is back on the upturn, Bitcoin has
more than doubled, right? And gold is at all-time highs now,
or has touched all-time highs. So again, yeah, that correlation
you're talking about, we've definitely seen that script play
out in the past 12 months.
I agree.
24 months, yeah.
Yeah. So the story is that next year should be a decent year.
And as we say, look at how markets operate. I mean,
basically, if the business outlook goes from ghastly to
just bad, you make most of your money in markets traditionally.
And if the market environment goes from excellent to just
good, that's when you lose most money. And I think if you look
at where we are on the spectrum, we're probably moving from what
was ghastly, partly in the time of COVID, to what maybe people
would argue is now just bad economically, but that's actually
when you make a lot of money, and you lose your money when it
goes from excellent to just good. And I think we're a long,
long way from being excellent, but we're probably still in the
bad phase. So that suggests to me that cycle-wise, this is not
a bad time to be investing.
It sounds like you think it's a really good time to be
investing. So let's talk about that for a second, because
there's kind of two things that we've talked about here. One is
you're saying, look, there's a secular trend going here of
higher liquidity over the next couple of decades. And there
you're saying that's going to be hand in hand with monetary
inflation for the reasons you just mentioned. And so you need
to have dedicated monetary hedges. So you put gold in that.
It sounds like you put Bitcoin in that as well. Then there's
kind of the cycle like you're talking about. And I believe
that's back to your stoplight slide that you showed us, right?
So remind me of the four phases of the stoplight. There's--
Well, we think of four phases of the cycle, which is basically
rebound, what we then call calm, speculation, and then
turbulence. Those are the four phases that we tend to think of.
So we're in rebound right now, which is where you said that's
where you tend to make your biggest gains, where you go from
ghastly to pretty good. So obviously, for folks that are
watching-- and folks, if you're listening on a podcast and you
didn't see that chart, you've got to find your way to the
YouTube channel to see that chart because I think it's super
important to understand what Michael thinks is going to
happen. He basically shows you, OK, these are the different
asset classes and sectors you want to be in, given where we
are right now in rebound. How do you help people think about
this? In other words, you laid out in your stoplight chart,
hey, if you want to play the rebound, these are the ways to
think about positioning. You had commodities on that chart,
which were red in the rebound. I'm going to assume gold and
Bitcoin might be a little bit different than your average
commodity for the lens that you look through. But is this one
of the great times to be in gold and Bitcoin? Or are you
saying you should have that in your portfolio as sort of a
long-term position to weather the next couple of decades?
Oh, I think cyclically the gold is getting a bid now and so is
Bitcoin. And I think for the reasons the liquidity cycle is
turning up. But I think that my argument for holding both those
assets in portfolios is a long-term argument because I
think we're going to get more monetary inflation. Now, let me
just emphasise, more monetary inflation doesn't necessarily
mean that high street prices will be going up fast. I mean,
it's logical to assume they will, but it's not necessarily
the case because you've got to add into the equation what's
happening to costs. But if you get massive cost deflation, and
that could arise because, for example, China devalues the
renminbi significantly, or oil prices collapse, or there's a
productivity miracle or something like that, all those
factors could actually dent consumer price inflation,
irrespective of what monetary inflation is doing. So I think
you've got to differentiate the two. But I'm arguing here is
that gold and Bitcoin are protections against the monetary
authorities worldwide devaluing credit money or paper money. And
that that's really the point, you've got to have it in
portfolios, because that has to be in the name of the game. And
I think if you reflect on where we are in the political cycle,
the COVID crisis was the first ever crisis that we faced,
where spending was not funded by tax increases or increasing
debt, it was funded by basically printing money. And that's, I
think, a heads up, ask the question, whether it be Biden,
or whether it be Trump, in 2024. Is either of those going to
raise taxes, I think, highly unlikely. And you can say
exactly the same for Europe, if you start to, if you're a
politician, and you your manifesto says, I'm going to
raise taxes, just forget it. No one's in that game. So
effectively, they're going to kick the can down the road,
which means more monetization, whatever they may say now.
Okay, we're gonna have to leave it there. Michael, I'm just
looking at the time here. We've gone more than 10 minutes over
the hour. So I failed in trying to keep this to a respectful
timeframe for you. And even just your last point there, I
feel like I could talk with you for another hour or two on that
question, plus a whole number of questions written down here
that we just can't get to today. But Michael, this has
been wonderful. Love to invite you back on the program anytime
you want to come on. But if I can kind of publicly commit you
here, when you think we are moving from rebound to calm,
love to have you come back on here just so folks know, hey,
it's time to switch from one set of stoplights to another
set. Really important question for folks that have really
enjoyed this discussion. Maybe this is the first time they're
being exposed to your work. And Michael, I'm sure you made
the vast majority of the viewers here today really
think in a way they haven't been thinking of late. And so
anyways, if those folks want to follow you in your work, where
should they go? Well, if you want to read up on what we do
from a more theoretical point of view, there was a book I wrote
about three or four years ago called Capital Wars that's
published by Palgrave. And it's available on Amazon. I mean,
hopefully these days at a discount. So that's one avenue.
The second thing is we have a substack with the same name,
which is called Capital Wars, which is written up probably at
least twice a week containing data and analyses. And our
website is crossbordercapital.com and the
Twitter handle is @crossbordercap. So that's the
array of channels that you can tune into. Fantastic. And
Michael, when I edit this, I will put up overlays to each of
those assets. Folks, I'll also put links in the description
below too, so you can get one-click access to them. And
folks, if you too would like to see Michael come back when he's
got an update for us, please encourage him to do so by
hitting the like button, then clicking on the red subscribe
button below as well as that little bell icon right next to
it. Michael, this has been great. Concluding question for
you, this is something that I've been asking a number of my
guests recently and folks have really been enjoying it. You've
taken us through just a really fascinating mental exercise
here on the financial side of things and told us how you
think people should consider positioning given your
financial outlook. Putting money aside for a second, is
there a non-financial investment that you would encourage
people to consider making in their lives, one that you
think is either create a lot of value for you or just in
kind of looking at the world thinking, "Oh, if people do more
of this, it'd be a better place for them." Yeah, I mean,
interesting point to ponder, Adam. I would say, I mean,
number one must be invest in your health. I think that's
the most important investment anyone can make. I think invest
time in books and particularly history books. I wouldn't waste
time with economics books. I'd look at history books, economic
history books, because that's going to tell you an awful lot
about what has happened in the past. And I think if you want
both an investment that might make you money, an investment
that will actually help your sanity, invest in art. Because
even if the price of art goes down, you can still enjoy some
great, great pictures. So I think I'd look in those areas.
All right, great. Fantastic answer. Well, thank you so much,
Michael. Like I said, you're welcome back on the program
anytime. It's been absolutely wonderful. Thank you.
That's great. Thank you. Much enjoyed, Adam. Thank you.
All right. Well, now is the time with the program where we
bring in the lead partners from New Harbor Financial, one of the
endorsed financial advisory firms by Thoughtful Money to
react to what Michael just said there and also give us any
update they think is germane to what's going on in the markets
over the past week. I'm joined as usual by John Loder and Mike
Preston. Guys, thanks so much for joining. Let's see. Mike,
why don't we start with you this time? In some ways, pretty
mind-blowing, what we just talked about with Michael, which
was sort of like, look, liquidity is the thing and
everything else is secondary or distant tertiary factor. And we
just got to look at where liquidity is heading and that
really is going to tell the tale. And in Michael's outlook,
liquidity is going to keep rising for the foreseeable
future. So even though stocks have partied hard into the end
of 2023 here, he expects 2024 to be a pretty good year, at
least until the liquidity situation changes. So, curious
to get your take and also guys, as we talk here, would love to
get a sense for how, if at all, you take the liquidity
situation into your portfolio allocation decisions there at
New Harbor. Well, thank you, Adam. Liquidity is important.
Michael talked a lot about liquidity, obviously, and he's
pretty bullish and certainly like his optimism. When he
answered your first question, what his viewpoint was on the
global economy and markets, he said he's broadly positive and
upbeat. And I would say that we are probably two in the very
near term, but we have overriding concerns that it's
certainly about valuations and other things that keep us very
cautious. And maybe that's a curse of looking at the data or
looking at the data that we look at versus the data that
Michael looks at. But Michael talks about the global
liquidity index, and he presents a lot of different
charts that are pretty compelling. There was one chart
that he showed that showed that the global liquidity index
bottoms in October of 2022. And it's been moving higher since,
and it's certainly hard to argue that the market hasn't
been moving higher. What I don't understand, and perhaps I
just need to do a little more reading and research on this,
is exactly how is the index constructed? How is liquidity
measured? It's not easy. He talked about a number of
different things about liquidity increasing because of the
reversal of the bank term financing program or the rollout
of that and the reversal of the repo program. We're starting to
unwind that. It's difficult to understand the details of the
data. And again, it's probably my own ignorance of how the
index is constructed, but I want to know exactly how is that
measured. And there is some empirical evidence that shows
that liquidity itself in a vacuum doesn't really push up
markets. So the Fed has been easing or was easing in the
past bear markets after the housing market breakdown in
2008, 2009, and also during the tech bust. But the markets
continue to go down even with more liquidity and more easing.
So overall, I think that we agree that the technicals in
the market look very strong near term. Now, this market has
defied almost all odds and moved in a straight line. It was a
record close, I think nine or 10 record closes yesterday for
the Dow. The S&P has been on a tear. Small caps and mid caps
have started to join the party. All of the things that we're
noticing and we've been talking about every week. So near term,
we agree that things look bullish, but I don't know
exactly how to use that in day to day action on the portfolio
level, at least for us. There's a lot of other things we look
at, near term technicals, relative strength, bullish
charts, but always we're really concerned about the big
picture as we know at some point that matters. And so my
question after watching that video is, okay, if liquidity
continues and continues to increase, then what? What's the
end game of all of this? Because he talks about the fact that the
debt has to be monetized. Well, that's true. He talked about the
fact that I think it was, I wrote it down here somewhere,
$350 trillion in debt. $350 trillion in debt and five year
average maturity. It's like $70 trillion a year have to be
rolled over. It's pretty crazy. And so what's the end game of
all of this? And that's, you know, maybe we're just in a new
era that we're still figuring out the rules, but, and this is
what the Fed has created. You know, we all have to kind of
create new variables and new ways to look at things, but the
fundamentals and the valuations are not going to be wrong
long-term. And so we all have to think about what the end game
is here. And that's what we're concerned about. Yeah. And
that's, that's kind of the crux that that was sort of the, the
sacred cow, if you will, but I think Michael was maybe, you
know, targeting with his spear there, which is maybe valuations
don't really matter in this new world where liquidity flows
really, you know, determine the fate of everything. So, you know,
a couple of things. So how this all ends, just want to
underscore what Michael had said, which is, you know, he
said, look, you got to get monetary inflation hedges, right?
And I know that you guys at New Harbor are, you know, gold is a
core part of your portfolio. That's definitely a big part of
Michael's long-term portfolio as well. He also likes Bitcoin.
But, but essentially for this reason, right, that the central
banks are just going to keep monetizing and basically
destroying the purchasing power of the currency. To your point,
Mike, about like, you know, how do we measure this? That, that,
that to me is the most interesting part is there are
all these different charts out there on the internet measuring
liquidity in different ways. I'd say if there was a new piece
to the puzzle that Michael brought to me, was that in his
definition of liquidity, it really was more balance sheet
capacity, right? It's not necessarily like capital flowing
into the market at any given moment in time. It's the ability
of the system to take on more debt, right? And he said,
there's, there's still a fair amount of, of, of ability out
there. And of course the Fed has just taken a trillion off of
its balance sheet. There's no reason it couldn't turn around
and add a trillion, you know, right back, right? Also as, as
on the corporate side, as, as prices continue to rise
aggressively, like they are well, debt to equity ratios go
down, which give them, you know, legitimacy to go out and raise
more debt if they want to and their capital structure. So that
was a really interesting piece to the puzzle, but, but John,
I'm going to go to you now, you and I were talking right before
we turn the camera on here and you were talking about the
transmission mechanism of liquidity which you have to
understand that, like, as Mike said, liquidity in a vacuum,
it's not as simple as higher liquidity, all boats rise, even
though oftentimes it kind of looks that way. You have to
actually have a way for that liquidity to get transmitted
out into the system to do what it needs to do. And
potentially you can get into a situation where liquidity is
going up, but it's not really having that much of an impact.
That's that sort of famous pushing on a string scenario.
So expound a little bit more on, on, on that and just sort of
your general views on liquidity too. Yeah. So I, I too found
Michael's discussion very, very informative. I'm really
appreciative that he brings a deeper level of this concept of
liquidity because there are a proliferation of very simple
definitions that make for great charts out in the internet, but
are quite misleading. Yeah. I can't tell you how many charts I
saw over earlier this year, showing a chart of like M2 money
supply across the world and plotting it on a chart with the
S and P 500. And there, you know, over the summer, there
was this jaw that opened up basically implying that one or
the other had to give either liquidity had to be injected or
the S and P had to pull back. And the problem with that, I
saw a fabulous discussion. I wouldn't call a debate between
Michael Howell and another widely respected and followed
strategist, Andy constant. And I think you may wish to get him
on your program. So maybe he, I think he'd be a great guest for
you. And perhaps even a conversation with, with Andy and
Michael, they're both, as I understand, both Solomon
brothers alumni. Anyways they both have critiqued some of
those, those charts, you know, and those charts are rife with
what we call chart crimes, different, you know, slice of
hand that oftentimes make a chart look correlated, but, but
really not. But, but I really appreciated this notion of, of
balance sheet capacity, and that is a transmission mechanism.
And the one thing I would like to add, I wish more than a
critique of Michael's comments, more of a question and maybe a
follow on discussion with him, our sense, and we've seen it in
practice all the time. You, you, you mentioned the, the, the
notion of the fed pushing on the string and really what that
speaks to is when you have a system, whether it's an economic
economic system, a market, there's this notion of binding
constraints, that there's something that's in short supply
relative to demand for it. You know, the market, the, the
economy wants more credit, but there's a shortage of that
credit. But there, there are times where those constraints
are not binding and adding more of something doesn't transmit
anymore because there's already a surplus. So let me give a
couple of examples and that, that fed pushing on the string,
when there's enough, you know, fed liquidity in the system,
them adding more, the notion of pushing on the string is it
doesn't do anything. It doesn't transmit any additional
benefits. It just kind of finds its way and piles up in the
economy. And you might, I think rightly say that's what
happened in spades over the last decade. Plus, you know, a
massive amount of reserves. John Hussman has talked about
this notion of a liquidity preference curve. Right now,
that's, there's about 28% of GDP in fed-based reserves,
reverse repo and, and, and credit that could be cut in, in
by, by 75% and still not have a material impact on, on the
short-term treasury rate. That that's what this, this curve
speaks to. In other words, there's way too much reserves in
the system. I might point to the banking crisis earlier this
year in the spring. Basically what happened there, banks had
you know, way more liquidity than they, they, they wanted
and needed yet. They didn't have the demand for, for loans.
They had plenty of balance sheet capacity to lend out
money, but the demands for, for credit was not there. So what
they do, they went and bought treasury built bonds, long-term
treasury bonds at really low interest rates, which is just
another form of lending instead of lending to a commercial
property developer or a business looking to expand, they
lent to the U S government and boy, what, what a problem that
turned out to be. So, you know, I think that's maybe a really
good example of, yeah, there's plenty of liquidity, but if
there's not demand for that liquidity in the system, in the
balance sheets and the economic engine of the system, it, it
doesn't transmit in the form. And, and the bottom line is our
discipline. We're very mindful and very cognizant about big
picture evaluations and things like that. And we'll never let
our guard down about those kinds of things, but we let the
market speak to us. Michael himself said many times the
commentaries have it wrong. They look to the economy to, to
lead the market. And we see it the other way. We look at price
trends and price action as a, at least in a short-term sense, a,
a predictor of, you know, perhaps the economy. But that's
a very short term because markets are notoriously bad at
predicting recessions. If you look at a chart of the S and P
by wonder always peaks right before a recession, right? So
those are some of the key takeaways I have. I think the
real critical piece and Andy constant made this point in the,
in the discussion. I see, you know, you got to take that
liquidity, but also kind of focus on the transmission and,
and risk across different asset classes, not just stocks. We're
talking about here, it's bonds, it's commodities, and it's the
interplay between those that really matters. You can't say
the S and P is going to go up just because there's more, more
liquidity. It's not quite that simple in our, in our
assessment. Okay. So let's get down to the rubber meeting, the
road here, which is I'm looking at a lot of the folks that have
come on this channel recently, and I'm now sort of beginning to
see three to the camps. You've got the Felix Zulaufs and the
Darius Dales on one side who say, look, history shows, like
you just said, John, you know, the market parties, it's
hardest, you know, right up before it has a big correction,
right? And when Felix was on the channel, you know, he
basically said he can see the market powering higher through
Q1. You know, he had picked 5,000 at this rate. Looks like
we might get there a lot sooner than the end of Q1. But he said
that's going to be a top tick. And then for a bunch of other
reasons we discussed in that interview, he thinks that the
S and P is going to have a pretty severe correction. You
know, he said it could be as much as 40%, you know, ending
40% lower from the high at the end of 2024, right? Darius
Dale, I think has a somewhat similar outlook. I don't know
what size correction he's looking for later in the year.
I'm going to have him on the program in early January, so
we'll find out soon. But I'm interviewing him just two days
from now, so we'll know really soon. But, you know, he does
expect kind of like, you know, a rager, you know, a melt up in
the markets that gets everybody piled in. And then of course,
there's the rug pull, right? So, I would call that one camp,
the camp of the rug pull. The second is, you know, John
Hussman, we show his forward projected returns chart on this
channel a lot. I was talking to Cameron Dawson the other day.
She has sort of a similar concern that we just might be
looking at a set of series of lost years ahead of us, right?
Where the market kind of goes nowhere because valuations have
been pulled in today by this exuberance that we're seeing.
So, that's just one where, you know, your projected returns
look really disappointing, you know, not terrible, but just,
you know, you're losing purchasing power by not growing
your wealth. And then the third camp is guys like Howell,
right? Michael Howell, where he thinks we're in rebound, right?
And we're going to have a great two years from here. You know,
the economy is going to grow, markets are going to keep
powering higher for the next two years. So, you've got, you
know, these three very distinct possibilities here and very
smart people who can argue for each one. Nobody has a crystal
ball. Nobody knows what's going to happen for sure. So, how do
you guys, how are you guys positioning right now, keeping
in mind the potential possibilities of these outcomes?
John, why don't we start with you and then Mike will go to
you because I also want to talk about gold a little bit here if
we got time. Sure. A couple of quick comments on it. So, yeah,
we agree that whether we're talking about a follow through
rally that lasts for another couple of days or a couple of
months or even a couple of years, that the decade ahead is
likely to look very, very disappointing from a, I want to
emphasize a passive buy and hold investment approach because
what we expect is a likely scenario is we're going to get a
major pullback, major crash even. And it's from those
events from which a bleak picture long-term that exists
right now becomes a very positive picture. And it's all
about avoiding those big declines. So, our approach right
now is very balanced. We have, you know, we're definitely
underweight stocks compared to most traditional advisors, but
we're overweight in areas that are better valuations, better
relative strength. So, we're trying to pick the horses that
are leading this charge. John, just to be clear, you guys have
been adding to, you've been increasing your stock exposure
over Q4, right? Yeah, in a very measured way. We use hedging
tools. We use options in very conservative hedging ways. So,
for example, the day before last, I think last week's Fed
meeting, we added about 10% notional exposure to broad
equal weight S&P index. We did so by buying call options. That
essentially is the financial equivalent of buying that index
and buying a put option, a downside hedge. And it just
happens that volatility is very low right now. So, that
embedded insurance is very cheap. So, we're able to add
some exposure to capture some follow-through upside which so
far has happened. But we have this line in the sand that the
market could collapse and we, you know, clients wouldn't be,
you know, really that harmed because of the essentially the
embedded put option there. And, you know, we sell call
options at opportune times. I'll just share a chart here
right now because as positive as near-term indicators are, I do
want to make the point that we're getting very stretched on
the short term. This is a chart. It's called the point and
figure chart. And basically, what is the S&P 500 SPX and
it's what's referred to as a 10-week chart. It's basically a
50-day moving average and the range around that in terms of
overbought oversold. And basically, you see right here,
we're about 88%. 100% is two standard deviations. So, rarely
do we get this high. And in fact, the last several times we
did, you see a pullback. A column of those is a pullback.
And at the other end of the spectrum, we had, for example,
September, October last year, very low. So, this is a notion
of a pendulum swinging back and forth. And, you know, right
now, we're really at the crescendo, a near-term crescendo
of that pendulum. So, we'd not be at all surprised to see
markets pull back a little bit. In fact, we just did sell some
call options on some of our equity positions to bring in
some premium in anticipation of a possible pullback. And this
is just a more broad look at the different markets and
sectors. You know, 100 here is basically two standard
deviations around the 50-day moving average, pretty
stretched. There are some areas like the Dow Jones, you know,
the aggregate bond index that are more than two standard
deviations beyond the upside of their moving average. On the
other hand, you have the dollar, for example, is oversold. We
actually added a very modest bullish dollar position within
the last week. So, there's a lot of things that are forgetting
evaluations for a moment, a lot of things that are bullish on a
short-term basis, but we're getting really, really stretched.
So, we're, you know, being very cautious at this point in time.
But we're still holding plenty of, I think, about 40% or so in
short-term treasuries, still getting 5 plus percent yield.
And we think that's a very appropriate place to be. Let me
make one real important point. You know, if we do get a blow
off of another couple percent here, getting that or not is not
what's going to dictate our client's success over their
lifetimes. We will not lose sight of that real fact. So, you
know, understand that we're looking to add incrementally to
clients forward progress, but the real game here is being
intact and managing very conservatively in light of the
bigger picture because we want this money to be there 30, 40
years for them or as long as they should live.
Great. Yeah. So, even though there may be a few percentage
points still to be got here, it's not worth the risk of
stretching for it when the market's this extended where the
snapback risk is as high as it is right now. All right. And
that's, you know, that's why treasuries right now really are
the prudent investor's best friend, meaning if you get to a
point where you just want to park in safety for a little bit,
you can finally get a good return on it and then a positive
real return on it, which as we've talked about a number of
times, you just haven't been able to get for much of the past
decade plus, right? All right, Mike, coming to you here, feel
free to add on anything that John said as we wrap up here
because we're getting tight on time. If you can just give an
update on two of your, I think, bigger positions there at New
Harbor. One is gold and gold has been, you know, it's been
backing your all-time highs, positively reacting to the
dovish fed news and then anything you want to say about
the long bond, TLT trade, because we get a lot of people
watching that closely, especially as this bond prices,
sorry, bond yields have been coming down and that trade's
beginning to wake back up again. All right, sure, Adam.
Just a further point about the overboughtness or the
over bullishness of the S&P. Let me just move this over here
and here's a daily chart of the S&P. Hope you can see this,
Adam. And, you know, so we had a breakout back here. This is
called a breakaway gap. We became concerned about the
market going on another run once it was challenging this
downtrend. And sure enough, it's moved higher almost in an
uninterrupted fashion. And so, but if you look down here, this
is the RSI, the relative strength index. And, you know, it
doesn't very often get this overbought. It doesn't mean the
market has to immediately turn. In fact, the RSI can stay
overbought for a long, long time. But if you couple that
with the fact that I think it was either yesterday or the
day before we saw record inflows into SPY. SPY is the ETF
that essentially owns the S&P 500. It's the world's largest
ETF. And it saw the largest inflow in a single day the
other day, you know, so much so that they had to create a
record number of shares, new shares to accommodate it. So,
you know, this is, this hasn't been a normal market. This
hasn't even been a normal error that we've been living
through. And so it's quite likely impossible that we do get
a further blow off here. This is the daily chart. You go to
the weekly chart, you'll see that what is this nine weeks
straight up, you know, certainly has been a Santa Claus
rally. And here we are challenging the old all-time
high. It won't be long, I don't think, till we go through
there. So you talked about the opinions that you have on your
program. And most of them are, most of them are relatively
close, or at least they rhyme. I think that Michael Howell was
a little bit different and that he was more bullish for the
intermediate term. But some of your guests say we're going to
spike higher than crash, others say we might go straight down
from here. I know that we've been on the record being
concerned for a long time, even though we think near term,
we're kind of in the camp of a little higher than lower. But
it doesn't really matter that much. Nobody knows the actual
path, to be honest. We certainly don't know. We know how
it's going to end because history tells us so. You know,
evaluations are ridiculously high, you know, up around 40
times margin-adjusted earnings, you know, on a chiller basis.
Stark market cap to GDP is close to 200%. You know, I
mean, any number of, you know, 10 different variables you can
look at are off the charts. And so liquidity may be a tailwind
for a while, but it won't, you know, valuations won't lie
forever. It will matter. We don't know what the catalyst is
going to be. And unless productivity or GDP explodes
upwards to accommodate these valuations, the market's going
to come down. You know, you mentioned Hussman earlier, John
Hussman, his model shows that valuations or normal valuations
would be at around 16 to 1800 on the S&P. So, you know, whether
it dropped from here or dropped from 6,000 or 7,000, it doesn't
much matter. It's still a lot lower than here. Other models
like a GMOs model, Jeremy Grantham's firm show essentially
flat to negative returns over the next seven years. You know,
valuations won't matter. The path is impossible to know. And
here we are, you know, we're up to 30 plus percent equities
hedged. If you include the in the money call option that we
did, we're mid 30s, maybe. So we're doing our best to
participate a little bit. But, you know, we won't go anywhere
near all in at these levels. And we have to constantly be
careful about our reversal. So we're okay with that. That's
the bargain that we that we strike. You know, we know that
we can't participate if the market goes vertical from here.
We're only going to get a piece of it. And that's all right. So,
you know, that's what I wanted to add on the S&P. So let's talk
about two more things. You mentioned gold. And I think you
mentioned bonds too. Yep. So a weekly chart of gold. This is
GLD as a proxy. Essentially, gold is actually I'm going to go
to a month here because a monthly chart better in terms of
understanding it. This giant cup and handle. It's definitely a
stretched out handle. But this is a basically 13, 14 years. And
an inverted head and shoulders. This is the head. There's a
complex shoulder, another shoulder here. And a triple top.
And triple tops don't usually hold. And so gold on the
monthly chart absolutely looks like it wants to break higher.
About a week or so ago, we saw 2,130, I think, in the futures
market. It sharply reversed. We're at around 2,030 on the
spot. We'll move back into the closer chart. So it has been
consolidating for three or four weeks. So frustrating for gold
bulls because it literally looks like it wants to go, but it
hasn't yet. And the same thing with gold stocks and silver
stocks. And silver itself, I'll bring up as well. It looks very
similar. If I went out to a monthly chart of silver, I find
it very interesting that we've got this giant triangle that's
been forming for the last few years. And just a few weeks ago,
it looked like we're finally breaking out. And then we came
back into the triangle. And so here we are again. I'll go back
to the week. You know, we broke out here a couple of weeks ago
and then failure. So we'll see what we need is one big week,
silver to break higher, gold to break higher, and the miners
will absolutely follow. You know, the miners have been
underperforming, but they also are coiling up. The market
hasn't paid that much attention to them. If this happens, and I
believe it will, we're going to see these miners start to move.
So that's gold. Let's take a quick look at long-term bonds,
TLT.
All right, so here's TLT on the weekly chart.
TLT has been absolutely obliterated. Here is the monthly
chart. Lost over 50% of its value, actually fell more than
stocks fell during the housing crisis. And yields went from
basically zero or at least on T-bills and well under 1% on the
10-year. They went to 5% on the 10-year. And this was a bit of a
capitulation move. I believe it was a capitulation, at least a
near-term capitulation. We were getting all kinds of calls and
people were very concerned and we'll admit we were caught a
little bit surprised by how fast this fell. We hedged the best we
could with options and we held onto the position. Now, if we go
to the daily chart, you'll see just how much this has moved. The
10-year went from 5% here to, you know, 3.9 or something here.
I haven't looked at it in the last day or two, but below 4%.
So it's been a straight-up move on the daily chart in this
channel. And we've actually let half the position go back a few
days ago because we had an in-the-money call and we frankly
expect a pullback. We're very bullish on long-term bonds,
long-term. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see TLT go 20%
higher from here at least, 120 to 130 maybe. But I think it's
very likely that yields come back towards 4 or 5 or so. And
that would be maybe TLT 90 to 92. You know, I believe we're
probably going to get a pullback. There's a lot of bulls in
this trade now, and it's been a straight-up move. So we're still
in the position, but half at the moment likely add back if we get
a pullback. And so, you know, certainly would take profits if
you haven't taken any in this space because it's not going to
be -- it's not going to be straight up.
