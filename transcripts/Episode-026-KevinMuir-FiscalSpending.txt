Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. We're all
aware of how the pandemic threw the economy and financial markets into unprecedented disarray.
And for the past two years, investors have eagerly awaited them to return back to a state of normalcy.
But has normal changed versus the pre-COVID days? How much of the old playbook no longer
works well, if at all, in today's world? For answers, we're fortunate to speak today with
market veteran Kevin Muir, founder and editor of The Macro Tourist, the highly acclaimed
newsletter that currently ranks as the number 12th largest financial substack in the world.
Kevin, thanks so much for joining us today. Well, thanks for having me on. It's a real pleasure.
Hey, it is a real pleasure, Kevin. Been a huge fan of your work for many, many years.
It's wonderful to finally meet you in person. Thank you for making the time here in the
holiday season to come on the channel. Lots to talk about with you.
If we can, can we just jump off at the high level question I like to start these discussions with?
What's your current assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
Well, I think you framed it really well, Adam, when you talked about how COVID has changed the
world. And I kind of continually am amazed at how everyone's expecting this cycle to look like all
the other cycles. And I have a buddy, Dario Perkins, from TS Lombard. And he's been saying
them for a while. He says, I don't know why we're expecting this business cycle to look like other
business cycles. Because if you think about it, we sent everybody home, told them that where this
pandemic has hit, everyone go home. Then we mailed everyone checks. Then we went and reopened half
the economy, then the other half. Then we did another inflation stimulus act or inflation
reduction act, but it's in essence an infrastructure bill. This cycle is so much
different than all the previous other cycles. And I think a lot of the playbooks that we used to use
in terms of like yield curve or the soft indicators versus the hard indicators,
all those things kind of need to be rethought. And that's what I think a lot of the investors
are struggling with. And I think that's what we should chat about today.
Okay. Great. I really want to dig into that. We've talked a lot about the unprecedented
deformations that COVID wreaked on the economy and on the markets. So we've talked about that
a lot on this channel. I'd love to get your thoughts, your specific thoughts on that as
we get into this in terms of what specifically has changed that we have to pay the most attention to
and what you think it's likely to bring in the future. I know some of this is a little bit of
a crapshoot because you're in some ways trying to predict what something that's never been in the
state before is going to do. So it's going to keep things interesting. But look, it's been quite a
year in 2023. We went into this year, kind of like you said, everybody kind of looking at old
playbooks saying, "Oh, okay. Well, look, obviously a recession is going to happen early this year."
And 2023 was really the year of the recession that wasn't. And here we are at the end of the year.
And everybody's kind of on the no landing plane at this point in time. Markets are -- I want to
say they're in melt up. If they're not in melt up, they're on their way to melt up status. Nobody
seems real worried at this point about a recession. Powell certainly isn't. He basically just gave
everybody the green light that, "Hey, not saying mission accomplished just yet, but I can see the
light at the end of the tunnel here." So obviously things outperformed everybody's expectations.
Why? What do you think is responsible for this huge surprise to the upside?
Fiscal, fiscal, fiscal. And I think that people have missed this the whole way along.
They've underestimated the power of fiscal. And if we think back to 2008, when we had the great
financial crisis, we tried to fix everything with monetary stimulus. We lowered rates to zero,
and then that didn't work. We did QE. And then when that didn't work, we tried operation twist.
And then we tried operation QE number two and number three. And that was one of the slowest
recoveries on record. Then fast forward to 2020. Well, this time we learn our lesson and we say,
"Well, monetary stimulus doesn't work as well as we think it does. Let's try some fiscal."
And not only did we try fiscal, we did way, way too much. And it's crazy how much we've done.
Especially, I'm a Canadian, but America, when you look at the amount of fiscal as a percentage of
GDP versus the rest of the world, they did way more. You guys did absolutely, I think it's 24%
of GDP in terms of fiscal stimulus. The next closest was 18%. I think we were 16% of GDP.
So, not only did we have the kind of the monetary stimulus that everyone has always been afraid of
and talking about, but we've had this unprecedented shift in terms of the amount of money that the
government has spent and has put into people's pockets. And the one kind of message that I want
to make sure that people leave with today is the fact that we have continually and we still are
underestimating the power of that fiscal. And everyone's saying, "Well, all the money's
been mailed out. All the savings are finished." But there's still a lot of money in terms of the
Inflation Reduction Act, which is basically an infrastructure act that still hasn't been spent.
If you think about the government, if there's one thing we know is that they're slow.
So, when they allocate money to go out and spend to build chip fabs or whatever it is in Texas,
that doesn't get done right away. And when you go look at the state level,
you'll see that that sort of infrastructure spend is just starting to hit now.
And that's why I think that people that have continually believed that this
kind of tightening would stop the economy have been mistaken in that they've kind of continually
underestimated the power of fiscal. Okay. And we've talked about this on this
channel before, where it's funny, I'm going to go through a quick evolution of ways in which I've
talked about this as I've talked to different guests, but I used to position it as the Fed was
putting its foot on the monetary brakes on the economy. And then on the fiscal side, we were
jamming the accelerator and actually had the Fed and the banks that were putting on the brakes and
the fiscal side jamming the accelerator. And it seems to date that the accelerator has been
winning out, right? That's correct, yep.
Yep. And first, let me ask you a question that I've asked a lot of people in the past. I haven't
asked it for a while, so I'm curious to hear your thoughts. If you consider all the excessive
stimulus that we shoved into the system during COVID as the proverbial pig within the Python,
what's your best finger to the wind guess of how much pig is still left in the Python? And maybe
in your answer too, there are still some programs out there that seem like they're even still like
feeding the Python pork chops. He's not on the starvation tie yet. So how much has left to pass
through that? Are we past halfway? Are we on the dregs or is this bigger than folks are expecting?
So I think that you need to think about the stimulus in different ways. And there's no
doubt that the consumer portion of it has almost gone. And so when you see those sorts of analysis,
I think that the Fed, one of the Fed kind of regions had this analysis about when the consumer
savings were going to be depleted and stuff. I believe that the kind of that extra sugar high
that we got by mailing people money and putting it into their checks is almost gone. And all the
forbearance programs and all that stuff. Right. And I think that's, we're almost through that.
And that is what the market has been concerned about when they've been thinking about the
recession that was imminent and was going to come and hit at any point. But at the same time,
as I mentioned, those stimulus programs are the Inflation Reduction Act, which is really
an infrastructure program that's designed to kind of bring manufacturing back to the states.
That's just started. We have barely felt that. And we are going to go and we are going to be
surprised at how many jobs continue to be created. We're going to be surprised
at the amount of capex that is going to occur in the US in strange places that we're not expecting.
And so I would argue that the nature of the stimulus has changed, but it's still got a long
way to go. Okay. So one of the questions that folks have asked around that is, how long can this
fiscal winning out over the monetary efforts? And now it sounds like the monetary efforts might
start easing a bit. So maybe they actually have won the game, won the battle. But basically,
the big question is sort of like, hey, so will this just continue through the election?
Whether it was all to do with rescuing the economy or whether there was some sort of
additional agenda of trying to keep everything goosed through the November 2024 elections,
is your expectation that we're still going to see a rising tide of fiscal spending
through the end of this coming year? Or do you see it maybe ending sooner?
No, 100%. We're going to see continued rise. There's the reason that there's the
kind of time-honored election cycle when it comes to stock markets and economy,
because presidents and parties spend based upon that cycle. And this will be no different. And so
the real question is, is the economy the same as the market? And that might be something that
will be different. Just because the economy is doing better over the next year doesn't
necessarily mean the stock market is going to do better. And I think that too often people
kind of confuse them and think that they're one and the same. Whereas I think that very much,
I'm confident that the economy will continue to do well, but I'm not as sure about the stock market.
Okay. And obviously, I'm going to get to your market outlook in a bit. This topic of fiscal
spending. What you kind of worry about here is like the bear has gotten the taste of meat.
You know, right? Like when he's tasted it, he doesn't want to eat anything else, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Of course, politicians love nothing to do but spend. And honestly, in a pinch and hard times,
consumers want, they're not going to turn away handouts. In fact, they're going to demand them
because they're just trying to put food on the table and you did it before. So the press
has been set, right? So are we in a new era when we're sort of talking about new forms of normal?
Are we in a new era of just kind of ever fiscal spending from here? And what does that look like
in the long run? My mind says that has a bad ending.
I do believe that the world changed and COVID. If we step back and we think about from 1982,
when Volcker beat back inflation with high monetary interest rates, every single recession
that we've experienced, we fixed it by going and lowering interest rates. And if you go look
through the period of all the different interest rates, every single time, we had to lower it to a
new low. And then on the subsequent rise, interest rates didn't get as high before the economy rolled
over. So during that whole period, we were relying solely on private sector credit creation to affect
the business cycle. And eventually what happened was that we stacked so much private sector debt
on it that we hit the great financial crisis. We lowered rates to zero and it didn't work.
So then we tried all these extraordinary measures of monetary stimulus, though still in essence
didn't work. And what happened in 2020 was they said, "Okay, this is no longer working. We have
to think about other ways that you can create money." And so we talked about the fact that
lowering rates encourages banks to lend credit creation, that's private credit creation.
And this time they decided they were going to do government, they were going to spend the money
into existence. And I'll tell you one thing that over the years, I'll tell you a little bit of my
MMT story. At first when I heard MMT, I was like, "That sounds like the stupidest thing I've ever
imagined." I would hear things and I would hear them saying, talking about spending money into
existence and all this stuff. So I went and I actually decided, "Okay, if I'm going to be able
to argue this, I should be able to go and figure out where they're wrong." And if you think about
MMT, not as a prescription in terms of what should be done, but as a description of how the economy
works, they were actually, a lot of their theories are just spot on correct. And what they argued was
that the Federal Reserve, sorry, not the Federal Reserve, the government can spend money into
existence up until the point where real resources are constrained. And then from there on, you get
inflation. And if we think to the problem of the great financial crisis, we had a situation where
private sector was not spending. And what did the government do? Instead of actually stepping in and
spending when there was lack of private demand, they actually did the same thing. They cut back.
And we had a situation where Obama, even though everyone talks about him in the spent through
president, if you look at his discretionary budget, it declined like three out of the four
years after the great financial crisis. So we have a situation where the government previously
did pro-cyclical cuts in spending at a time when they actually, the economy needed the opposite.
Now, the pushback to MMT has always been, "Well, once people start spending and they realize that
they can spend this, they're not going to stop." And that's kind of the argument you're just making.
And I am sympathetic to this. And I've always said that once that like MMT, you can rail about it,
you can spit on the ground every time it's mentioned. But if that's the way the economy
is headed and that's our way our society is headed, why are you sitting there arguing with the market
about it? Like just take advantage of it. Say that this is where we're headed and this is what we're
going to do. So therefore I need to change my portfolio. So I'm a big believer in trade the
market that you have, not the market you want. And so I look at it and I say, "Okay, if you look at
the median voter," and that's something Marco Papic, one of my buddies from Clocktower talks
about all the time. And I think it's a great way of thinking about the political landscape or in
what the person does. If you think about the median voter, the median voter in 2008, when we
had the great financial crisis was all about balancing budgets. They were like, "Okay, we need
to balance the budget. We need to get our spending under control." Think about 2020. Like 2020, it was
like, "No, no, we should spend." And even 2021, 2022, think about the Republicans. They were like,
"Oh, we're going to shut down the economy to balance budgets." And then when it came to it,
they didn't want it. So I completely agree with you that the bear has tasted the taste of meat
and he's not going back to eating blueberries. We're in a new era where we're going to have
continued fiscal spending. And yes, it'll go up and down in waves as we get cyclical moves. We'll
have a recession. And this time, instead of trying to fix it with monetary, we'll also, again, use
fiscal. And instead of arguing about that and deciding which one is better or which one is
proper or which one is moral, just say, "This is the way it's going to be. And I need to adjust my
portfolio." And what that means is that we are going to have a series of inflation, higher sets
of inflation for some time to come. I used to argue that 2% was a ceiling that we would get
in terms of every time we popped up to 2%, it went back down in terms of inflation. I think that 2%
is going to be the floor that we bounce off of. So I could see a situation where for the next decade,
we average 3%, 4% really easily. Okay. I want to get to the Fed in just a second.
Okay. So first off, I'm sure there's already a little bit of a rage fest going on in the comments
of, "Oh my God, this guy's pro MMT." I don't think you are. What I hear you're saying is you
understand a good amount of the logic behind it, but right or wrong, you just think it is going to
be more of the playbook that the central planners play by going forward. And so rather than fight it
and get steamrolled as an individual investor, play the markets that you have ahead of you.
And I'm going to jump to a punchline here that maybe we'll talk a little bit more detail about
in a bit, but I believe that you are a proponent of owning gold. And I believe that's probably
because you expect there to be inflationary repercussions from this new, more MMT driven
playbook. Is that an accurate statement? Yes, over the long run, I believe that is
one reason to own gold. Another reason I think to own gold, which I actually think is even almost
a better argument, is the fact that once Russia went and took over or invaded Ukraine, the world
changed in terms of when the Western and led by America confiscated those FX reserves.
We weaponized the financial system against... That's correct. And if you're sitting there
and just put yourself into China's shoes for a second, you're sitting there with how many
trillion dollars of US reserves. As a percentage of those reserves, you have a tiny, tiny amount
of gold. It's tiny. Yes, they are one of the biggest holders of gold, but as a percentage
of the reserves they have, it's very small. So if they were to just go and get their reserves
up to the same level that a lot of the other countries are at, it would require just gobs
and gobs of buying in gold. And that's what I think we're seeing. And if we look at this past
year, what did we have? We had rising US interest rates. For a long time, the US dollar was rising,
and yet gold hit an all-time high. Yeah, it hung in there.
Sorry to interrupt it, but real interest rates were the highest they'd been in a long time,
which tend to be kryptonite for gold. That's right. And so I've been arguing
for a while now that when you, again, throw away the old playbook, the old playbook about gold
being tied to interest rates or real interest rates and US dollar, it's not as important as
just what the central banks are doing. And the central banks, if I was sitting there and I was
running the People's Bank of China, I would just be buying it every single day. And it would just
be almost imprudent not to be. And so ultimately, I think that you don't even need that kind of
increased inflation for gold still to work. That's just gravy, is what you're saying.
Yeah, I really do. And listen, do I think that when the dollar finally goes down
and the interest rates get lowered and real rates go lower, that that won't help the gold? Of course
it will. That'll be kind of an extra little boost. But that's not the real driving force of this bull
market. The real driving force of this bull market is the Bank of China buying gold because they have
to. OK, so it's much more a geopolitical factor where it's sort of national sovereignty priority.
So when you said China's got a long way to go to catch up to other countries,
are you measuring that as a ratio of gold holdings to US Treasury holdings?
That's correct. I can't remember the numbers off the top of my head, but I think a lot of
like Russia, I believe, was 30 or 40% gold. And there's no way China is going to get to
that level. But there's lots of countries that have 5 to 10% of their reserves in the form of
gold. And if China were to do that, it would suck up every single gold ounce that we mine around.
OK. And that's, I guess, the punch line I was looking for. But guesstimating here,
is it a 10x increase from where they are right now? A 100x increase? What's the size of what
that catch up would need to be? I think they're going to try to buy everything they can without
sending the prices to the moon. I just think they'll just be constantly on the bid. And I
think that's what we've seen. It doesn't matter what the rates are doing. It doesn't matter what
the US dollar is doing. It just keeps driving higher and higher and higher. And that's what
I think it's going to continue to happen. OK. Well, then let's look from here then. So,
we've got gold. I don't know whether you ascribe to this or not, but it's sort of made this like
decade-long cup and handle with the triple top and all that. And if you look at it, I was just
looking at a chart of it this morning, it's like poised right there to break out. And you look at
the landscape that we have right now, which is the Fed basically just told everybody, "Hey,
we're going to start winding this down sooner than later." So, everybody's now thinking pivot
sooner. Everybody's thinking, "Oh, maybe QE again at some point." Hard not to see that. I know you're
saying that's not the primary driving force behind gold right now, but hard not to see that adding
additional wind behind gold sales, breaking it out of that handle. And then maybe there's some
real momentum chasing that goes on from there. What do you think? Oh, I've been saying for a
while that I think we're going to have $1,000 up weak in gold. And I know that sounds ridiculous,
but if you think about it, it's not as crazy as it sounds. It's a small market when you
look at the other big markets out there. And it wouldn't take much. I could see one day we get up,
it's up 300 bucks. Then the next day it's up 200 and then another 400, 200. It really wouldn't
surprise me if all of a sudden out of nowhere, the thing just takes off like that. So, I'm open to
those sorts of moves and I almost expect them eventually before this bull market is over in gold.
All right. And sorry, I didn't mean for us to fall down the gold hole, but this came up at
an opportune time. So, you may not have an answer to this, but I remember hearing stories from guys
like Ron Paul, who during the Volcker era met with Volcker and Volcker would be saying like,
"Right, where's my daily gold report?" And the central bankers were using gold as a mirroring.
They were concerned about its ability to mirror inflation as they were monkeying around with
stuff. And so, they had a vested interest in trying to keep it contained and long-term precious
metals investors. It's hard not to be a long-term investor and get really frustrated by good
conditions where the precious metals don't perform the way that you want them to or they get monkey
hammered at predictable times or whatnot. So, I think there's a general sense, true or not,
is that it's a pretty manipulated asset to begin with. But in this new world order,
do the central planners care as much about keeping gold contained or could they-
No, they don't care. The federal reserve doesn't care what gold does. They care what inflation
does. They care about what bonds do, but they don't care what gold does. Sure, at the margin,
they're going to watch it and stuff, but they're not going to change policy because gold's going up.
They understand that gold is a different sort of asset. And for the reasons that I just mentioned,
it could go up on its own even if inflation is very well behaved and there is proper monetary
policy. We could just have a situation where China wants more. And if that is the case,
then we could have gold going up and doubling over the course of a year. And it doesn't mean
that the Fed is too loose. It could just mean that China wants them.
Okay. Well, at the risk of starting another fight in the comment section,
I don't want to go deep into this, but just since we're on the topic of monetary inflation hedges
per se, I know you're saying that's not the exact main reason to own gold here,
but thoughts on Bitcoin and/or any other cryptocurrency that you think-
I am the worst. Listen, Adam, you don't want to ask me my Bitcoin because I am an idiot.
I literally got told Bitcoin at $5 of this kid beside me, I was trading and he was a computer
guy, he told me Bitcoin at $5. He explained it all to me. I told him that was the stupidest thing I'd
ever heard. Don't mention it again. He then came back to me a month later and said, "You know that
thing you told me is the stupidest thing ever. It's now $50." I was at least smart enough to
realize that if it goes to $50, it could go to $500 or maybe $5,000 I thought on some flukey
chance. So, I actually started way back when Bitcoin was $50 or $100, I started mining it.
I had an interlisted R machine. We did all these sorts of fun things with it. And then it kind of
collapsed and it went quiet and people forget that it went quiet for a few years. And I was always
kind of a skeptic and I thought, "Okay, well, that's it. It's never going to go again." And
I've just completely missed it. So, I am not the right guy to talk to. I am a little bit of a
skeptic. At the end of the day, I think that it's an asset that the government can control and shut
off more easily than people believe. The one thing about gold is if you own gold and you physically
own it in your possession, it is nobody's liability. Now, you might say that about Bitcoin.
You'll be like, "No, it's up there. It's nobody's liability." Well, it's still you have a liability
that the network needs to exist. Just take us for a second and imagine we have a situation where
China invades Taiwan. I don't think this is going to happen. Well, let's just say it happens.
We have a situation where China invades Taiwan and all of a sudden they shut off the internet,
the pipe between the US and China. Now, all of a sudden we have the fork of the Bitcoin
and we have miners in China, miners in the US and they can't go back and forth. I still think that
there's more of a kind of a liability to the network than people think.
More counterparty risk?
Yeah. Well, it's not counterparty risk so much as it's kind of technology risk, but ultimately
at the end of the day, I believe the government controls that technology more than we think.
I think there's what, seven big routers in the whole world that all the internet traffic goes
through. I'm sure the government can do stuff against it. Now, listen, people a lot smarter
than me have come up with lots of reasons why I'm wrong and I have no interest in debating them.
I'm just an old fart that doesn't like it and I'm going to stick with my gold and I have no hair and
what hair I have is gray, so that probably just says it all. Although it didn't stop Mike Novogratz
from doing it, did it? He has no hair just like me and he's a little more progressive than I am.
And it sounds like he's probably sitting on a greater pile of crypto wealth at this point.
That's right.
But the last question on this, which is the geopolitical reasons for central banks,
particularly ones like China, to load up on gold. I don't get the sense that you feel that
that same dynamic is pushing those same players to, for some reason, favor or get into Bitcoin/crypto.
I'd be surprised if the Bank of China was buying crypto. And I could be wrong. Listen,
you know what? I think that people need to remember that one of the things about a trader
is that you need to make sure that you understand that you're going to be wrong all the time.
I saw Anthony Bourdain has a tattoo on his arm that says an ancient group. I am certain of
nothing. I think Anthony Bourdain would have been a great trader and I'm the same way. I am certain
of nothing. So do I believe that Bank of China is going to be buying crypto? No, but anything
can happen and maybe I'll be proven wrong. Okay. Wouldn't shock you, but not part of your
thesis. And that's really all I wanted to clarify. Okay. Well, look, I just mentioned the Fed's recent
move, potentially adding, certainly adding wind sales to the markets, but maybe adding special
wind to the sales of assets like gold. I'm curious, lots of ink being spilled about this
right now. A lot of people calling it the Fed pivot. Obviously the market has taken the football
and just running with it. Do you see it as a pivot? Oh yes, for sure it was a pivot.
Like let's step back and think about September 20th. It wasn't that long ago. At that point,
the Fed was raising 12 and a half bips a meeting, meaning that they were definitely on a schedule
of one hike every second meeting. And if you think about their evolution of tightening,
it started off with, I think the first one was 25, then they did a 50, then they did some 75s,
and then they went down to 50, then they went and did some 25s. And as they got closer and closer
to their target, they reduced the pace of tightening. And I think that Powell talks
about it. He was feeling around trying to figure out the point where they were sufficiently
restrictive. And as they got closer, they slowed down the pace of tightening. So September 20th,
the market was thinking that they had stopped and they came out and they actually very clearly said,
"No, we're still not there. We think we're close, but we're not there." And if you think about back
then, I'm just looking at my notes here, I think September 20th, the US 30 year was 442. Then a
month later was five and a half. The market was caught off guard about how clockish the Fed was
still at that point. So what we did was we had a huge tightening of financial conditions from
September 20th all the way to the end of October. And at that point, the Fed, we hit this level
where we kind of hit the pain point for the Fed. And they came out and they said,
there was in essence, they said, "The tightening of financial conditions has done the work for us.
We don't need to tighten anymore. So we're going to pivot." So that was the first pivot they did.
They said, "Looks like we've hit sufficiently restrictive. And we've hit that because we've
had this tightening of financial conditions." Can I ask a question about that?
Yeah, sure. The answer is you keep going on here. That surprised a lot of people because there's a
lot of financial conditions indexes that have been rising all year. I'm sorry, loosening all year.
Most of them at that point, from that kind of September 20th till October 30th period,
were tightening. Because we had a huge crush in the long end of the bond market. The bond market
just went no bid. And let's think back to that period. Everyone's forgetting about it now, but
there was all sorts of talk about term premium. People that don't really even understood what
the word was were lecturing folks about how the Treasury wasn't going to be able to fund the US
government because the bonds were going to go no bid. The term premium wasn't wide enough and all
this stuff. And Adam, listen, you can go back and look. I've written for Bloomberg for a couple of
years now. And I wrote pieces a couple of years ago about how the bond market was a disaster
waiting to happen. And at that time I got told I didn't understand the bond market. Lots of people
have predicted a bond bear market and lots of people have gotten crushed. And I think back to
the pushback that I got when I was bearish of bonds a couple of years ago. Well, in October,
I got bullish of bonds. I said, "Listen, this thing's gone a long way. We're now at a point
where the term premium is actually positive. We have just sentiment off the charts bearish."
And it was kind of just ironic how when I got a little bit bullish at 5%, I got told that I didn't
understand the problems with the US government. And that we are not like the bonds, we're going
to head to 6%, 7%, 8%. And here we are what the thing's gone from 5% down to four in the space
of a month. And that was largely a function of the Powell pivot. So that was the first pivot.
But what was really interesting was that as financial conditions loosened,
we had a situation where they pivot, all of a sudden financial conditions loosen,
we get to the point where we're actually looser than we were when they first worried about it.
And most people at that point, and me included, expected the Federal Reserve to say, "Hey, wait,
you know what guys? We've eased enough. We're going to be on hold. Everything is fine.
They didn't want to goose it anymore." They would push back on the easing of the financial
conditions is what most people expected a couple of weeks ago. And then-
I would put myself in that camp.
Yeah, I was too. But then very quickly, there was a couple of instances where Powell was given a
chance to push back on that and he didn't take it. And at that point, I was like, "Oh, wow,
look at this. Here it is. They just served him up this softball and he didn't take it." And he did
not push back on the easing of financial conditions. So I would argue that the recent Fed
move when actually at the FOMC meeting shouldn't have been as much a surprise as it was.
But ultimately, too many people fell for this idea that Powell is not going to be the next
Arthur Burns. He's going to be the next Volcker. And I'm going to give you my theory. And here you
go. You were talking about conspiracy theories and stuff like that. I will gladly jump into this
conspiracy theory. And I truly believe that Trump is scaring the establishment. And
that although I don't think it's as overt as Powell saying, "I don't want Trump to get elected,
so therefore I'm going to ease." At the margin, he has changed the equation of the risk-reward
in terms of how will Powell seize the market. So everyone said to me, "But Powell doesn't want
to be the next Arthur Burns." And I said, "No, you're framing it wrong. If you go back and look
over history, for the past hundred years, no president that has had a recession during the
election year has won." I think the last one was Calvin Coolidge in 1924. So when you're thinking
about Powell, he can go and raise rates and push the economy into recession to get inflation down
from 3% down to 2%, like all you guys think he's going to do. That's one option. And the other
option is he says, "You know what? We're pretty close. I don't want to be the one pushing the
economy into the recession. I'm going to ease up." And I truly believe that when he looked at the
kind of risk-reward, he's willing to accept the chance of a little more inflation
for the possibility of maybe averting a recession.
Okay. So averting a recession, I can believe that, but you mentioned Trump earlier,
is his desire to avert the recession and take on a little bit more inflation risk.
To your point, because he wants things to remain rosy enough that the current
administration gets reelected and keeps trying to-
So I don't think it's the current administration. I don't think that he cares if it's Biden or if it
was, let's say, Nikki Haley. And I think that if Nikki Haley was the GOP nominee, then he wouldn't
have been as easy as he currently is. I think that Trump, and listen, I am not making any sort
of political opinion about what should be done. I'm more interested in what will be done. And I'm
just trying to read the tea leaves as I see them. And I do believe that Powell and a lot of the
political establishment don't want Trump to win. They view him as a risk to the government.
And Trump said, "I get reelected. I'm booting Powell from office." So Powell already kind of
knows his job's at risk there. So, and again, yes, folks, this is a completely nonpartisan
conversation we're having here. Just trying to understand the mechanics of what may happen.
So help me understand, how does recession equal Trump versus recession equal Nikki Haley?
Well, Nikki Haley, what I was saying is right now, Trump is the leading contender.
Right. So what I'm saying is you'd have to assume for now that he's going to win the nominee.
So he's going to be the Republican nominee and therefore a recession, as I mentioned,
there hasn't been a president that's presided over a recession and has won since 1924. So we assume
that Trump wins the GOP nominee and then we have a recession. Everyone's like get Biden out of there,
his economy stinks. And all of a sudden Trump's the kind of next president.
Right. So again, and I'm just trying to understand the mechanics that Powell
has to help engineer this. So as long as Trump's the front runner, we go into recession. History
shows that Trump should win, Biden's out. And so I get that. Now, if Trump started losing in the
polls and you had somebody else on the Republican ticket start gaining a comfortable lead on him,
do you think Powell might change? I think at the margin, Powell would change. And I don't
think it's as overt as everyone thinks it is. Like he's sitting around in Machiavelli and thinking it
out. I just think when he's thinking about the risk reward of the different choices, he's like,
oh, geez, you know, like I could go and I could be really tough on the economy right now and I
could push us into a recession to try to get that last hundred basis points out of inflation.
And then I'll be the guy instead of instead of being Arthur Burns,
I'm going to be the guy that handed Trump the victory. Right. And that's how he's thinking
about it. So at the at the margin, he's always kind of trying to weigh pluses and minuses.
And so if you're asking like if Nikki Haley all of a sudden wins, then yes, I think at the margin,
Powell will become, you know, slightly more hawkish. It won't be like all of a sudden,
like we were pricing six and now we're going to do zero because Nikki Haley is there.
It's just at the margin when they're trying to decide the balance of risks that that equation
will change. OK, all right, well, look, there's been a lot of I want to ask your opinion here.
Adam, can I talk before we talk about the Fed? One last thing about I think another part that
people miss is that they don't that too often they're talking about inflation kind of in a
rear view, like looking at it in the rear view. And so they're thinking about right now they're
saying inflation is whatever it was, three and 30 or whatever it is, instead of thinking about what
inflation is going forward. And if you think about John Williams, who's the New York Fed president,
he spoke about this. He said really what you need to be doing is looking when you're setting policy,
you set policy based upon what future inflation is expected to be. So if we look at the one year
inflation swap, meaning the rate that the market thinks the next year, the rate of inflation over
the kind of forward one year, it actually had declined from two sixty five down to two percent.
So when Powell went and in essence in this last meeting and not only did he not push back against
the easing of financial conditions, he seemed to endorse rate cuts in the next year.
What he was in essence doing was looking at what inflation has done and looking at the real rate.
So if you look at the one year kind of treasury rate, you'll see that it's kind of fallen from
five and a half down to four ninety three. So it's declined almost sixty basis points. And so
everyone says, look at look at how much he's eased financial conditions. But in some ways,
in their mind, inflation is that I'm sorry, their policy rate is just as restrictive today as it was
three months ago, because the real rate, meaning the rate above future inflation, is the same.
See what I'm saying that the it's if you're thinking about forward inflation,
if you're setting policy based upon forward inflation, as inflation falls,
as the expectation of inflation falls, you can lower the nominal rate without actually loosening
policy. Right. And that is and that is what they believe, whether whether you believe it or not,
doesn't really matter, because don't forget, it doesn't matter what we think is right.
It matters what we think, understanding what they believe. And so to some extent, they don't view
this last kind of easing and putting those cuts in as as easy as we think it is, as a policy,
as big a policy shift as the markets are taking. OK, that's true. I, Kevin, I mean, we could talk
for five hours on this. This is wonderful. I'm going to I'm going to jettison the question I
was going to ask you on the Fed because we got enough of that out of there. But you're opening
a really other interesting door and we're we're getting a little tight on time. So I want to make
sure we get enough of your market outlook in here. So it sounds like you think that market
participants are their inflation, their future inflation expectations are coming down. Right.
That should be good for bonds. Right. Yes. And, you know, especially if Powell continues
to cut rates and if we ever, ever go back to QE, that should be really good for bonds, too.
So we're at a moment in time where. This year, equities have gone from richly priced to very
richly priced to becoming even more so as you and I speak here, basically, when you look at stocks
relative to bonds, the equity risk premium, it's kind of at one of its worst levels versus bonds
in like decades. Right. Yeah. So are you expecting bonds to do very well next year? And if so.
Well, let's talk about bonds first and then we'll talk about your stocks outlook.
Well, the trouble about the bond market is that it's gone so fast and that when we were talking,
you know, it was it was five percent on the 30 or five and a quarter on the 30 year,
we're now down to four. And it's moving so fast that it's difficult. And that's part of the reason
that stocks have rallied so hard is because the bond market has rallied so hard that they've been
kind of tied at the hip. But if I kind of think about step back and take a bigger picture, look
at things and I think about the NASDAQ 100 and I think about it back in March of 2020, when everyone
was convinced the world was going to end and that the stock market was never going to go up again.
I think that the NASDAQ 100 had an earnings yield of five and a half percent. And meanwhile,
the 30 year was one and a half or one or something like that. So the difference
between locking in your money and giving it to the government versus going out and buying stocks
was huge. Now, fast forward to kind of in October, especially when rates went back up to five percent,
the earnings yield on the NASDAQ I think was four and a half. And so when I think about the kind of
changes that will occur in a lot of financial committees coming the new year, they're going to
start to look at their makeup of their portfolios and say, "Hey, you know what? We're long stocks.
It's been a great run, but relative to bonds, we can now lock in some great levels." And I think
Howard Marks from Oaktree was talking about this, how you go out, you start buying a little bit of
high yield, you can all of a sudden hit your 8% return by buying a fixed income security as
opposed to a stock. Stocks over the long run are expected to perform 8% to 12%, but stocks are
stories and bonds are contracts. And a lot of these bonds now all of a sudden, we have a
situation where you can actually lock in yields and lock in funding. And I think there's going
to be a shift. And I think that that's going to be something that the market misses as well,
is that the big long-term money, I'm talking about like the Calpers and the Yales and all
those kinds of things, they're going to look at this and they're going to rejigger their portfolio
from owning stuff full of equities, and they're going to start at the margin buying bonds.
So I ultimately am not a huge bond fan, but I do think that relative to stocks,
they're attractive. So a couple of questions on this. One is, how material will the capital flows
be out of stocks and the bonds? Enough to actually challenge stock market valuations?
Yes, for sure. I think at the margin, we're going to start to see more selling in stocks,
and we're going to see more buying in bonds. And I think we're going to be surprised at the
performance between those two changes. The equity risk premium, as you mentioned, is at levels that
dictate that that's the smart, prudent thing to do. Right now, stocks are running and everyone's
all excited about it, but the kind of the longer term, more patient money that thinks about things
in the bigger picture will be doing this trade, selling the stocks when they're expensive.
Okay. So I had a bond analyst, Alf Pecatiello on the program not that long ago. He also runs
a pretty successful substack, but Alf makes a very similar predictions that the bond whales who have
been on a relative basis buying a lot less in recent years are now going to move in for a lot
of the reasons that you just talked about. One additional reason he mentioned, and I just found
this chart here I want to pull up, I just want to get your thoughts on it, was the correlation
that stocks and bonds have. His analysis shows that at a high enough level of inflation,
bonds and stocks no longer become inversely correlated. So we've been in this high inflation
period where bonds weren't giving you the counterbalance that you wanted them.
And now that inflation is coming down and expected to come down further in the future,
these guys are saying, "Hey, I can lock in those tasty returns, but I can also now finally get that
negative correlation to diversify the way that I want to." So it's another reason for these whales
to be buying into this market. Do you agree with that? Well, no. So I'm in a slightly different
camp. And part of the reason that I'm hesitant to get too bullish on bonds is that ultimately,
I am a believer that we are going to have more inflation. And I am a believer that this economy
will likely be run hotter. And everyone's all excited about the fact that Federal Reserve
has just pivoted dovishly. But if you think about it as a long-term bond investor, it's actually the
worst thing that could happen to you. Everyone thinks that they want the Fed to loosen rates to
be bond positive. Yes, you want that over the short run. Over the long run, the Fed has just
told you that they're willing to accept more inflation. They're willing to risk more inflation.
And as a long bond investor, assuming no default, that is actually what is your ultimate enemy.
And so, you know, over the long, long run, I believe that we're going to get more inflation
and therefore bonds are not a great investment. So when I'm talking about the shift, I'm expecting
more of a change, a shift kind of into corporate bonds, more things of that nature. And I suspect
the government bonds, especially the long end, will be surprisingly weak going forward. And I
think that they're not the greatest investment. But I do find it interesting that you're bringing
up the stock bond correlation, because when I think about the biggest challenges facing investors
kind of going forward, I think that that flipping of the stock bond correlation is the number one
most kind of difficult thing for them to deal with. And so what do I mean by that?
So if you think about most... Sorry, them being the Fed, them being who?
No, investors. That is the most difficult thing for, you know, like we can talk about the Fed.
The Fed doesn't really control the long end. They control the short end. But if we think about
investors and kind of what the last 40 years, we've had just this great environment where
bonds have been negatively correlated to stocks. Okay. And they've also been in a huge secular
bull market up until 2020. It was just the greatest of all worlds because rates went from
18% in 1982 down to zero, basically. 40-year uninterrupted tailwind.
Yeah. And not only that, the fact that the bonds and stocks were negatively correlated was so
important because in essence, that meant that you could lever up your portfolio because at a time
when your stocks, your volatile asset was doing badly, you could count on your non-volatile asset,
the bonds, to perform better. So, you know, Ray Dalio became the richest hedge fund manager of
all time by taking advantage of that and instituting risk parity. So, when we have
this situation where in the last couple of years that that kind of correlation has broke down and
not only has it broke down, it's actually flipped. That was why we had a situation where the 60/40
had two of the worst years that they've ever had because the bonds and the stocks were going down
at the same time. And one of my lines that I've always used Adam, as I've always said,
"Be careful about bonds. Everyone expects them to be a ballast in your portfolio.
I think they're going to turn into the anchor." And ultimately, I do believe that that is still
going to continue. And so, especially the long end. So, when I say bonds, like back to the equity
risk premium, I'm thinking more you replace it with like five-year corporate bonds and things
of that nature, as opposed to going out and buying long dated bonds. Because ultimately, I think this
move is most likely done on the long end, although I could see a situation where the Fed lowers rates,
but I could see the Fed lowering rates, yet the long bond actually rising in yield as investors
become increasingly uncertain that the Fed is committed to their 2% target as much as-
Their inflation target. Okay. So, just to be fair to Alf, his outlook is tailwind for bonds for 2024,
but then he expects there to be secularly higher inflation going forward. So, it's sort of a
shorter term outlook and then you want to get out of it. I'm curious where you're saying is,
do you even expect much more of a continued downtrend here or do you think people are going
to start worrying about inflation sooner than most people? Oh, I think we're almost at the end
of the bond bull market that we've experienced in terms of this correction. We were in a bond
bear market and we've had this correction at the Fed pivot and especially at the long end,
I think the long end is going to struggle from here. Let's just stop and think about what happens
when the Fed goes and actually eases. Usually the Fed eases and what happens is the bond market
steepens, the yield curve steepens, meaning that the long end and the short end, the difference
between the two rises. And usually the short end goes down, but- Yeah. So, if we get a situation
where the Fed, you have to ask yourself, what do you think is going to be the new lower limit of
the Federal Reserve rate? Where is the Fed going to stop? And if you believe that we are back into
the environment of the post GFC, pre-COVID era, where interest rates are going to zero at the front
end and we're going to be stuck with very little growth, then for sure you should go out and buy
bonds. But if you believe like I do that the fiscal stimulus will continue and that even
when we get a situation where all of a sudden the economy does bad, we will see more spending
and I think we'll see increased inflation going forward. I could see a situation where the Fed
really, the new kind of lower level is 2%. So, if you go to 2% and you think about the fact that in
a normal yield curve at that point when they're the kind of the most easing, you get 250 basis
points between twos and tens, that means tens should be 4.5%. And so, I suspect that from here
you're going to be kind of the long end will be a wash. You'll be hard pressed to kind of do more
than earn your coupon I think from here. Okay. Let me just bring up this one chart for a second
just to get your reaction to it. This is the chart that shows the federal funds rate prior to each
recession that we've had over the past 30 plus years. The recession has been preceded by a pretty
aggressive run-up in rates. Then we plateau for a little bit and then rates plummet as the Fed
basically is chasing the economy down saying, "Oh gosh, I over tightened. I got a stimulant here."
What I hear you sort of saying is this time might be different because of this new normal we're in.
Is that true? Well, but you're talking about this new normal. I wouldn't say it's a new normal. I
would say it's the shift from monetary, Lynn Alden came up with this, the shift from monetary
dominance to fiscal dominance. I believe that that's what you're going to experience is that
it's changed the playbook. Remember when I mentioned how the peaks were always lower?
Can you put the chart up again? Oh yeah, absolutely. Sorry about that.
Sorry. I didn't mean that. I want to show something here because I think
it illustrates what I say. If you look in 1987, that peak was 12 and then we lowered rates to three.
And then on a subsequent rise up, we went to six and a half, seven and then we lowered rates to one.
Then we went up and we went to five, blah, blah, blah. And so each time now, think back, we forget
now, but there was lots of people saying when we would hit 2%, they were saying the economy was
going to roll over. Yeah. I interviewed a lot of them.
Oh yeah. There was tons like Goldman Sachs, a lot of people. And the thing that going back,
what did they miss? They missed the fact that there's fiscal. So if you could tell me that
tomorrow we're going to get a government that is going to try to balance the budget,
it's going to stop spending and it's going to reign in everything, then I would tell you,
I would completely change all my outlooks. I would say, in that environment, we're going to
see a situation where we very well could go back to the lows and we go back to 0% and we have a
return to that old thing. But I don't believe that's going to happen. As your great analogy
about the bear tasting meat, I think that we're going to be surprised at how much politicians
find excuses to go and to keep spending. And ultimately, I think it was Bill Fleckenstein
that came up with this. He says the governments are going to keep spending until the bond market
takes away the keys. Right. Yeah. That's a great line. And I think that he's probably on something.
I'm just hesitant to go and get too bullish on bonds or to get too bearish on the economy,
because ultimately the government steps in and spends. The one lesson we should be taking from
the COVID example is the fact is that the government can go and can fill an economic
hole way better than anyone imagined. And that's kind of the real lesson. Right. If the government
spends, they can affect the economy. Now we can argue about whether over the long run that's
going to cause pain or whether that's going to cause the economy to be as efficient as it should
be. And I have no desire to debate that because I don't know, but I don't even think it matters
because the reality is that we're not trading over the low. We're not putting on our portfolios
for the next 30 years and forgetting about them. We're putting it on for the next three, five years.
And over that period, I contend that I think that the government will continue to spend.
Okay. Well, so in wrapping this up here, I want to get to your kind of market outlook and you can
put whatever term you want on the next three years, the next 12 months, whatever you feel
comfortable with next three months. But what do you think is more likely to happen? This is not
a guarantee. This is just your best assessment. And what assets are you looking at right now as
good ones to consider for that type of environment?
So we haven't talked a lot about the Mag-7, but the reality is that everyone's expected a
recession. And just to go show you how difficult this game is that we all play is that if you go
back to the beginning of 2023 and everyone was expecting higher rates and the overwhelming
consensus was that that was going to hurt long duration assets like tech stocks. And I was the
first one to agree with that. And I thought that that was the case as well. And what's happened is
the Mag-7 is just taken off. And for a variety of reasons, they borrowed long, they have all
sorts of cash at the short end. We had an AI kind of alpha extra, an extra alpha boost from the AI
kind of bull market. But increasingly we have a situation where those seven stocks have dominated
like the zeitgeist and everyone's bought them so hard that a lot of the other stuff is cheap.
It is really cheap. You go look at small caps, small caps versus large cap are one of the
cheapest forward PE kind of differences that we've seen in years. You go look at foreign assets like
other countries. Now, a lot of this has changed ever since the Powell pivot because a lot of
these things have just run up. And the reason they've run up so hard is because there was so
much crowding in those names, meaning that everyone was long the Mag-7 and they were
underweight/short everything else. And when I look at the kind of investing horizon and think about
it, I really think there's continuing to be opportunities in those other names and those
other kind of asset classes, like whether it be value, whether it be small cap, whether it be
foreign stocks. I think that a lot of those things were held back by Powell keeping his foot on the
throat of the economy. And at the very least, even if he didn't do it, there was always worry
that he would. And I suspect as that changes, the nature of what works within the market will vary
tremendously. And I just want to leave you with something here in terms of the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq
was up 55%, the S&P this year, the S&P is up 26%, but the S&P equal weight up 13.5%. It's not that
good. It really isn't. The Mag-7. The Mag-7 is up 110. And one of the things that everyone always
talks about, I find retail investors always think that institutional investors are so much smarter
and they have so many more options and they're at such an advantage. And I always tell them,
no, in essence, you guys are the ones at the advantage. First of all, you can get in and out
really quickly. You don't move markets like a big institutional investor takes days, weeks,
sometimes months to buy and sell stock. But most importantly, they don't have the ability to sit
through career risk underperformance. So, an institutional investor can't have the Mag-7 going
up 108% and not participate. And a retail investor can just say, "Hey, wait, these are good stocks,
but at this point, that makes no sense to chase those." I don't have to do it. And so I really
think that retail investors should think long and hard about taking advantage of the kind of
career risk chasing that institutional investors must do. One of the perfect examples of this,
Adam, is that over the long run, there's been all sorts of studies about how equal weight
outperforms market cap weight over time. You can go look at it. I think AQR has written about it.
The other research shop has written about it. There's tons of studies out there that over time,
equal weight wins over market cap weight. And the reason that not everyone invests in it,
first of all, if your Calpers are one of those big guys, you can't invest in it because the liquidity
of you trying to buy an equal amount of Apple and an equal amount of the 500 stock makes it
so it just doesn't work. But even more important than that is you can't take the one, two, three,
five years of underperformance that we're experiencing.
But you also, I think, get the punishment or reversion of the mean, where you have to chase
into it because it was up 100% this year. You have to own it. Given the fact that it had an outlying
year, the odds of it having an underperforming year are not bad given reversion of the mean.
Right. Because if you think about the equal weight right now, what is the equal weight going to do?
They're going to be selling at the end of the year or whenever rebalances, they're going to be
selling their mag seven. Right. Because they owned it at equal weight. It was all equal weight and
they've all doubled. Now they got to put everything else equal weight. So they're going to be selling
their mag seven and they're going to be buying the stocks that underperformed and were actually down.
And so long and short of it is that as a retail investor, you should really go look at taking
advantage of kind of those constraints that professional investors are under.
And so when I'm thinking about it, we have a situation where this is extreme,
meaning that those seven stocks have been done so well versus the rest of the market.
And one of the problems I have whenever someone asks me about the market, I'm like,
well, I'm pretty bearish those seven stocks. I don't see how they're going to have difficulty
growing into that. You just have to go back and look at the nifty 50 in the 1970s. A lot of those
companies ended up being absolutely terrific companies that did everything from a fundamental
perspective that the bulls thought they would do. But in terms of investments, they were terrible
investments. They went nowhere and they just kind of dripped for the next decade. And I kind of
expect that's what's going to happen with these nifty 50s. And so when I'm thinking about what I'm
looking at kind of going forward, never before have I felt so strongly that you should look at
not being in the market cap, big name stocks. And you should really think about when you're
kind of benchmarked to the S&P 500, you should be really aware of what you own and how much risk
you're taking in those seven names. Wow. Okay. That's a bold statement,
declarative statement. Never before. Never before. What do you mean?
I thought you said never before. Have you been sort of this concerned about the differential
between the market? So I'll tell you the only time I've ever been this worried about it was
I'm a Canadian and we had a situation in Canada where Bell Nortel was our biggest stock and Bell
owned a big chunk of Nortel and our index actually became 45% of the TSC 300. And it was terrible for
active managers because think about it from a fiduciary point of view, they actually couldn't
own 45%. Like it made absolutely no sense. So as this stock was rallying so hard, everyone
was underperforming. And it just, these things, I would be shocked if we have a situation where
the mag seven is able to continue this level of outperformance. And I really suspect that as we
kind of go through year end and a lot of these finance committees meet and think about their
portfolio and they look at it, they're going to be trimming this thing. And so I suspect that it'll
be for sale for a long time. And not only that, Adam, one of the things is they've actually no
longer are the leaders. Think about this rally of the last little while. What did you want to own?
Like the mag seven, sure they're up, but they're not up as much as the rest of it.
And so you buy the stuff that's the new leader. And I just,
I don't think the mag seven is going to be the leader like it was last year.
All right. Well, you're in good company too. A few weeks back, I interviewed Fred Hickey
of the high tech strategy. He says he's about as bearish on the mag seven as he's been in over much
of his career. So it's good company to be in. Well, look, this has been fantastic. And I love
this point about that. The advantage of the equal weight index is being an advantage for the small
guy. The whole mission of this channel, Kevin, is to help the small guy gain whatever rights they
can against the power brokers who have had a lot of the advantage on wall street and have slanted
the playing field to their advantage. So whenever we can find an opportunity here, it's awesome to
be able to highlight that for folks. So thank you for doing that. Just from my notes, I heard,
Hey, look at small caps, look at emerging markets, look at corporate bonds, at least for the short
term, looking at five year duration issue. So you like gold, you encourage people to look at equal
weight indices, and you're cautious about the mag seven. Two last questions for you. First one,
very important for folks that have really enjoyed this conversation, Kevin, maybe this is the first
time they've gotten exposure to your work or seen you live. Where can they go to follow you
in your work? They go to the macrotourist.com. And if you want to see some of the old pieces,
just send me an email, kevin@themacrotourist.com, and I'm happy to send you off some of the recent
pieces. All right. That's very kind of you and very courageous of you to share your email address
there. And when I edit this, Kevin, I will put those up on the screen so folks know exactly where
to go. Folks, I'll have links in the description too. So you can just have one click access if you
want to. All right. The second question I'm going to ask you right after I do just a little bit of
housekeeping, so you can think about it, Kevin, is we've just spent the past hour plus talking
all about ways in which we hopefully can improve our financial wealth prospects from here.
What's an investment that you would encourage somebody to consider adopting in their life
that's not financially related? I've been asking this question of late and getting some really
interesting answers. Would love to hear your thoughts. As you think about that, two things.
Folks, if you've really enjoyed having Kevin come on the program half as much as I have,
this has been a joy for me and would like to encourage him to come back on again hopefully
at some point early in 2024 to kind of give us an audible call on how he sees things. Let us know
by hitting the like button and clicking on the red subscribe button below as well as that little bell
icon right next to it. And just a reminder, just as Kevin has his sub stack, which you should totally
go out and check. And I think if they go to macro tourist.com Kevin, they can find their way to your
sub stack from there. That's correct. Yep. Okay, great. I have my new sub stack that's out there.
It's adamtagert.substack.com. I provide a lot of free information on everything that's going on
in this new thoughtful money movement. But I have also resumed my Adam's notes, which are my cliff
notes for my key takeaways from these interviews, including this one with Kevin. And so if you want
to get those Adam's notes, go to the sub stack, subscribe for the premium service. You'll get it
as part of the premium benefits. And just a quick reminder, it's very inexpensive right now. It's
like eight bucks a month. That price is going up at the end of the month. And so if you're thinking
about becoming premium, do so quickly because you can get grandfathered in at that low price. And as
long as you remain subscribed going forward, you will keep that low price. So anyways,
one of the folks know about that. Kevin, we're here at the end with this final question here.
What's a non-financial, non-money related investment you think folks would be wise to
consider? Yeah, I got two answers. I'm going to go with the cheesy one first.
Life is short. Make sure you spend time with the family. Make sure you spend time with the kids.
Kind of make sure you're not spending too much time staring at the screens and you're giving
people your attention. You'll turn around. Next thing you'll know, I'm 53 years old. My kids are
moving out of the house and I'm happy for all the time I got to spend with them. But there's lots of
there's lots of times that I wish I had kind of been more aware, more present, spending time not
worrying about what the next tick in the S&P was going to be and spending time like learning and
listening to them. That's the cheesy answer. The other one is that we all know we have to keep
learning. One of the things that I think that as traders/investors is you need to keep expanding
your tools. I think that especially the young people that are coming up and trying to figure
out how they get into this industry, work on your programming, work on your Python, work on your R,
work on learning a computer language. You don't need to be the next Bill Gates or whoever that's
programming really fancy stuff. But these increasingly are becoming the tools upon which
we all use and that's going to really differentiate your ability to understand and find kind of
anomalies, find and understand the markets better. So anyways, work on your programming, R and Python.
Wow, those are both great. So for the second one, really kind of learn the fundamental language that
the future of business and the skills required to succeed, learn what that fundamental language is.
I got to say on the other one about spending time, life is short. You're putting a dagger in my heart
for two reasons. One, my youngest is a senior in high school this year. So we're staring at the
empty nest coming up. So I lament that fear of yours all the time. It's been a really busy year
for me. I've been running in startup mode forever, but recently just started helpful money even more.
So I'm even more like heads down what I'm doing. And it just kills me when end of the day, I stand
up and I finally done the last email or whatever, and then she's already off to bed or whatever. And
I feel like one more day. And tied to that, as you and I were talking before we put the camera on,
as folks know, I think most folks know my father passed away this past weekend. And yes, it's a
reminder that life is short and we always never get as much time as we want. And I will say,
I'll probably have already talked about this in the weekly market recap with Lance, but
my dad was, he was an older guy, he's 89. He was a man of few words and there was a lot left unsaid.
And I always thought that he could see the end of his life coming. I thought that maybe he'll be in
a place where we can have some of those conversations, but this all just happened so
quickly that he was fine one week and then he was gone the next. So just never happened. And so just
don't assume you're going to get that chance, make the time now as you're saying. Well, Adam,
and I'll just say this, I'm sure everyone's listening and will share my sentiments when
I say we're sorry for your loss. You're super kind. Thank you, Kevin. Anyways,
just makes me like even more after this wonderful hour that we've spent together.
Thanks so much, Kevin. Like I said, I really hope to be able to get you back on this program.
Whenever you want to come back, this platform's here for you. Everybody else, if you are still
hungry for additional content after watching this one, I just finished. Kevin mentioned that he has
written in the past for Bloomberg. I just recorded an interview with Simon White from Bloomberg.
A great analyst like Kevin had never met him before. Really enjoyed that conversation.
I'll put up a link to that right here if you're hungry for more. But other than that, Kevin,
it's been a pleasure. Everybody else, thanks so much for watching. Thanks, everyone.
