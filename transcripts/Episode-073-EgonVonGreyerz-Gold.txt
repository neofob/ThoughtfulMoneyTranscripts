you look at stocks against gold now I
see I'm still on vacation folks but I
recorded a few months back that hasn't
with Egon von Greer's one of the greats
This video hasn't appeared until now
was filmed under. I had just come back from the death of my father and on that flight back I caught
Covid and so I was interviewing Egon here while I was in the throes of Covid and
sort of as a result of that and a result of me having to then as soon as I got over Covid having
to focus on passing a securities exam, this video just never got the proper editing it deserved.
I've now had time to do that and so I'm making that available to you here. The content of the
video is actually even more relevant today versus when it was recorded because of the historic
price that gold has now risen to in the ensuing couple of months. So without further ado, please
enjoy this interview with the great Egon von Greer's. Egon, thank you so much for joining us today
all the way from Switzerland. All the way from Switzerland. Great to be on your show. Thank you
very much and I have to give credit to you. You've done extremely well and I wish you all
the best on your new channel also. I know you're doing well already so
very well. I appreciate that very much and one sign that we're doing well at this early
stage is that we've landed Egon von Greer's on the channel. I can't wait to watch the interview
with him. It's apparently going to be a great one. So well kicking things off here, look I've
had your colleague there, Matthew Piepenburg on the channel. I've actually interviewed him
several times this year. They've been several of I think the most popular interviews we've had
because Matt's such a well-spoken guy but also in part two to the work that you two do there at
gold Switzerland. So as I mentioned in the intro here, I would like to delve into your area of
expertise which is gold. Like I said, it's had a really actually impressive run over the past two
years. It looks like it may have a continued run going forward from here. Before we get into the
specifics of that though, I'd like to talk a bit about your macro outlook, how you see the world,
and if we can start with the general question I'd like to ask all my guests at the very beginning,
what's your current assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
Well Adam, that's a very good question for me because my whole life has consisted of
trying to understand risk and protect against risk. Whether that's been in banking where I
started or corporate life where I was the vice chairman of a major retail company and the biggest
consumer electronics retailer in the UK. And then of course in my own investment activities,
I always focused on the risk and on the downside because if you understand the downside risk,
we all know that the upside takes care of itself. And already at the end of the 90s I decided that
this is not going to end well and I saw debt building up, I saw obviously derivatives
building up also at levels already then which I thought were unsustainable and then of course we
had the tech stock run also which actually I was very concerned about also and I was involved with
the tech company and told my partner we should sell. We did sell at the beginning of 2000 and
that the people who bought it went bust like everybody else. Companies were going at 10-time
sales with no profits. So those kind of risks I always understood and focused on and of course
then we had the 2006-09 problem also in the world and all that has happened since then is just
unlimited credit creation and that's what kept the world going and GDP increasing. Real GDP hasn't
increased for years and the financial system now is a massive bubble, stock markets are in a bubble,
the economy is only being kept up by excessive credit which is of course fake money and I think
that forecasting is a mug's game and to be forecast at a specific time or date
serves no purpose. So instead we look at risk and to me the risk is now excessive, has been for a
while, you never know when things are going to happen and you know our whole really strategy or
vision has been to protect against this risk. It probably has to do with my age also when you're
young, you trade, you invest and you're active. At this point I think and especially now at this
why the world is now I think wealth preservation is becoming absolutely essential because I think
the world economy markets and asset prices are going to collapse. As simple as that whether that
happens in 2024, I don't know and I don't care but the risk is that it will do and I think there's
a high chance but it doesn't matter. I think the most important thing is to protect against that
risk and not worry about the day it happens. We know one thing for certain that you can't buy your
fire insurance when the fire has started so you're going to protect now and I think people who are
going to stay in these bubble markets are going to have a shock. Whether that happens in 24 as I said
we will know afterwards but I think the risk is high and therefore I think now is the time to
protect your assets rather than to try to make money. As Richard Russell said that the people
who in the market we're going to see in the next few years, people who lose the least are the
winners because there are not going to be many people who make a lot of money. That's absolutely
certain in my view. So that's my view looking from above. You could say a bit pessimistic but I'm not
a pessimist at all. I love life. I love being active in business. I love people but I don't
think that the euphoric era we've had now for at least 20 years or you can say 50 years since 1971
that is over and we're seeing the very final stages of that in markets also in my view.
So I think we better be careful and then we haven't even touched upon the geopolitical side.
To me, that is looking extremely dangerous now also and that includes not just the various
wars we have but also the migration and therefore internal problems in many countries
and possibly major conflicts between I won't say the East and the West but Arab and Muslim
countries and the West because what's starting in the Middle East now in Israel is very very
dangerous because that could easily spread to something much much bigger. So those are the some
of the risks and they're big enough. I think that risk is now bigger than ever in history because
this is global. The economic risk is global in virtually every major economy and the geopolitical
risk is also now major. So that's my outlook and not very happy but we have to deal with
the situation as it is not as we hope it to be. Okay well you started right in the thick of where
I wanted to bring things so why don't we just really delve into this and then we'll get into
sort of the potential solution side or actions to take side in a bit. You had made a recent quote
that I was going to read but you pretty much just walked through your main points from it.
I just want to note that you said this is one of the most precarious times in history
from the quote I'm pulling from. You said financially, socially, politically and
geopolitically and you mentioned several of those risks right there. One risk you didn't mention yet
I'm just curious to get your thoughts on is the social side of things. So I get that you feel
financially we kind of have a terminal patient on the table that is being kept alive by the
successive credit creation right now. Geopolitically you talked about the fracturing risks that we've
all seen over the past couple years becoming more alarming. Socially I'm curious to hear sort of
where you see the biggest fault lines but what I'll just highlight for you to react to is it
seems that we have an increasing acceleration at least in most of the western economies where more
and more of the prosperity is being concentrated in a smaller and smaller group sort of an elite
class and the average person is getting more and more squeezed and seeing their prospects diminish
which doesn't seem like a good recipe for anything other than at some point
real civil strife. So anyways I'm curious when you talked about socially here what are some of
the factors that have your attention and concerns the most? Oh no you're absolutely right. The social
side is extremely dangerous what we're looking at now. The gap between the rich and the poor
hasn't been as great as this for decades if not more than maybe well I won't say a century but
because but it's been a very long time that we since we have saw this kind of gap and that
never ends well that always ends in some kind of revolution either that doesn't mean revolution
other people will take to arms but I you know if you take the social unrest due to poverty
which will happen and then add to that the fact that in virtually every country in Europe and in
in North America we now have a major immigration problem and you know that's not the immigrants
force. If you take Germany or Sweden or UK I mean a lot of these countries have just opened
their arms to more people than they can take care of and therefore if you open your borders
like Germany has Sweden has etc for people and you don't have schools you don't have a training
program for them you don't can't even teach them the language you don't have jobs for them then
you know what can they do well all a percentage always then obviously finds that prime is a very
very very useful way of actually making a living now that's a minority but that minority is making
a major impression on the whole country you take Sweden for example now which was the most peaceful
country in the world I grew up I was born there I'm Swiss and Swedish but I was born in Sweden
it must was the most peaceful country ever and now sadly the immigration situations created
drag gangs that are shooting people on a daily basis it is one of the worst countries in Europe
now so you know that's and then in America we're going to see the same thing you know you just see
what's happening at the Mexican border there you know and they're just the masses that are coming
in from all over the world and and that will create unrest also and of course when you have
this then disparity between the rich and the poor you will you will bail you will people will blame
the poor uh or blame the immigrants um and you know it's not by accident that you have parties
like in in Holland now the builders who was anti-immigration anti uh you know
anti-everything that's happening society today and he's uh you know he was now the majority
won the majority of the Dutch uh not not absolute the majority he was the biggest party in Holland
uh and so and we are going to see that more and more right-wing parties you know you take
Manila in in Argentina that's the same thing uh we're going to see more of that and that in itself
will create you know sadly you know more or not Nazi uh parties will grow and they will be also
obviously anti-immigration um and that will create social unrest in itself uh between the
the various sections of society plus as I said and as you started with the difference between
the rich and the poor also so the social unrest will be at so many different levels
so that is a real concern and I think that will obviously take years to develop because it's not
going to happen overnight but at the same time we know that if riots start when they can they
go not just throughout the whole country as a wildfire but they also go across borders also
and there's a risk of that in the next few years so so you're right we have the combination of
all the geopolitical and the financial problems and then we have also the social world yes we
could I don't want to be a pessimist I really I as I said I want to see uh look at life in
in the pot from a positive aspect if you look at the risks there are as we started earlier
they are bigger than ever in history as far as I know on a global basis okay and I think um you
know there's there's being pessimistic there's being overly optimistic and then I think there's
being realistic I I get the sense Egon that you were trying to be a realist through all this um
one quick aside I just want to take for one second here for for my audience Egon is um I uh
I do actually want to talk more about the the topic of immigration in 2024 for a lot of the
reasons that you mentioned it's an emotionally charged topic it's one that that at least in the
states we have a hard time having a dialogue around because uh issues of of class and race
get get thrown into it really quickly um but it is a very real issue and it's one that that
here in the states and I sense also in a lot of other especially western countries there doesn't
seem to be much of a coordinated strategy around um I would say probably the biggest part of our
our border strategy the biggest issue with our border strategy is we just don't seem to have one
right now um and we yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of issues wrapped up in it um you know what
sort of social services can we offer our citizens um how do we offer that if if our citizenry is
increasing at a faster rate than we're planning for um we actually have a pretty big underemployment
problem in the U.S. where we have over a hundred thousand working hundred million working age
adults who are classified as not in the labor force uh so we should be probably figuring out
how to activate that labor force before we bring in too many more other people that we don't
necessarily yet have a plan for how to employ um so it's it's it it is a very thorny issue
uh emotionally and otherwise but I think to not talk about it uh is to you know the the way to
plan to fail is to fail to plan right if we just ignore the problem it's only going to get worse
so my ask here of of our viewers right now is if you are interested in having more discussions on
this topic here on this channel uh let me know in the comments section below but my ask of you of
the viewers is if we do indeed proceed with that uh that the agreement between all of us here is
that we're going to have a very uh intellectual and hopefully uh emotionally impartial discussion
around it uh and try to do it in the adult-sized way where this can be one of those channels where
we can actually address this topic without you know spiraling out of control on a lot of the
the the charged emotion that so often comes along with it um all right so egon um so I want to get
through this topic to the optimistic part of the story but to get there we have to get into you
know really what you sort of expect could be coming um and so uh I know you say timing it is
a mug's game and I agree with that um sort of like it's like watching um you know the the old
experiments where you pile sand up right is is the higher the pile gets you can't predict when
it's going to collapse but you can predict the probability of collapse gets higher the higher
the sand pile gets right um so from a financial standpoint we have talked a lot again with your
colleague Matthew Piepenburg we've talked about the the debt issue that you've raised and I think
one of the things that that I clearly get from Matt is that you know history is pretty clear on
what happens when countries over issue debt and uh and then the economy begins to live in service
of that debt and essentially what happens is is um it begins to become a bit of a vicious cycle but
at the end of it the currency is always sacrificed in service of the debt and I presume that's one
reason why you're so um involved in gold is that for you is a protection against that right so one
of the things I think you see financially is a if not a destruction of the fiat currencies at least
a dramatic uh weakening of them in terms of purchasing power so that's one of the things
you see coming I believe correct me if that's wrong um what else do you see coming as a as a
mix of this risk soup that we've been discussing here well you know if we step back a bit and look
at the eras that that we go through in history and you know whether we call it the fourth turning
which is a popular term or whether we call it just a coming depression the the that those are
inevitable these cycles they are exacerbated by the ineptitude of governments in dealing with them
and the problem is that at the end of these eras you get the worst kind of governments over
leaders are instruments of their time and now we are in a time where we have
decadence where we're living on debt where you know the the the kernel of society the families
you know most western countries breaking up you know there's so many one-parent families or
children who maybe have no no parents looking after them so we are now in an era which as I said
sadly this is not the time for strong leaders to come in my view is that we now need to see
a proper forest fire the the debt situation that we have can never be repaired ever there is no
chance that you know the the the u.s federal debt the private debt the hundred hundred trillion total
debt in the u.s as an example or the 330 trillion global debt plus derivatives which is a quasi debt
and nobody knows how big they are because you have the shadow banking system but they could easily be
a couple of quadrillion in my expectation and that couple of quadrillion could easily become real
debt one day when when central banks have to try to save the banking system by giving the bank
support for these enormous derivative portfolios that they're carrying so therefore you know it's
hard to be optimistic about this era i think we have to go through this now and we have to go
through this in a way that we need that forest fire we need a collapse i don't see any other
solution there is no we cannot whatever whatever they make up and fake money and new monetary
systems and digital currents etc that nothing you cannot create prosperity out of air thin air
and that's what they're trying to do and therefore the the the the printing
will just lead to the final collapse which is inevitable and always happen in history
the currencies currencies don't just decline they go to zero every time uh every time in
history there's no currency in history that has ever survived remember that all currencies have
gone to zero uh and and we have now seen an era since 1971 when every single currency has gone
down between 97 and 99 percent and i'm measuring that in gold terms of course because gold is the
only uh stable purchasing power uh and therefore uh the the the only money that has ever survived
in history so so we have to go through this final no there was as i said 97 to 99 percent down we
have to go through the final one to three percent uh you know the collapse uh of the currency system
and with that we'll also the the the the debt system collapses there's no chance of its of
surviving no debts will ever be repaid as i said federal debt banking debt to private debt nothing
would be repaid no one can afford to repay we're just increasing it exponentially now and i've
mentioned in an article i need to do a couple of times and you know what happens with exponential
moves uh you know the the i've taken the example of a stadium that is being filled with water one
drop the first minute two drops a second for eight doubles every minute and it you know it takes
nobody can understand it takes about 50 minutes for the stadium to fill full by just a drop you
know one drop two drops four drops a second drop etc um but what is interesting is that after 45
minutes if you ask people how how full do you think the pool is or the stadium is uh well nobody
guesses but it's actually only seven percent full after 45 minutes so it's the line the last five
minutes it goes from from um seven percent pool to a hundred percent and i think that's where we are
now and and therefore we're going to we're going to see we can see now how debt now goes up uh
exponentially um and you know i forecast when trump was elected i said that you know that the
debt will be within at the eight years later the debt will be 40 trillion i said it was 20
then we uh we need to go over and um so we're not going to at the end of this year we we might be
just under 40 trillion but that's you know easy one and we got that basically in the u.s on average
doubles every eight years federal debt uh that takes us to 100 trillion in in 2036 100 trillion
debt and let us say that i which i believe that interest rates can also be high i think they're
going up again uh they're 10 percent which is not unusual in history i remember 20 percent on my or
21 of my first mortgage in the uk in 1973 so you know we say 10 percent interest on 100 trillion
debt for the u.s um that's going to be bankruptcy only that so you know we have to it won't work you
can't write off debt because if you write off debt uh you have to the assets that the debt is backing
backing will also go to zero so therefore this has to collect collapse the system whether we like it
or not we have to get down to much lower level and then start to grow from there with the sound growth
and and it's only at that point the good leaders come in and now i will go back to you know what
can be done uh and we're not going to have any good leaders now we have there's not a single
statesmen in the world right now certainly not in the west you know we could argue that um
putin is the biggest statement but he's hated by anyone so just mentioning his name
means that you know nobody um will agree with that but but certainly uh there is not a single statement
um uh in the west and and sadly you take the biggest economy in the world and until now the
mightiest uh the u.s. doesn't have a leader today uh that who leads the country it's very sad you
know we're all going to get old uh you know i i'm not much younger than Biden and i but i just hope
that my wife or my colleagues will tell me this you know we've had enough of you now
you know you're talking not you're talking nonsense and and they're gonna kick me out
because i but this is what i'm saying there's a lack of leadership and i don't see this ending
well i don't see anyone you know you look at one president builds the wall um the other one turns
it down and opens it up you know it's typical there's no consistency anywhere uh and as we've
said countries um the migration we talked about it but but you know countries have no policy for
anything including migration that there's absolutely you know that countries are leaderless
uh and and and therefore there is no chance in my view to have an ordinary uh uh restructuring of the
world economy or the world political situation i mean you just take the war uh the war's going on
now why is the why is no one trying to start peace talks only only the u.s which is still not
for long i think the mightiest country in the world militarily but i think that's not that's
already slowly or quickly uh evaporating but but you know but somebody should start these peace
negotiations but nobody's interested oh you know the world wants more than the people who are
pulling the strings of biden uh they want more war um and they were they were as we know this
is a war of the u.s against russia not the u.s not ukraine against russia uh and the same in
israel so so you know sadly but there's not there's not a leader who who actually can can
take the lead here and do something about it and that's why it's going to end badly all of
this will end badly you know geopolitically i'm i'm quite worried about situation uh as well and
then financially or economically we're also uh as i said there's no solution no one's coming up with
solution because there is no solution uh on the on the economic side so therefore i just see that
we have to go through this very very very serious downturn or collapse if you want it's a horrible
word collapse but but that's the only solution that's the only basis on which we can actually
then create the green shoots again and uh and then you know just like we got thatcher and reagan
in the early 1980s uh you know at that point at when we're at the bottom that's when strong
leaders will come in again um so in the meantime we will suffer adam the world will suffer in my
view and as i said i'm not pessimistic generally as an individual but you know the risk that i look at
now i don't see a solution to that and that's very sad then we can come to the personal side
what we do there etc we can discuss later that's another matter how we deal with it personally
but for the world i don't quite see that there is a solution okay um well egon you talked about
a lot of things i want to touch on there but but the key takeaway from from what you just said there
is you get to a point in the system you know you can early enough in a system you have lots of
options right and if there's a problem brewing you can change your behavior and perhaps avoid
the problem but then there's an event horizon right where if you haven't changed your behavior
or trajectory you get to a certain point of progression where you pass the event horizon
and you now no longer can avoid the problem right the problem is going to happen and so what you need
to do is switch into management mode which is okay if this is going to happen what am i going to do
about it and you talked about exponentials um in my previous life spent an awful lot of time in that
world dealt with that exact model of the uh the exponential water dropper in the stadium that you
talked about so you're very right in an exponential system things speed up as time goes on right and
so it's very critical to know when you're past the event horizon because if you're wasting your time
trying to avoid a problem that is inevitable at this point it's time wasted what you should be
doing is spending your time on managing the outcome okay if this is going to happen how do i
make sure i get least impacted by it right and um what's interesting is just your point about bad
leadership and whatnot like we're not having the discussion in many cases about whether we have a
problem or not on so many of these issues and in many of them we're past the event horizon here so
there's a lot of kind of you know reshuffling of deck chairs on the titanic if you like going on
when the iceberg is looming ever closer here so you know an important part of this discussion that
we're about to get to is okay what can individuals do to make themselves less vulnerable to what
might be coming down the road um but i do want to reiterate your your important point that in that
that stadium um you know when you when you can see the infield get covered with water
right that's when you begin to realize you have a problem but your point is is that happened at
minute 45 by minute 50 the stadium's already completely submerged right so in many cases by
the time the problem is actually visual way too long to really do much about it you know you just
got to get in hunker down mode so i feel like that's sort of where we are um last point on this
you talked about um the lack of of good leaders right now you mentioned the fourth turning i
interviewed neil howe not that long ago and i asked him specifically about this you know i
said look there were plenty of other times in history where we face challenges and i can
rattle off a lot of great names from history of leaders that emerged to to help come up with a
solution i said look around right now i'm not really seeing many leaders of that caliber did
we just get a bum crop this time around and he said no not really he said maybe this gives you
a little little optimism he said when the pressure gets great enough they will get thrust to the
forefront so that's how it always works and you know the pressure just hasn't gotten great enough
yet for the great leaders who are going to carry us out of this to get identified yet and and i
guess that's a two-edged sword because it means things have to get worse uh before we see those
people but his confidence was pretty good that we'll eventually see them uh they're just not
the conditions aren't yet bad enough uh to to birth them yet um but anyway so as we as we get
into um you know the fact that you said look the system is just going to have to collapse break
down whatever to the point where something better will emerge from it so of course the breakdown is
going to be really rough um i think you've given a good sense of sort of where you expect the pain
to be felt most um i want to talk in just a moment about what people can do but very quickly let's
stick with the financial side of things for a second so let's say the currencies go to zero
the way that you said that has happened many times throughout history what do you see replacing it
this time around do we go back to some sort of physical backed system do the new digital
technologies play a role in some way shape or form is there something else that comes to the
forefront what do you see well the there there is no miracle cure for this you know the digital
system that the world is talking about it's just another form of fiat money and and is no solution
whatsoever they will try that you know during this final collapse they will try all kinds of
funding money and say no you know we the old dollar debt is gone and we have now the new
dollar and and that will solve everything but it's just another form of printed money that cannot
solve anything you know i i disagree with of course new strong leaders will come up at some
point but i disagree with neil how they're not going to solve the problem the world has never
been as far as i know in a situation where globally every single major economy is indebted
to to the extent that they can never get out of it china has a better chance of getting out of their
debt situation because it's more uh domestic than for any other country i.e they're they're not
boring across borders so therefore they can settle it internally but they will suffer like everybody
else so so i don't think that there is a solution i i know i'm i i sound pessimistic but you know
that the fact is that there's don't no one should believe that this debt will ever be repaid because
it's impossible and if it isn't repaid the financial system and the world economy will
collapse it's as simple as that because you can't live on a on a debt mountain and and and eat the
debt because that's that's the all there is to eat in the end because we cannot we cannot afford it
anything else but but you know it's it's um it's like let me just jump over to energy we're also
got to the end of an energy system we are actually at peak energy because the the cost of producing
the energy cost of producing energy is now so high that we actually have a declining return on energy
that which is also you know the world is actually prospering not from from hard work or or uh or
inventions that helps but a bit we have to have the energy and no one should believe that getting
rid of fossil fuels can ever solve the situation 83 fossil fuels today the world is dependent on
and that's going to take a long long time and and and you know all the alternative sources of that
energy i hope that will happen but it'll take a lot longer than anybody believes if you know if
you could if you could replace fossil fuels by wind energy for example you know then you know
didylus and ichoros the two the greek the father and the son who who created the you know who were
flying and that had some some wax to attach the wings and and then got too close to the sun and
crashed um and died you know if wind energy would have worked uh already in those uh greek greek
mythology you know then they would have been billionaires already then wind energy the problem
is you can't store anything else with fossil fuel okay we're getting out on a tangent but what i'm
saying is that on top of all the financial problems and the social problems and the political problem
we also have a major energy problem in the world that no one is talking about but we are actually
looking at peak energy uh and i'm only talking about fossil fuels because all the rest
i said will take a long long time before it can actually replace fossil fuels if that's ever
possible um sure long long term it may be possible but nothing there's nothing we see today except
for nuclear energy and that can replace fossil fuels so that therefore you know i i think we
are i don't see any solutions for the world and i don't see any new leaders who are going to come
up with miracle solutions uh and leaders only leaders in in a democratic world and you can't
you can doubt you could question if we have a democracy today in the western country but leaders
in democratic countries they have one purpose that's to be re-elected and to be re-elected
they have to buy votes and to buy votes they have to spend money and the only way now
is by issuing more debt because there is no money you know we're not we don't have
services to spend every every time every leader spends money today sending money to ukraine
sending money to israel sending money to the poor it's all printed money we don't have the money
and a new leader is not going to be able to create that money either and we'll we're never
you know remember that has gone from actually nothing 50 years ago um to as i said 300 trillion
plus contingent liabilities plus the derivatives etc so you know we're not gonna we're not gonna
ever reduce that debt so then it has to implode and and there'll be no leader no leader in the
world who can ever uh you know create a miracle and make all of that disappear and life goes on
i go on about this because but but it is you know nobody's focusing on the solution and nobody will
because politically that's suicide so everybody will have a solution uh every every opposition
leader will have a solution uh and when he gets into power he'll be as useless as the one who's
running in the country now so yeah you know i don't want to be pessimistic but but that's that's
to me it's a it's a that is a fact um it's only question of time it things take longer than you
expect and and you know this could take much longer than we all expect but at the same time
we are getting to that final you know the the final five minutes now in uh in the world economy
and uh all that stadium being filled and that can happen so quickly so therefore we could see now
things accelerating uh starting in 24 for example okay um i'm gonna return to my question and just
ask it a slightly different way um i agree with everything that you've said um also spent a fair
amount of my time in the whole you know net energy uh space as well so i very much understand what
you're talking about there so let's play out the remaining five minutes they have happened we're
at minute 50 um everything that was going to kind of break has broken right um presumably as long
as the planet is still here it'll still rotate and the sun will come up in the morning so currencies
may be destroyed debt may have collapsed right um what does come next you know putting on your your
realist but optimist hat if you will like what emerges after from this what do you think are the
more sustainable solutions that emerge from the rubble so uh yeah own currencies of course as we
said before uh even the since since no currency has survived there's always been a new currency
coming out in the meantime people depending on where and at what time in history you know people
go back to barter it's possible that in in the transition between the existing monitoring system
and the new one we will have barter it's possible that you know gold will play a role or silver
also but you know the the problem is there are a few too few people who own gold and silver
today for it to to become a viable money for buying little things um so i i would expect
there'll be more more of a barter system and and gold and silver will play a role but but
not in a major not a major role for for eight billion people in the world because remember
that uh the the world financial asset gold represents today only 0.5 so so it's not
widely owned at all so so i think there will be some temporary money that always has been you know
when the weimar republic uh collapsed uh they come came out with the rent in my you know the
based on property values so so when the crisis starts the governments will come up
new money and then and then they will establish a new currency and in the meantime people will
just manage by by as i said by bartering by my begging uh by getting handouts or whatever
so uh and then we will have new currency systems in in most countries again that's what happened
always throughout history so i don't see uh any difference now but it's not going to be you know
i hope i don't i don't like having gold back uh currencies because automatically that will
lead to governments cheating uh and i would rather have that gold was uh you know the gold was real
gold uh and and not backing a currency but still representing constant purchasing power and
governments new governments will not base a new system on debt people will be so afraid of debt
for the next 50 years i promise you because no no i won't any new leader will not dare to even talk
about debt more than to in a very very small uh portions uh so so therefore we will have a sound
system for a long time before the cycle turns around again uh but but until then yeah in in
between there'll be there'll there'll be a panic there will be people don't have will not have any
money at all people will i you know you talk about population or someone you talk about people will
suffer of course we'll be suffering uh the world population has grown from from about a billion in
in 1850 to eight billion today um that's also an exponential growth because you know it went to a
billion it took thousands of years before you slowly got up to a billion and now it's eight
billion that exponential that's a spike straight up spikes never end well on a big sample so i see
world population coming down also certainly and you know whether it comes down by four billion or
i half or whatever i have no idea but you know if i just look at it from from a chart point of view
that it has to be correction whether that is economic circumstances famine war
vaccines or whatever it is uh you know social uh unrest civil war etc where we don't know but i
could see that and also there'll be there'll be mystery for for a number of years if all of this
happens that i'm forecasting that in itself will mean that you know there will be less people born
so we will have a declining world population um and how quickly that happens will depend on
of course what kind of disease or what kind of war we get but you know you took you took the the dark
ages um uh not the dark age well we had the the pest in in europe in the 1300s and it was worldwide
also but population was estimated to go down by 50 so you know it's not unusual to see these
kind of corrections in world population either and as i said we have enough reasons for it to happen
so there will be less people around there will be less money around and there will be new currencies
of systems coming like i always ask it because every currency always has gone to zero which
means there's always been a new currency issued and i think it will be again a government currency
whether it will be digital or not i don't know but it won't be a printed one i don't i i don't
think they will go into debt because they will be scared stiff of actually uh having a debt-based
system again when they just got out of work so that's what i see okay all right um so uh we go
through the panic we go through the point where maybe you know there isn't much money to go around
but then eventually some sort of sounder money comes out of it um not fiat not debt-based
because people are so scarred from what debt created for them and and that's where
you know that's what's most likely to emerge at least initially on the other side of this thing
wish we could get there without the panic and from the tough times in the interim
um but i'm not sure if humans are wired that way um all right well look so um you know you've
you've got a relatively uh dire message i guess here for for the general populace which is hey
look um we're gonna have some troubling times ahead um now let's get to the point where the
individual has some agency in this story um they can't control what happens to the global pile of
debt they can't decide what the world governments and central planners decide to do but they can
basically put on their own oxygen masks first right so um what would some of your recommendations be
i'm assuming getting some exposure to gold and silver probably something uh you're going to
recommend um true and if so what else above and beyond that yes well obviously we started where
i started at our business now which is called national asset management or url it's called
switzerland um and started that just uh beginning of this century and um for the simple reason that
we started for ourselves and a few friends and we were advising uh that we saw these risks and we
decided that uh you know we were not we are not still we're not still not gold bugs we were just
looking at the best way of protecting against the risks that that uh i saw coming um and then of
course you have to remember that 71 gold went from 35 to 850 in in in 1980 um and then it slowly
declined for 20 years to 250 in 1999 so when we went in which was 2002 we still we were watching
it for a while 2002 goals 300 and then we went in and bought gold uh for ourselves and for the
people we were advising at the time um uh so that was never meant as a business but then people
started asking us can you help us too because we created a system with holding physical gold you
know in your own name no counterparty then outside the banking system in the sacred war
dealing directly with the uh refiners who buy gold from them etc and then we set up a company based
on that and now now there's a business of where we you know which is global and we are probably
the biggest when it comes to um high net worth individuals holding physical gold outside the
banking system one of our vaults is in swiss alps which is the biggest private gold vault in the
world so so um you know we we have and we've done this gradually and slowly but we have a passion
for helping people uh to preserve wealth now you you can say that okay we cater for people who are
have a certain wealth for example our mountain vault is a minimum of five million but
you know our other vaults are four hundred thousand dollars still they're very high
but you know there are other people uh and we can recommend people who who start much much much
lower and you take argentina no i mean i meant venezuela there's venezuela and the boulevard
so people around 2000 they could have bought the the boulevard was about the same as a dollar
uh they could have bought gold for nothing basically and that would have saved them today
and they could have just bought you know a little bit uh and that would have taken care of them and
their family for a long time to come i met somebody in a restaurant in the italian part of switzerland
um a couple of years ago and he said i know you obviously i know you i'm full my friend you should
listen to him he's he's into gold and he said well he said i i he came from from yugoslavia this man
and and he was the restaurant owner now and he said i lived through the inflation hyperinflation
yugoslavia and i had some gold the rest of my family didn't they lost everything and i managed
to get out of yugoslavia and and get a by a restaurant here here in switzerland and you know
what i'm saying is that you don't have to be wealthy to put some of your money into gold
it can be grams of gold or you know fractions of ounces or it can be uh ounces of silver which
costs today 25 for an ounce of silver if you do that today with the way i see the world developing
and the cars is collapsing that will save you and give you uh an nest egg which will last you for a
long time when the crisis starts so saving in gold and silver is for everyone not just for the rich
you know you could skip that last cup coffee that you uh you buy a costa coffee whatever wherever
you go or the pack of cigarettes or the last beer you know put it into if you put a little bit of
silver or or or a little bit of gold uh so that's one way for people uh uh for bigger investors who
said that we we helped them to put it into the safest places so um that's an obvious way of
protecting against the risks that we see today and you know we went in 2000 gold in most currencies
are up seven to eight times since 2000 and i think we have just seen the beginning of the rise of the
precious mass and i see the acceleration phase and it doesn't we don't care about the short-term moves
we don't look at the price short term uh we see how much gold we owe uh we and our investors don't
own whether it's you know a gram or an ounce whatever it is that's what counts not the daily
price it is irrelevant you don't buy gold to make money you buy gold and silver to protect your
wealth and protect against the risks that now are greater than ever in history that's how we see it
so that's what people should do and and then put it away and just use a little bit of those
savings a little bit more you know if you look at stocks against gold now i think stocks will decline
against gold by more than 95 percent in coming years and and silver will be poor man's gold
silver would also go up dramatically probably faster than gold or probably twice as fast as
gold but silver is very volatile and it goes when it corrects it corrects also twice as fast
so it's not for whether it's north and silver a bit of silver is all right but i think more gold
gold is the king of the metals and that's a much safer method to hold so so so that that's clearly
what people should do uh at any levels and not just the wealthy people now what else can people
do well of course you can you know if you have if you want to but most people won't even buy a bit
of food food and dry food that lasts a number of years etc if you want because there will be food
shortages there's no question about that and you know there will be there will be people who will
not get enough to eat so to have a bit of food spare food will obviously be beneficial but then
i think the most important thing adam for because as i said before a lot of people will suffer
the most important thing is to help people uh and and if you have the ability and that does can be
they can be helped just helping the elderly with shopping or whatever or it can be helping people
if you if you have a bit of spare money with cash uh i mean i see already now people around us
suffering already see people actually who are now make them having problems making ends meet because
prices you know inflation is not three or four percent in america it's absolute nonsense of
course you know if your people look at what they buy on a daily basis food and set right it's going
up all the time um and and and therefore you know we have high inflation and if i believe that
inflation will come back again um and i also believe therefore that interest rates will go up
again they might be down for the next six months or so correcting uh but the the long trend of
interest rates uh ended two three years ago the downtrend from 1980 to 2021 or so and the long
travel the longer trend is up of interest rates and up of inflation so that's going to make it
more difficult also for people and uh and but as said helping family and friends is the most
important thing you can do now we you know when it comes to it and i often say this it's not money is
important we need money to have a bit of food in the roof over our heads but then you know there's
so many things in life that are free uh friendship obviously uh family music nature sports uh and
books etc you know there's so many things we don't we don't need food you know one ipad one one phone
and three cars etc etc we don't need all of that you know i remember i mean i'm you know i remember
growing up in in the 50s all housewives work husbands earned a fraction obviously what they
earned today uh and and car was was exceptional to have and we all managed uh but now everybody
spends so much money on things that we don't really need and i think the good thing about
bad times coming is we get back to real values again uh the transition will be very very difficult
and hard but at least then we come back to again the family found family becoming the kernel
society because we will need each other and we will need close friends uh and you know that
that's a positive effect of all this the uh horrible things i see happening um and you know
life is all about having a close family and and friends but sadly it's been forgotten about in in
this uh uh monetary capitalistic uh era that we're in now but as i said i i think coming back to that
will be good for the world and sadly we will have to suffer a bit uh to get to that point
well very well said egon um i've talked a lot on this channel about um well a few things one
i've been asking a lot of my recent guests for a non-monetary um investment they would encourage
people to adopt in their lives i think you just gave your answer there which is is one of the best
ones i think which is investing in community investing in the relationships that matter to you
folks here on this channel have heard me mentioned often uh centenarian advice which is if you go on
youtube and you type in centenarian uh advice you you get interviews with people who live to be over
100 and they ask them you know okay you've done life what matters and what's interesting is they
always say the same three things and the number one one is always relationships which you just
brought up we're social creatures at the end of the day uh and the the quality of the relationships
that we have in our life those are the things that we really value uh when we're at the end
and reflecting back on what really mattered most so you're you're giving great validation to that
i also just want to underscore for folks too um egon is a very successful man um he is a man who
understands the the benefits of what wealth can bring financial wealth can bring but also its
limitations and i think the fact egon that you are placing such a preeminence on just good values and
family and relationships speaks more than anything i could ever say about it so thank you for for
being can i just mention something here you know a good friend of mine in the gold industry was
jim sinclair who was called mr gold uh during his lifetime he had more knowledge of golden than all
the experts together in the world today and um so i i had the privilege of knowing him and meeting
several times and once i sent him a photo of my family and grandchildren and he wrote back to me
and said so that you know that's more worth than all the gold in the world he said and and i agree
with that absolutely you know got it's all family and friendship that's what makes life fantastic
you know okay we have to money enough for food etc and for a group but but you know if we if we
add understand the real value of relationships as you also pointed out you know that's what makes
life worth living more than anything else all right well look in in wrapping up here um egon
i could i could keep going for hours here with you um uh so we we we touched on this really briefly
but just very quickly i'd like to get your full answer on it if we haven't gotten already which is
totally hear you that you you don't buy gold to become rich you buy cold to protect your wealth
from all the things that we've been talking about um that said gold as we're talking here is is
really back trading it pretty close to its all-time highs there's a lot of talk about gold perhaps
having a very good year ahead of it here for a number of different reasons do you believe that
the world is perhaps starting to get the memo of the issues that you've talked about here and if so
what do you think that's going to do to the price of gold from here
yes i think number one as you said and as i've been saying gold is for wealth preservation
not not for short-term gains or trading and our our people who invest through us um they are buyers
of gold not sellers some people put all their money to gold so therefore they sell off a bit
when they need it but but um i think gold will not just preserve your wealth in coming years
it's not just next year we're talking about many many years you know gold is going to enhance
your wealth dramatically in coming years also because we have now had a very long period of
gold being kept at a very low level and i i think the next era now of gold starting to run away
is is is probably starting into in 24 and probably in a bigger way not that i
care about uh the price as i said but i think that that's likely to happen but um
you know as as regards the gold price i i never i mean i did in the when i restarted i think i
said that i go go around two thousand two three four five i said gold will um probably reach
ten thousand in today's money i said then and so that's but now i don't make any forecast because
it is totally meaningless to make a forecast of the gold price in the currency that goes to
zero goes down so you know tell me the what one dollar will will buy um instead in in five years
time you know you could you could measure golden or you're in chickens or whatever that would be
better than that than in dollars but at least you have something stable also that you can eat
but so therefore don't look at the gold price i don't i'm not going to give you a forecasting gold
all i'm telling you is that and the money that you value everything in gold will go up to levels that
no one can believe today because the value of your money will go down dramatically and that's that
was that's what count what counts and that's why you're holding gold and not to make money but to
protect against uh fiat money that that is going to have no value uh in coming years all right well
very well said all right well in wrapping up here egon for folks that have really enjoyed this
conversation maybe this is their first time getting to meet you uh where can they go to
follow you and your work so we we have our website which is goldswitzerland.com goldswitzerland.com
and that's where we have um you know that we're all about of course what we do for people
and also uh articles and interviews that we do especially this matt matt piperberg myself
matt matt is absolutely superb in talking about these things all of about um the world world
economy and then gold um and and so very very fortunate to have him on our team and and i think
people who want to understand what's happening are in the world from a financial point of economic
point of view uh and how that relates to to money and gold i i think they will get a lot out of
going to our website goldswitzerland.com to see some of our work okay great and egon when i edit
this i will put up the link to gold switzerland uh right here on the screen so folks know exactly
where to go folks i'll put a link in the description too so you can get a one-click access
there if you want um all right well look just in wrapping up here if you've enjoyed this conversation
with egon we'd like for him to come back on the channel again at some point in 2024 uh to give us
an update on where he sees things please let him know that by hitting the like button then clicking
on the red subscribe button below as well as that little bell icon right next to it um and uh and
just in quickly wrapping up here um if you've got a little bit more stamina you folks uh it's always
great to to tap the expertise of folks like egon who have um you know been in in the markets um
been following the macro story for their long careers have seen a lot of different cycles and
really have that expertise uh if you'd like to hear from one other person who fits that bill
uh just released an interview with jim rogers i'll put up a link to that right here uh you
can watch that after this one if you like um egon i can't thank you enough it's been great
conversation really i've enjoyed meeting you for the first time uh best 20 of 2024s for you and
like i said i'd love to have you back on the channel again later this year thank you adam i

can't do anything about the world but we certainly can have an influence on our own lives and that's
what we should focus on all right well very well said thank you so much my friend everybody else
thanks so much for watching
