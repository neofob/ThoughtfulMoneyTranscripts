Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
Inflation for January rose higher than expected.
Is this a one off blip or is it a sign that the remaining inflation in the system is sticky
and going to prove harder for the Federal Reserve to get under control?
Some analysts have been warning that we may be falling into the same trap as we did in
the 1970s, which saw a series of roller coaster surges and drops in inflation until Fed chair
Paul Volcker was forced to rise interest rates up to a crippling 20% to get prices under
control.
Is that kind of pain possibly in our future?
To find out, we're fortunate to hear today from Michael Leibowitz, portfolio manager
at Real Investment Advice.
He works closely with Lance Roberts who regular viewers see on this channel with me every
Saturday.
Michael, thanks so much for joining us today.
Great to be here again.
Alright, well, Michael, look, always great talking with you.
Thanks so much for coming on.
We are going to talk bonds a little bit, but I really want to spend a lot of time talking
about inflation because you wrote a pretty detailed series on this exact topic.
Very quickly for folks, I just want to give a quick note that you are going to be participating
in the upcoming Thoughtful Money Conference, well, actually in 31 days from now on Saturday,
March 16th, you're going to go really deep into bonds there.
So we're going to have sort of a high level conversation on bonds here in this discussion,
but then we're going to go really deep into your forecasts at the conference itself.
Sounds good.
Alright, so to kick things off here, let's start with a question I love to ask you every
time you come on at the beginning.
What's your current assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
So it's interesting you're asking me that because we just found out Japan and the UK
just slipped into a recession, two technical recession, two consecutive quarters of negative
growth.
Germany slipped into a recession when they reported their GDP, I think it was a couple,
two, three weeks ago.
So who are the top six nations based on economy?
Well, US is far and away number one, then comes China, and then it's those three countries
I mentioned, UK, Germany, Japan, and India.
China is growth is stagnating.
Their growth rate is still decently high.
So for them, going into a recession would be pretty hard, but getting down to something
like two, three, 4% growth is sort of recessionary for them.
So what's left is India, and we can deal with that one another day, but basically the major
economic powers, except for the US, are in a recession.
So it's interesting, you look at the small business surveys, they're telling you it's
a recession.
You look at regional manufacturing surveys, they've been in a recession for well over
a year now.
So if this is the data you had, I'd be telling you we're in a recession or we're going to
be entering one very, very soon.
But you look at the data and it's not recessionary at all.
It's a very robust economy, employment's at a near a 50 year low.
Some sectors are doing decently well.
So you know, I think we are still coming in for a landing.
I don't think this Goldilocks notion will come to fruition.
The question in my mind is how hard or soft is the landing?
And I think a lot of that just depends on it.
A lot of it is just consumer behavior, psychology, and a lot of it is kind of the Fed's reaction
function and of course, how the government reacts via stimulus.
All right.
Well, Michael, as they say, collapse happens from the periphery in where it's the weaker
players that fall first and then you progressively have bigger and bigger players fail as you
get into the biggest one.
In this case, US being the biggest one.
You know, we're at the part in the story where it sounds like a number of the big players
in our peer set are beginning to be forced to their knees in terms of having some sort
of landing.
You just mentioned the three countries that are now in recession, at least technical recession.
We're going to find out how hard their landings are, I think over the next couple of quarters.
But you know, obviously the big question that's being raised is, will the US buck that trend
or are these dominoes that are falling and they're going to topple us eventually too?
You know, I think the data is mixed, although the headline data right now has been relatively
strong, although we're going to dig into some of the more recent inflation stuff in just
a second.
You know, it's interesting because we've had the emergence of this new no landing or butterfly
soft landing, you know, emerge.
So obviously, if we're due for anything worse than that, that's going to be a surprise to
Wall Street.
You did though mention the Fed's reaction function and the fact that it's an election
year.
And I think there's a confidence out there that no matter what looks like might want
to happen this year, the central planners are just standing at the ready with whatever
it's going to take to keep things going, keep the airplane in the air, preventing it from
having to land, at least until the November presidential elections ahead of us.
Time will tell on that, I guess.
So good question answering my point about where the global economy is, but how about
the financial markets?
How are they striking you given this economic situation you just laid out?
They are reacting to Goldilocks.
I mean, right now you've got a government that is spending a ton of money in a very
good economy.
Typically, the government spends less money in a good economy, more money stimulus in
a bad economy.
They're doing what they shouldn't really be doing.
They're boosting an already decent economy.
The Fed has taken liquidity out of the markets to some degree.
They're certainly keeping rates restrictive to a lot of borrowers.
So the US -- shoot, I'm sorry.
Can we start that over?
Yeah, sure.
I completely forgot your question.
Oh, just the markets.
And you started with a great answer, which is their price for Goldilocks, but yeah.
Okay.
So the question was how are markets reacting?
Okay.
Well, just your thoughts on the financial markets, but certainly in regards to the economic
situation you just laid out.
So the markets are kind of taking its cue from Goldilocks, from this beautiful, wonderful
perfect landing by Jerome Powell.
Can that happen?
Anything's possible, but I think the markets are really basing themselves off of the Fed.
They've seen high rates now for a while.
It hasn't really affected the economy, although I think it will.
I still think the lag effect will hold true.
It's just taking a lot longer because of all the stimulus.
But I think at the end of the day, right now, what's there not to like as an investor?
The government is pumping money into the economy.
Their deficit is extremely high for a robust economy.
We've never really seen anything like this, spending like this when the economy is in
such good shape.
Typically, we see spending like this when we're in a recession or a world war.
But so you have that big tailwind helping us out here.
So I think the markets are kind of primed for Goldilocks, and then on the horizon they
see the Fed's going to be cutting rates.
Now it's wavering back and forth whether they cut in June or March or the end of the year.
But I think they see that as a positive that the Fed's cutting rates.
And this is kind of the distinction, I think this is the market's mind.
The Fed is going to cut rates in a nice environment.
Typically, the Fed cuts rates because the economy is slowing quickly, there's a banking
crisis, there's something going on and the Fed's reacting.
They're cutting rates to react to something.
This time, I think the market thinks the Fed is just going to be doing it because they
were too high for too long, and they're going to bring them back to a rate that's more commensurate
with inflation, with kind of more traditional levels.
And that, in the market's mind, is a good thing.
You got the government pumping in money, you got the Fed that's going to be accommodative
at some point, debatable when, but at some point, and look, even the Fed said they're
going to lower rates two or three times this year.
So the Fed's kind of acquiescing to that point of view as well.
Everything looks perfect.
What could possibly go wrong, Adam?
Well, inflation maybe could go wrong, and we're going to talk about that in just a second.
And so you talk about, well, you mentioned the lag effects, and that's another thing
that could sort of spoil the party, is could the tide of rising liquidity that's been basically
rising since what I think about October of 2022, when the market bottom is when the liquidity
sort of turned around from net negative to net positive.
Could that just continue being the only thing that really matters here up until the elections,
or do things start getting away from the central planners, either because of the lag effects,
or because some of the contributors to that liquidity start getting pulled away?
So we're not getting more fiscal stimulus passed through the system.
We are doing a lot of deficit spending, but it's spending that was already pre-approved.
The employee retention program, which was sort of an adjunct program to the PPP loans
that were out there that was rewarding employers for keeping people employed during the pandemic.
Those funds have been turned off.
We've got the reverse repo program looking like it's running dry.
We have the expiration of the bank term funding program, and still QT going on through this
until it's such time the Fed stops doing that.
So you can make a good argument that there are not black swans, but swans we can see
circling out there that could potentially ruin the party a little bit.
Now again, as we mentioned, it's an election year.
Maybe they don't care and they're just going to do whatever it takes, like I said earlier.
But it's not that there's nothing that could go wrong from here.
There's another big problem that you didn't mention.
Interest rates are still very high.
Coverage rates are around 7%, treasury's borrowing at 4% on up.
Car loans are 7, 8, 9%.
Credit card debt is at whatever it is, 20 something percent.
Corporations now have to pay a lot more for the money.
Now the reason that this is still a problem, you're going to say, "Well, it's been three
years and it hasn't mattered.
Why should it matter now?"
And the reason is, is because let's look at corporations.
Large companies borrowed a ton of money when rates were really low and they basically pushed
out their borrowing needs.
Those borrowing needs will come due at some point.
People have delayed buying cars.
At some point they have to buy a car and they're going to pay that high rate.
Same with houses.
The housing market has been frozen now for what, two years?
Some point people are going to want to sell, have to sell.
People are tired of waiting to buy.
So those lag effects from interest rates are a huge deal and they have yet to truly affect
larger companies and many consumers, but smaller companies are definitely feeling it.
So a couple of things, one on the day you and I were talking here, the January retail
sales numbers just came out and they were pretty horrible.
I think it was the biggest year on year decline that we've seen since early of 2020, when we
shut the global economy down.
So it's a sign that's starting to show some cracks in the narrative we've had out here,
which is the economy is strong and the consumer is strong.
Well, the consumers are now starting to cut back on their spending.
So regular viewers of this channel don't need to hear me beat the drum of the lag effect
because I do it so often here, but I'm concerned about exactly what you've raised here.
And to the point about the Fed cutting this year, all last year, the market just was expecting
the Fed to pivot every time the Fed met.
And the Fed kept saying, "Nope, we're going to be higher for longer.
We're super serious.
We're not going to change policy until we get inflation down where we want it to get."
And the market kept saying, "I don't believe you.
I don't believe you."
And the market always had to adjust its expectations.
It was the market that lost that game of chicken.
And what's so interesting is it didn't matter.
Stocks kept going up all last year.
And again, I see that as probably mostly due to this rising tide of liquidity that then
finally got animal spirits going where they just said, "Hey, you know what?
Forget the lag effect.
It doesn't matter."
Now that the Fed has basically said, "Hey, we've stopped hiking.
Expect cuts from us next.
Market has gone hog wild.
Animal spirits have run amok.
The stock market has melted up."
And I think the market is still pricing in to bring it back down, I think, from seven,
but I think the market's still pricing in like six rate cuts or something like that
this year?
Yeah.
It's still aggressive compared to what the Fed thinks.
Still much more than the Fed is guiding, right?
But to your point, even if the Fed delivers on its three this year, which I think is maybe
getting cast into doubt a little bit now with this most recent inflation data we're about
to talk about, even if the Fed delivers three rate cuts, we're down to what at that point?
Four and three quarters?
Let's be generous and say four and a half.
That's still way more than what the economy was used to paying before the rate hike kicked
in when all those larger companies raised financing, debt financing the last time.
So the point is those rate cuts aren't going to do all that much to ease the burden of
this maturity wall that's coming up, and we've been talking about it for a long time, so
it's been very academic to people.
It's now actually starting to arrive, and in 2024, we'll have almost a trillion dollars
of corporate debt rerate and then more than that in 2025.
So we're really beginning to enter that time phase yet, and what several guests I've had
in the program have said is when that happens, the cost structure of the company goes up,
so if it wants to try to preserve its profit margins, it has to start going to cost cutting
mode, and what these recent experts have been saying is, hey, companies don't wait until
their debt rolls over to start making those cuts.
The CFOs are smart.
They can do basic math, so it's when they're about six months out from having to go back
out and refinance, that's when they start shedding costs in anticipation of the higher
interest costs that they're going to have to spend, so I think that's why we're seeing
so many more, at least so many more companies report that they plan to do layoffs this year.
We've had a huge spike in companies saying that they plan to do layoffs, and we've had
a huge spike in layoffs since the start of this year.
We're actually beginning to see them delivering upon their plans, so until and unless at such
time that interest rates magically come back down to the territory where they were before
or back when the companies took on debt prior, I need someone to tell me why we're not going
to just see more of this play out in terms of companies laying off more and more people
to try to preserve their profit margins.
And I think one reason is why it has been so slow, and really the unemployment rate's
about as low as it's been, is labor hoarding.
Companies are so scared that they can't hire someone if they need them that they're just
holding onto employees that end up costing them more money than they make off that employee,
and that works for a while.
When your earnings are doing well and you can report to shareholders that you're beating
their estimates on both sales and earnings and everything's going swimmingly, you can
afford to kind of prop up some employees that you would typically let go because you don't
know how you're going to replace them for the next cycle.
But I think as time goes on, especially in smaller businesses, and it'll work its way
up to larger businesses, they're realizing you can't just hide, you can't hold onto employees
that don't produce, whatever produce may mean for that company.
And I think, you know, we talked about the Michael Kantrowitz's HOPE framework, it should
be small hop, big E, because this is all about the E. And as soon as employment starts to
show signs of upticking, I think that's when we can start talking about recession potential.
But you know, there are signs that the market is normalizing the number of job openings.
Job hires are really low.
So people aren't hiring, they're just not firing.
Initial jobless claims remain pretty low.
Continuing claims aren't increasing at a great rate.
They're still at a very low number as well.
The BLS numbers are good, ADP number, a private sector number is fine.
It's not great, but they're still growing a hundred thousand a month.
So there's nothing in the E that really alarms us.
You know, you can talk to full-time versus part-time and hours worked and this and that,
and they're all potential warnings, but the canary hasn't cracked over.
The E, the employment is still doing really well.
And it's when people start getting laid off is when behaviors change.
And it's not necessarily when you lose your job, it's when your neighbor or your coworker
lose their job and you're like, "That could be me.
I better spend less.
Let's not go out to dinner tonight.
Let's avoid the movie next Thursday night.
Let's start to save some money.
We don't need a new car this year.
We can wait till next year."
And that's kind of where my biggest focus is on the labor data.
And there's a lot of labor data.
The big one is the BLS, but there's a lot.
And when that starts turning, then we can start trying to figure out what type of landing
this is going to be.
So I totally agree.
And I'd say a lot on this channel, this regular viewers here, that it is all about the E in
the hope framework.
It is all about employment.
And as a reminder to folks, I'm planning on having Michael Kantorowicz back on soon.
In fact, I'm trying to see if I can get maybe him and Eric Besmajian because they both track
a lot of employment data.
It'd be great to get a discussion with the two of them to share what they're seeing in
real time here, given the importance of this.
I just want to underscore my belief here or my understanding and see if you share with
it that this labor hoarding is, it's sort of one of these, the Hemingway quote about
how we went bankrupt slowly and then all at once.
And it's one of these things because it's kind of a belief.
You're saying, okay, look, it's going to net benefit me to hold onto these employees, even
if they're not super productive right now, because the economy cycle will pick back up
at some point.
I don't want to have the cost of having to go back and try to hire them again.
And maybe I've lost a bunch of them to competitors.
And that's what happened.
Generals always fight the last war.
That's what happened to everybody after COVID.
Everybody shed a bunch of workers and it was super hard to get them back again.
So that's the wound in their mind that they still remember.
But it's a belief that that hoarding is in their interest.
Once they get to the point where that belief tips from, oh, this is positive for me to
this is actually a negative for me.
Then they start shedding.
And they start shedding in mass.
Because it begins to become sort of an existential thing for them, especially if they start seeing
others in their peer set start struggling with, they're like, hey, that could be me.
I got to take advanced action to make sure that hopefully I don't have to experience
what they're going through.
So I just want to make sure that folks who hear us talk about this understand we're worried
about it.
Because once it does happen, the bad tends to happen at a very rapid speed relative to
the build up.
Right.
If you look at graphs of unemployment, it kind of turns slowly and then it shoots higher.
And has that cycle been broken?
Obviously every other cycle seems to have been broken.
But I'm old school, I still think that when unemployment starts taking up, it's going
to start taking up at a pretty decent rate.
OK.
We are going to get it in a bit to your market outlook.
But kind of on this topic, just asking you to prognosticate here.
Given all the uncertainty here in 2024, are your expectations such that it's going to
be a rockier road for all the reasons we're talking about than the market is currently
expecting?
I think it will be economically or market wise, or both.
Both.
Yeah.
I think it's generally going to be a rocky road for both markets and for the economy.
I think the unemployment rate does start ticking up at some point, how much and how quickly.
It's hard to tell.
I mean, this economy has been strong and robust.
And I've been very late, I keep calling for a recession, it doesn't happen.
So you got to give some benefit of the doubt to the economy and to the stimulus and to
everything else that's propping up the economy.
But also remember, we have an election.
And it's not funny, but the sad part of this election is that typically when you know who
the two candidates are, those are the two candidates.
There's no question in anyone's mind who those candidates are.
Well, come May, you got Super Tuesday in March, come May, Biden and Trump will have pretty
much, they're the two candidates.
I don't think anyone can tell you with 100% certainty that they're going to be the ones
running in November.
So I think there's a lot of uncertainty with ultimately who's running.
Biden's a kind of a known commodity at this point.
Trump is not a known, even though he was a president, he's not a known commodity.
So I think there's going to be a lot of volatility, both economic people saying, look, I don't
know what's going to happen after this election.
My guy's not going to win.
That's not good for the economy.
You know, we've seen these confidence polls.
Democrats are a lot more confident than Republicans that those may flip if it becomes obvious
that Trump or some other Republican may win.
So I think people will kind of say, you know what, let's just save a little bit of money
here because we don't know who's going to win this election and what that means for
the economy.
And I think the market, same thing, whenever you introduce unknowns, you create volatility.
So as if we didn't have enough unknowns right now between kind of the Fed and then kind
of geopolitical affairs, you're throwing a kind of a crazy election into the whole mix.
And it's also the House and Senate could both flip or not flip.
So it's not just the president, it's the whole makeup of Washington.
All right.
Well, and as we know, markets hate uncertainty, right?
So if that uncertainty persists, then our consumers, consumers don't like uncertainty
either.
So that's the point.
And corporations don't.
So it's not just the markets and the effect that has on consumers, but it's also the effect
that it actually the uncertainty itself has on consumers.
So obviously, the more uncertain they feel, they probably tight rein in their purse strings.
Exactly.
And then that impacts the economy because we're 70% consumer spending driven.
So let me ask you this.
So yes, election year, as I've said several times, I think there's a lot of people out
there that just say, "Look, don't worry.
The powers that be will do whatever they can to keep things as stable as possible up until
November."
But you and I here, we're still kind of debating whether the lag effect is going to arrive
from things that happened a year and a half, two years ago.
And they haven't arrived yet.
And monetary policy in general acts with a lag that's measured in quarters.
It's usually like somewhere between nine to 16 months is when the lever gets pulled traditionally
that you see it out in the wild in the economy because it takes so long to express itself,
which is why there's a term lag.
So let's say that all of a sudden things start getting rocky in a month or two and they want
to keep things happy up until the election.
Is there much they can actually do then that can prevent natural forces from pushing things
around before the election or does not their reaction have a lag to it as well?
I think, and this is Bernanke's theory, that at the end of the day, if they cut rates,
it doesn't really matter.
It's not going to have a big effect.
There is some effect, but there's a big lag effect to lower rates just as there are to
higher rates.
But I think it's in sentiment.
So let's say that the Fed starts to get concerned and they cut rates 50 basis points, 50 basis
points again.
They ultimately bring them down by one and a half percent.
Stock market goes wild.
That boosts confidence and that can help offset whatever kind of weakness there is in the
economy.
Yeah, I think that the Fed can potentially do that, assuming that they continue to unleash
the animal spirits, but that's a big unknown.
So let me pull on that thread with you just for a second.
So let's say they do that.
And I agree with you, they can push optics around and the stock market, at least portions
of it, react much more quickly to policy changes, expecting that eventually it's going to be
manifested in the economy.
So let's say that happens.
Let's say the Fed comes and says, "Hey, you know what?
We're doing five cuts this year, not three."
And let's say the stock market says, "Awesome, we're having a party based off of that.
We're heading into the election."
I use the stat all the time, but I think it's 93% of all stocks are owned by the top 10%
of households.
So my question is, is that really going to change the voting behavior all that much?
Because I believe, and my belief, that most people vote based upon how they're feeling
in the moment.
And even if the stock market's having a party, for a lot of America, it doesn't really matter
to them, just not that relevant to them.
And to a certain extent, there may be a growing resentment of those rich bastards who are
just getting, basically, policy is rewarding the rich, and man, look at the party they're
having right now in the markets, and regular schmoes like me are just hanging on by our
fingernails here.
So would it actually even really affect the outcome of the election?
I don't think in any marginal way.
The only reason, though, that you have to say possibly is because I think it's going
to be such a tight election that anything, that any swaying of voters to one side or
the other can affect it.
Just a third party candidate, Kennedy or whoever else, can just skew it by just enough in just
a couple of states that it can change the election.
So I guess the answer is I think it can, but it's hard to know in which way, probably until
you see in hindsight what happened.
All right.
I don't know.
The more people I talk to you about this year, I just think it's going to be one big giant
hairball.
It's going to be very interesting to see what happens.
And obviously, that's why we want to have smart people like you coming back on this
channel again often to kind of keep us grounded on what you're seeing in real time.
OK.
Well, look, let's get to the main event here, which is inflation.
So as I said in the intro, the recent inflation data that came out for January was a surprise
to the analysts who were expecting it to be a bit lower.
We've had a lot of discussion about how kind of the 80/20 rule, getting CPI down from nine
to three something, it took a fair amount of work, but presumably that was kind of the
easy work.
And now to get from three something down to two, which is where the Fed has said it still
is that's its target come hell or high water, that that's going to be harder and harder
to do.
I'm sure the Fed didn't like this most recent number that came out because it just shows
that it's not as close as it wants to be to achieving its mission.
How material is this?
And use your answer there as a segue into the question of your larger body of work that
you've done recently, which is could we be setting ourselves up for another 1970s where
a lot of people said the Fed would tighten but then stop its work too early, declare
a victory too early, and then inflation would resume, forcing the Fed to get back in and
having to tighten even more.
And that happened a couple of times until Volcker finally got the mandate to just do
whatever it took.
And it took a lot back then.
I said the maximum was 20% interest rates.
Do you see us potentially running into that type of risk again, or is it different this
time?
So yeah, we'll start with the recent CPI data and then move back 50 years to the '70s.
So first of all, let's just start with the basics.
You can't calculate inflation.
So it's an impossible number to calculate, and the BLS does a pretty poor job of even
trying to estimate what it is.
And then any economic data on a month-to-month basis is skewed.
Retail sales were for January, the bad number we just got.
December was a good number.
There are so many seasonal adjustments and so many seasonal behavioral patterns that
change every year that you can't base any kind of fact on one number.
You need to see trends.
Inflation has been trending lower now for quite a while.
It popped up a little bit last Tuesday.
So let's dive into that.
Is inflation really becoming sticky and starting to rise potentially?
Are we kind of heading back for the second rise of the roller coaster?
In my opinion, absolutely not.
One third of the CPI numbers from shelter.
Shelter is a combination of rents, primarily rents, and owner's equivalent rents, which
is an imputed number by the BLS.
These all come off of surveys of rent prices.
Now we know by looking at Zillow and Redfin and other rental type, real-time, market-oriented
data that rent prices are somewhere between slightly up to most likely down.
We also know that the BLS puts out a number every six months.
It's called the new tenant rent index.
So that just looks at new tenants, new lease signings, not people that have already been
in a place for a while.
Those are down almost 4%.
So let's just assume that shelter prices are flat.
Well, if we exclude shelter from CPI, the CPI number was about 1.5%.
So CPI without shelter is already below the Fed's target.
If CPI was at 1.5%, the Fed would be concerned that inflation was too low.
The Fed would have cut rates significantly already.
So what's going on with shelter?
Why is shelter in the CPI equation?
It's such a big weight, but why is it so much higher?
It was up 0.6% for the month.
That's 7.2% roughly on an annualized basis, when everything else is telling you that rents
are basically flat, give or take a little, and probably below zero, but let's just say
flat.
So first of all, the price of anything else, oil, orange juice, go to the pump, you look
at the price, go to the grocery store, look at the price.
That's more or less the price they use.
They kind of survey what's going on in the market.
But with rents, they're calling people up and saying, "What's your rent and how did
that change?"
And your rent only changes once every 12 months.
Most rents are for one year.
So it's only going to change when your lease comes up for renewal.
So first of all, it's a lagging number unto itself because 1/12 of the respondents aren't
giving you real-time market data.
They're telling you how the lease changed anywhere up to a year ago.
Here's the other flaw.
They only call you twice a year.
They call you every six months, the people that they survey.
So let's say I'm on their survey and they called me and what are we in, we're in February.
So in January, they call me, "Hey Mike, did your lease change?"
I go, "No."
February comes and my lease comes up for adjustment and I make a deal with where I'm renting from.
And we say, "We're going to drop it just 10 bucks a month."
Great.
Well, the BLS isn't going to call me again for another five months to know that my rent
price declined or changed, whatever happened.
So not only do you have a lag because you're almost looking at a year over year number
the way they do it versus everything else that is more or less real-time, not real-time,
but very close to a month or two of current.
And then you got this survey problem.
Then on top of it, they impute this owner's equivalent rent, which doesn't make any sense
because even rent and CPI fell, but owner's equivalent rent popped higher.
The two of them tend to stay very close to each other.
So bottom line is I think this CPI number was a fluke.
There are other issues to take with it.
A lot of insurance and medical costs went up in January.
January is when those costs reset.
So they were a little higher than expected, but that's kind of more of a one-off type
increase in prices.
So I think as we're going to see over the next few months, it doesn't mean it's going
to be in the next set of data or even a month after that, but we're going to see inflation
continuing to trend lower.
And just as we saw it pop this month, next month we could see a number, not well below,
but decently below estimates.
And it's just a flaw in the way the BLS calculates data.
Okay, I just want to interject because folks have made comments frequently in the past
that like, yeah, the BLS data is just garbage and the government always underreports inflation
anyways and it's in its interest to do that.
I just want to let folks know, I have had a lot of requests to interview the team at
Trueflation, which is a relatively new service that's come on to create what they consider
to be a much more accurate sense of the price inflation that real people are experiencing.
I'll be interviewing them by the end of this month, so just know that that interview is
coming up relatively soon.
So sorry for interrupting, Mike.
I just wanted folks to know that, but take it from here and clearly, let's get to the
question of, so do you see us as not having a seventies style rise and fall?
And if so, why?
But real quick, if I can go back to Trueflation, because I've been following that over the
last month or two and I've kind of read some of their information on how they do it.
They're using real prices that they get from a number of sources.
They don't get into hedonics.
They don't data smooth.
So it's in my opinion, and again, I don't know their calculations.
I don't know what they're doing behind the scenes, but it appears to be a better gauge
of real time inflation.
Now as of, I think it was either this morning or yesterday morning, inflation was, according
to Trueflation, 1.39%.
What did I say CPI excluding shelter was?
It's actually 1.4%.
So it turns out that the BLS number and Trueflation are potentially very much in line if you just
strip out the shelter nonsense.
So now the question is, and there was this pretty bad graph from Apollo going around
that showed that the inflation of the last 10 years and the inflation from the late 1960s
through early 1980s are on almost the identical path.
And that one graph, one stupid graph prompted me to write four long articles on the '70s
and today and why they're different.
If you've seen the graph, first of all, it's a very flawed graph.
It starts in 1968, I believe, and it charts inflation through 1982 or '83.
And it compares it to the current timeframe, but the current timeframe on their graph starts
in 2014.
Our inflationary impulse didn't really kick off till 2020, 2021.
So they don't line up that well.
And if you also notice that the Y-axis for 1970s inflation is on a different axis than
the current.
So when you kind of readjust the graphs, there you go.
And when you readjust the graphs, they don't really look nearly like they do.
And in my article, I actually kind of recreate their graph to show what it would really look
like if you keep them on the same Y-axis and you set the dates appropriately.
But let's just go back to the '70s for a little bit.
The '70s inflation, and we'll call it '70s, but it's really later '60s through early '80s
with self-inflicted wounds one after another.
The Fed, the government, and then a couple of exogenous events.
So back in the '70s and late '60s, remember you're not that far removed from the Great
Depression.
So back in that time, unemployment was evil.
No one wanted unemployment and they were willing to sacrifice higher inflation for low unemployment.
So the Fed really focused on unemployment and didn't think about inflation.
They were fine with inflation going up.
But what they didn't factor in is that consumers and corporations would change their behaviors.
They didn't think this could happen.
That a consumer would say, "Well, the price of a refrigerator is going to be 1,000 bucks
next month, but it's only 900 this month.
I'm going to buy it today instead of tomorrow."
So you create some artificial demand.
You pull purchases forward, which kind of fueled inflation.
There was a price wage spirals, which they also didn't really think would happen.
That consumers would see inflation, they'd ask their boss for more money, and the boss
would give them more money, then the boss would raise the prices on goods, and you kind
of get this circular effect.
And unions were much stronger back then.
They were 20% of employees were in a union.
Today it's less than 10%.
So the unions had more members, but also they were stronger, and so they could push some
of these wage pressures through into inflation.
President Nixon tried to put a cap on price changes.
So what happened?
Companies stopped producing.
They're like, "I can't do this profitably anymore."
So they artificially cut supply because they weren't allowed to raise their prices.
Lincoln took us off the gold standard.
That allowed the Fed to do whatever they want.
That allowed the government to run any kind of deficit without any kind of checks and
balances.
That's a big deal.
That happened in 1971.
You had the oil embargo, oil shocks.
Well, today we basically were, 100% of our oil can come from the United States.
It doesn't, but it can.
Back then it was less than 50%.
So we're not dependent on the Middle East anymore for oil or for anyone else for that
matter.
The Federal Reserve never took their foot off the money supply.
The money supply increased throughout.
It went up and down like a roller coaster, but it never really got below the money supply
growth, never got below 5% even during the high inflationary times.
That's insane.
That's because the Fed was solely focused on Fed funds and they didn't truly appreciate
that money supply is really what matters.
It was Paul Volcker that said, "Hey, we're doing this wrong.
Money supply matters and we're going to get that under control."
That's ultimately what got inflation to calm down in the very early '80s, late '70s.
So fast forward 50 years.
We have a pandemic.
Well, what do we do?
We shut down production of everything.
Our transportation lines get crippled and then we just rain money on people and on the
economy.
So what do you do?
You artificially boost demand and at the same time you kill supply.
That's economics 101.
First day of economics, that's what they teach you that increased demand, less supply is
higher prices.
That's what happened.
So what's happening now?
Supply lines are largely fixed.
There are still shortages.
They still can't make enough chips for cars, but by and large, if you want to buy something,
it's available.
You can get it.
You don't have to wait six months for something.
Transportation is working just fine.
So the whole supply line is 99% healed.
There's still stimulus flowing through the economy, some behavioral changes because of
COVID and the way people are spending money and reacting and had saved money, but that's
largely coming to an end too.
So when I kind of think about our current bout of inflation, I think it was caused by
one thing, by COVID and the reaction, and it was global.
It wasn't just a United States thing.
This happened around the world, which just made it that much worse.
So I don't think that inflation is coming back.
I see that the trends of the prior 30 years where you had slower economic growth, weakening
productivity growth, weakening demographics, and just too much debt, a debt burden that
weighs on the economy is going to slowly re-influence itself and push all those trends lower.
And with it, inflation will follow, will go back towards disinflationary to the point
where the Fed's worried that inflation's only 1% or half a percent and we got to do something.
We got to boost it up.
We got to be at 2%.
And so, again, the '70s was a bunch of events, mainly self-inflicted by the government, by
the Federal Reserve.
And this is also to some degree self-inflicted, the COVID's not self-inflicted, but our response
was very self-inflicted, but it's over.
It was a one-time thing.
Not to say we can't have another event, be it a war, be it another virus, be it probably
something we can't even think of, aliens landing, who knows what.
That can happen and that can change our inflation outlook.
But we think that the trends of the last 30 years are still very much intact.
And if anything's strengthened by all the unproductive debt we have produced over the
last few years, we'll only weigh on growth further.
So once we get out of this, what are we now, four years into this kind of COVID craziness
as far as economics goes, those trends, those longer-term trends will keep reasserting themselves
stronger and stronger, bringing inflation lower.
So let me ask you a related question on that.
So first off, thank you for that very detailed answer and clarifying that from your perspective,
at least as you're looking, I'm going to say for the next year or so, you expect disinflation
to continue being the trend.
So we've got very smart people like the Lacy Huns of the world who are saying, look, deflation
was always the much bigger dragon and yeah, we had to maybe stop fighting it for a minute
to deal with this inflation dragon that showed up because he was creating too much carnage
in the short term.
But when you look at the real-term battles we're going to be facing, it's his bigger
deflationary brother that we have to really be focused on.
Then there are all the lag effects that you and I have talked about, which should at some
point manifest themselves in slowing economic growth in the relatively here and now over
the course of this year and next.
So the thing that's standing in the way of that has largely been this net rise in liquidity
from a lot of different sources, but certainly a big one has been the extraordinary deficit
spending that the government has been doling out.
So I've asked this question once or twice, I think I even asked it if your partner Lance
Roberts there.
Now that extraordinary deficit spending has kind of become business as usual, right?
It's no longer, "Oh, we have some massive crisis and we're going to do this for a short
period of time."
It's now just sort of like dialing the deficits up to 11, cranking it up to 11.
It's just kind of how we do things now.
Obviously, the longer you do that for, you can create inflation, right?
Because fiscal stimulus tends to be more inflationary than monetary stimulus because it finds its
way directly into the economy.
But my question is, even if you're worried about that, which doesn't sound like you are
that much in the near term, but I don't want to put words in your mouth, is there a politician
today on the scene who would have the political appetite to say, "It's time to dial it back."
Are we now stuck with this, with the accelerator fully to the floor now?
You know the answer to this question.
I just want to make sure that everybody does, right?
I mean, look, there may be a politician that thinks that, but if they think they're going
to get reelected on that kind of platform, they can forget it.
The answer is no.
Right.
So just to be super clear, my question is we cranked it up to 11, we used COVID as the
reason for it, and then the reason has morphed into just because, it's just what we need
to keep it going.
So it's never going to come off of 11 willingly.
It'll waver, right?
It'll waver based on which politicians and how much of an appetite there is to get the
deficit down.
But I think, look, the deficit path has been, it's been on the same path now for 30 years.
We're spending, our debt to GDP continually rises and there was a big jump in the debt
to GDP, but it actually came off and now it's kind of going back onto that more trend growth,
which isn't good, but it's not going to the moon anymore.
So you know what, I think this, it is what it is.
We can look at Japan now, their debt to GDP is twice ours and they have a deflation problem.
Deflation, not disinflation, deflation problem.
So the thing you got to think about, and Lacy Hunt says this, that government debt has the
negative multiplier.
That means it's unproductive debt that the benefit you get from that debt, there is a
benefit initially the money gets spent and boost the economy, ultimately hampers economic
activity more than it helps it.
So that hampering part from 2021, 22, 23, that's in our future.
There's more of a headwind from that old debt that's coming down the pike.
So can the government continue to just boost fiscal spending more and more?
Maybe, but they're not going to be able to do it at four or 5% interest rates.
They're going to need the Fed to help them out.
They're going to need much lower interest rates to keep the Ponzi scheme going, just
like in Japan.
Which I was going to say, so you're basically saying we should expect the Japan playbook
from here.
I just want to reiterate another conclusion that a number of recent guests have made,
which is when you have that playbook, there's no free lunch.
You can't get away with it.
You have to pay the price somehow.
And Japan is paying it to a fair amount of extent in slower economic growth than it would
like.
But the real victim, like the real pressure relief valve here of this, is the currency.
The value of the yen has just gotten crushed over the past couple of decades.
And don't let me put words in your mouth, but I presume you think, same thing with the
US dollar.
From a purchasing power standpoint, yep, it might still hold up well versus the other
fiat currencies, but from a purchasing power standpoint, that's what gets sacrificed with
that playbook.
Yeah, but that's been going on for 50 years now.
Again, that trend is intact.
Yes, the purchasing power will get smashed.
Okay, I hear you're saying like, "Hey, tell me something that's new," but is it that it's
sort of asymptotic, which is that the loss of purchasing power accelerates as you pursue
the playbook?
Possibly, yeah.
I mean, I guess so.
I'll say yes, but that's the playbook.
And you can't, I can't, they say, "Mike, you're now the Fed governor.
What are you going to do?"
The answer is you keep rates higher for longer.
You put this economy into a recession.
You try to flush out the unproductive debt.
You let the bad banks go bankrupt.
You let the zombie companies go under and you clean yourself up.
That was a mistake Japan made in 1990.
They didn't let the banks go under.
They didn't clean up the bad debt.
They just kept everything in a zombie state.
And here they are 30 years later with the same GDP they had in 1990.
So are you going to elect me Fed governor if you're in Congress if I tell you that's
my plan?
Absolutely not.
No.
I'm going to vote for you, but my vote doesn't matter.
Well, you will.
I'll get one vote.
I'll get one vote.
And maybe Lance will vote for me if he's in a good mood that day.
Well, the reason why I really wanted to just hammer on this is because at the end of the
day, we've got regular people watching this channel, right?
And so I just want them to be clear about where our experts like you see the puck headed.
And if you see it towards a furthering destruction of purchasing power possibly accelerating
over the years, decades, then the question to ask now is what steps can I take today
to at least preserve as much of the purchasing power of my wealth as possible?
All right.
Well, look, Mike, there's so many other questions I want to ask you, but we're running out of
time here.
I did say we'd briefly touch on bonds.
So generally, interest rates are a function of where inflation expectations are headed.
And if you think inflation is coming down, then is it correct to assume that you think
that interest rates will continue to come down and that's still an important part of
why you guys are continuing to hold bonds?
Yeah, absolutely.
Bonds are primarily a function of inflation and inflation expectations.
And again, kind of like I laid out earlier, I think inflation is coming down over the
longer run.
There are potential things that could happen that could boost it up, right?
If we get in a recession and that 2020, 2021 playbook comes out where the Fed prints a
ton of money and the government lets it rain money, then yeah, we could have another bout
of inflation.
But I think the longer term kind of really crappy macro trends are in place and that
will bring inflation lower.
So do you see bonds continuing to do well this
year?
I mean, presumably you bought kind of big into them last year, early this year.
Do you expect that trade or that positioning to pay off this year?
Yeah.
And look, if bonds go nowhere from here, you're still making four or 5%.
But yes, I think bonds will continue lower.
And if we do get a recession, they'll go much lower and much quicker.
But assuming that we kind of stay in this Goldilocks scenario and inflation continues
to trickle lower, I think bonds will kind of go lower with it.
Okay.
A natural question that I want to ask as a follow up is, so what are your thoughts on
duration and going further out on the yield curve to capture some of the big gains that
you think could be realized if rates really come down?
But we're going to save that, folks, for the conference.
So one last question before we get to your market outlook, and then we'll wrap it up.
On the day you and I were talking, the video that launched on Thoughtful Money was one
I did with Chris Hamilton of Economica.
And he produces a ton of charts, just these fantastic chartists.
And one of the things that he spends a lot of time focused on with his charts is demographics
in the US.
And I'll admit, I didn't realize it was this bad.
The birth rate in the US and obviously in a lot of other Western countries has been
decreasing quickly.
In fact, the number of births in the US has decreased by 20% since 2013, if I'm remembering
that correctly.
So very short period of time, I just did 10 years and we've locked 20% of our birth rate
out.
That's like a million births, I think, if I'm remembering correctly, per year.
And this is factoring in all births.
So citizens, immigrants, illegal immigrants, these are just reported births in hospitals.
And you compare that with the death projections in this country.
And again, these aren't really so much like government massage numbers.
These are just the hospitals basically looking at what they're dealing with and reporting
it.
The crossover point from where the population starts shrinking is only about a decade away.
It's around 2035 at current trends.
And historically, he's using the lowest, the most conservative numbers, like the worst
birth numbers and historically over the past couple decades, the projections have always
still proven too high.
So we may hit that number even before then.
So that has massive implications in a whole bunch of different areas, but certainly in
the economy, and not just as the overall population going to start shrinking unless something
really major changes.
But the big dominant trend is like what we've seen in countries like Japan, again, where
the mix of the population is getting increasingly older.
So the key part of what drives the economy are productive workers in the 25 to 54 age
cohort.
And on a percentage basis, that number's going down, and I believe even we may be at the
point where on an absolute basis, that number is going down.
So what we've been doing as a country over the past couple of decades has been basically
swapping human-driven production with debt.
And debt, as you know, pulls tomorrow's prosperity into today.
So you can only get away with that for so long.
So giving you all this backstory to say, putting on your long-term hat here, what does that
mean for things like the bond market when you have a country that just cannot grow its
economy further because it's just not growing?
It's not only its overall population, but its productive population.
It means if you want to keep everything going, you've got to get yields to zero.
At a yield of zero, me or you, Adam, could borrow a trillion dollars and have no problem
paying it back, right?
So the answer is the answer that they've been doing.
It's lower and lower interest rates.
And you may laugh at zero, but Japan's had negative interest rates for the better part
of the last five years, maybe even longer than that.
That's the answer because we're not getting any growth.
Like you said, our demographics are deteriorating, productivity growth in this country, it's
still growing, but that rate of growth is deteriorating.
So the only way to supplement both of those negatives is with credit growth.
And if that credit growth isn't productive, then you're forced, the only way to keep credit
growth growing is with lower interest rates.
Is to give it no cost.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Okay.
So to the person who hears this and sort of cavalierly says, "Oh, well then why worry?
Japan's doing it.
We'll do it."
Right?
What would your answer be?
It comes at the cost of prosperity for the people.
And at the end of the day, that's what it is.
You're not advancing capitalism anymore.
It becomes more and more, I'm not going to say socialist, but a bought system, a manipulated-
Well, a state controlled system, right?
Doesn't Japan basically own all the bonds in Japan now?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look, I mean, Lance and I talk about all this all the time.
Why do we spend so much time talking about the Fed?
Because the Fed manages liquidity.
They manage interest rates to some degree.
The more debt you have, the more you care about liquidity and interest rates.
So we become even more controlled by the Fed, by what the Fed wants.
And that's a function of the debt, debt rising much quicker than GDP.
So we're moving away from capitalism to what?
Socialism, I guess you could call it, but we're moving away from capitalism and all
the benefits to the prosperity of the people that come with capitalism.
That's the cost.
That's a painful cost, especially I think when you go back and look over 30 years, the
differences that will occur and have occurred.
So this is definitely starting to sound like one of the rant sessions that Lance and I
have every Saturday and this super important topic, I would love to really dive deeply
into it with you, Michael, and I'd love to ask you the question that I ask Lance when
we do this, which is, hey, if you were in charge, what reforms would you like to see?
But we're going to save that for one of your next appearances on here where you have time
to do the topic real justice.
So I got to wrap it up here, but I want to give just a minute for you to share how your
portfolio manager there at Real Investment Advice, how are you guys positioned right
now for the year you see ahead?
So right now we are long bonds.
We have higher duration bonds, and we are pretty much at our model on inequity weights.
Regardless of what we think, we have to play what the market is doing right now.
And there are seven stocks.
Well, now it's down to like five stocks that are driving the market.
And there are other opportunities, but we're cautious.
We are concerned that the market got over its skis a little bit here, that we're due
for correction at some point.
We understand there's going to be a lot of volatility coming.
So we have our radar up.
We're prepared to, we slightly reduced exposure a couple of days ago.
I'm sure we'll do it again in the coming days or weeks.
But again, it's listen to the Fed, what's the Fed telling you?
And unfortunately it's become more about the Fed, less about fundamentals and valuations
and all the stuff that we were taught in school.
So it's going to be another tricky year, probably a volatile year, especially as we get closer
to the election.
Okay.
Well, Michael, like I said, for folks that want to hear more from you, we're going to
go real deep into bonds and your bonds outlook and how exactly you're planning to play things
at the conference.
But again, I'd like to have you back on within a couple of months here on the public channel
as well to dive into a lot more of the, what I think are sort of the more meaningful longer
term issues.
So anyways, Mike, thanks so much for coming on here.
For folks that want to follow you in your work, tell them where they can go.
Realinvestmentadvice.com, everything both Lance and myself do is there.
We also write a daily commentary.
So if you don't like our long articles that put you to sleep, we put out a daily commentary,
which you can subscribe for free, it'll go to your email.
And it's, you know, three or four short stories with a brief market update that kind of tell
you what's going on in the world and help give you our take on whatever matters that
day.
Great.
And you're on Twitter too, as well, right?
@Michael Lebowitz.
All right, great.
And Michael, when I edit this, I'll put up the links to those on the screen so folks
know exactly where to go.
Folks, I'll put links in the description below the video too, if you just want to one click
access to those.
Michael, my friend, it's always great.
Thanks so much for coming on.
Yep.
All right.
Well, now's the time of the program where we bring in the lead partners from New Harbor
Financial, one of the financial advisory firms endorsed by Thoughtful Money.
I'm joined as usual by lead partners Mike Preston and John Lodra.
John, why don't we start with you?
I'm going to guess that you're like minded with a lot of what Mike Lebowitz had to say
there, but what do you think?
Yeah.
Hey, Adam.
Thanks.
Great to be with you again.
And we have a lot of similar takes on some things with Michael, kind of kindred spirits
with him in the sense that we and their firm are your two thoughtful monies, two endorsed
financial advisors as folks that might go to seek the consultation with either one of
us would see.
That is true.
Sorry to interrupt.
Yes, you are the two in the US.
I just went for Canadians watching.
We do have a firm in Canada, Rocklink Investments, that's run by John Wellum.
So we do have that third in there, but yes, you're the two big guys in the US.
Absolutely.
And we can't work in the Canadian markets at Norcan RIA.
And we had an opportunity to have some quick pleasantries offline with Michael before we
came on here.
So hello again, Michael, and we look forward to resuming the live Q&A's, Adam.
We really enjoy those and lively debates and discussions we can have amongst us to illuminate
for your viewers.
Thank you.
And again, for newer viewers that aren't familiar with this, in the past, I've held monthly
or quarterly Ask Anything Q&A's on this channel with all of those advisory partners that we
just listed, the guys at New Harbor here, Mike and Lance from RIA, and then Jonathan's
firm from Canada, where for an hour, they're here and we're just answering your questions
live.
It's not for me to prepare a script and guide a discussion.
It's just for whatever topics you guys want answers to and the questions can be extremely
personal.
If you have big questions that they can say, "Hey, I'm wrestling with this specific investment
decision.
What do you guys think?"
So yes, John, we will be picking those back up again soon and that's been on me.
So I will make that happen again soon.
Yeah.
So I don't want to repeat everything Michael said.
So there are a lot of things that I think we and he aligned with on some of the takes.
There are some areas, of course, we have some different nuanced takes and I'll try to point
out a couple of those things, but big picture, the economic prognostication that we all need
to kind of go through to try and make sense of the world.
We'll be the first as money managers to admit it's important to try to get a grasp on this,
but like valuations, economic cycles are not very good timing indicators.
In fact, markets, if you look over history, look at a graph of the S&P 500 and overlay
recessions and there is no forward-looking aspect to markets when it comes to recessions.
They peak right before recessions are declared, right?
But it's important just like valuations, economic data and cycles are important to set the tone
of the offensive plays we might run so that when valuations are high and economic cycles
are looking pretty tenuous, we're going to use our hedging tools.
We're going to have some safety belts in place even if we're still like our technical indicators
might suggest, hey, to be invested decently in equities despite these backdrops.
So I don't want to get into too much there, but certainly we have an eye on the economic
cycles.
A few areas I just want to quickly touch upon here, one and Michael touched upon this is
really the standoff that the markets and the Fed have had over the last several months
and so far as what likely short-term interest rate policies might be in the coming year.
I'll touch upon that in a second.
And then just this idea that interest rates are too high, too high for the environment
we're in, right?
So I'll touch upon that.
And then I'll touch upon a little bit of what the data tells us about some of the misconceptions
that people oftentimes have as relates to recessions and inflation, deflation and interest
rates.
So I'll touch upon those, but let me just, I want to share, we have a YouTube page here
at New Harbor where we speak to our clients directly on a weekly basis and we touch upon
some things that we can get into deeper color on than we can here oftentimes with you, Adam.
So I just want to share a view of that page because there's a couple areas that I want
to highlight here.
Can you see that page here?
So our YouTube channel is fairly new, but it's at New Harbor Financial at YouTube, but
a couple of ones that I've done recently and you can see Mike and I are prominently plastered
on this page.
We do pretty much alternating weeks.
I talked specifically about the interest rate expectations, say this one here, the deconstructing
the Goldilocks narrative and this one here more recently, resetting the rate expectations.
So folks can maybe look at that if they're interested to kind of get our in-depth take
on that.
And Mike's done some really interesting ones like calling out the S&P 500 milestone last
week, but I'm going to stop sharing right now, but just to put some flavor on how dramatically.
So if you go back to the market's bottom last year, October 27th of 2023 was the bottom
in the S&P and I think the bond market even bottom that day.
And the next couple of months through a few months through the end of the year, the next
couple of months was rocket higher in stock markets and bond markets.
One of the main reasons is there was a complete sea change in terms of the market's view on
Fed rate policy into 2024.
And we think the market got way ahead of itself just to put it and the market's now realizing
that.
Just to put some numbers behind that, at the end of December and then last year, the market
was pricing in an 88% probability of a Fed cut by this upcoming March Fed meeting.
That probability is now down to 10%.
So the market went from 88% likelihood of a Fed cut in the March meeting to 10% now.
Pretty abrupt change.
And then if you look at where at the end of December they were pricing in bright cut odds
for the May meeting, this coming May, 100% probability the market was pricing in.
Now it's about 42%.
So there's been a dramatic reassessment by the market, maybe getting more real perhaps,
and the Fed has done a decent job talking that back because I think they're deathly
afraid of what the market was pricing into their messaging.
But that's been a dramatic change.
So that's obviously bears watching.
That will have ramifications as I think will still play out in markets.
Bonds have sold off recently, I think in line with that repricing.
I want to speak to the idea that rates are too high.
I think a big part of this is setting the anchoring or the recency bias of where rates
have been for the last decade or more in the face of these very extreme monetary policies.
So I'm going to turn to some great charts.
We oftentimes will quote John Hussman and bring some of his work, but he's done some
phenomenal work on exactly this topic.
So I want to pull up a couple of cards of his if I could.
So this is a chart that basically shows the federal funds rate in dark blue.
And you can see for much of the last decade is pinned at zero.
There was a hiking campaign here that had to get reversed really quickly in the face
of COVID.
And then of course, this hiking campaign.
So we're, you know, target rate is five and a quarter to 5.5% right now, relative to economic
and Michael, rightly, Michael Leibovitz rightly points out that this should be an inflation
and things like that should be driven by employment, output, inflation, things like that.
If you look at the composite of those metrics and the Fed's own Taylor rule, which they
frankly had thrown by the wayside, you know, rates are not high compared to the current
set of factors that we have.
And that's short term rates.
If we look longer term, and this gets into some of the misconceptions, you know, people
think recessions automatically mean inflation, you know, turns around, we get price or disinflation
or even even deflation.
When in fact, if you look at every recession going back to the fifties, with the exception
of this one, which is the Volcker, you know, coming to the rescue in 87, looking out months
from the start of the recession, this looks at two years from the start of recession,
24 months, almost in every case that PCA PCE inflation measure, which is the one that matters
because that's the one the Fed watches and bases their policy on, has been more or less
sticky.
And in fact, in many times declining.
So this idea that recession means declining inflation, there is probably anchored in this
one outlier here in the late 80s, and I mean, their late 70s, early 80s, and Michael talked
about the differences between now and then.
And then this is sorry, john, sorry to interject, but just going back to that for one sec.
So if in if recession doesn't necessarily mean deflation or sharp disinflation, does
it mean stagflation?
Does it very well remains high, but but but economic growth suffers, it very well could
be and that's where I think some of the themes of the 70s while I agree that chart that Michael
showed was an example of what we call chart crime, you know, kind of overlaying different,
you know, there's enough things that could kind of speak to similarities that I think
we're not so sangreen about dispelling that idea that that inflation will be sticky.
You know, I'm gonna I'm not gonna hold off on those other charts.
But the other charts, the bottom line is that right now we're a 10 year Treasury bond yield
is getting close to where we think is is a more viable level.
Right now the 10 year yield is at four 4.25 today as we speak, we think certainly in about
four and a half range, maybe a little little before then, we'd be looking to add to some
of our longer term bond exposure, but we were definitely underweight longer term bonds,
we sold in recent strength, and they've pulled back and we're glad we did.
But there'll be a time to add add more longer term bonds.
But right now, especially with the resetting of odds of short term interest rates, we think
holding, holding short term, shorter term Treasury is still a very good place to be.
So I'll pause right there.
I'm sure we have plenty more to talk about.
Okay, well, Mike, why don't I hand the baton over to you?
Anything else you want to add to what with john said there, you know, regarding the discussion
with with Mike Leibovitz.
So Michael talks about inflation coming down, his expectation is that there's downward pressure
on inflation, we've got to agree with him.
It's kind of an anomaly post COVID, there was $7 trillion thrown into our economy.
And you know, that caused the biggest, I think, rapid spike in inflation that I've seen in
my lifetime.
Right.
And when started, sorry to interrupt, but it also had, you know, just massive supply
shock, right.
So you know, it really was two, two incredibly rare phenomena happening at the exact same
time, both of which were very inflationary.
Absolutely, seven trillion, you know, inflation, and you're just that it's more than it costs
us to win World War Two more than all that was invested in World War Two.
And that caused the whole pig through the Python thing that you often talk about, Adam,
you know, you lock people in their homes and tell them they can't go out and, you know,
they spend money on Amazon or, you know, whatever they do online shopping all day.
And so that caused a ridiculous amount of inflation.
And we saw a blow off top in equities and a blow off top in housing prices in 2021.
You know, I thought the top of the market was seen on January 4th, 2022, but the market
has had different ideas after declining 20% in 2023, here we are again with another blow
off top.
And as we speak, the S&P is at 5026, but getting back to inflation, I think Michael is right.
There's some problems with macro.
He talks about, I think he said that Japan and Germany and the United Kingdom are already
in inflation based on some readings this morning.
You wouldn't know it by looking at the stock charts because the stock charts look very
good.
And that's another lesson that the stock market doesn't always equal economic data.
And in fact, oftentimes when recession is confirmed, the market has already bottomed
and based on the charts of Japan, for instance, which we have a position in, it looks like
it might be the case there.
But inflation went to 9%.
And everyone thought, oh my God, inflation is here.
You know, the cat's out of the bag.
I've got to, you know, I've got to buy inflation bonds.
And there was kind of a small window there where you could buy I bonds at 9.5%.
I know that you were talking about that, Adam.
And that was good advice because you had six months to get a really high interest rate
and the next six months went down to six and change.
Now they're back to three and change, something like that.
So that opportunity is over.
And the question is now what?
We talk to clients about their I bonds and they ask us if they should be buying TIPS,
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
And if you look at that market, it's showing like a two and change inflation expectation
over the next five, 10 and 30 years.
So if you think inflation is going to be higher than, let's say 2.4%, which is roughly where
it is now, maybe 2.2% is the expectation, you'd want to buy inflation bonds.
But honestly, I think that we might see deflation.
I think we see an asset price drop.
I think the Fed loses control.
I think we see a recession/depression and a stock market crash.
I believe that's going to be the case.
I think that we're going to run out of gas with the money printing.
And some of the data that Michael just talked about there supports that.
So if you think we're going to flirt with deflation or a big drop in the market, you
don't really want to buy inflation bonds.
You want to buy regular bonds.
And so we completely agree with Michael about being long bonds.
John just talked about the fact that the 10-year note is at around 4.2, I think, right now.
We would be layering into 10-year bonds or 20-year bonds between 4.2 and 4.5 on the 10-year.
That's what a normal retracement looks like to us on the charts from the high of 5% down
to 3.8.
In fact, I could share the chart.
I don't think I will at the moment.
I don't think it's worth the time.
But the 10-year yield is 4.2.
So we'd be adding to our position enough.
Frankly, I think the 10-year yield would go to 3% or below.
And so this whole game of chicken that the market has had with the Fed, the Fed has won
over and over and over again.
I have to say that right now.
They've won.
They've got their way.
They look like their geniuses.
But I think they'll probably lose control at some point.
They'll start dropping rates when asset prices drop.
I have no idea when that's going to happen because right now it looks like this market
wants to go on another spike higher, another blow off.
Nobody knows where it's going to end.
But I think we're probably within months of seeing it end.
And then I think that long bonds will go up in price and yields will go back down.
OK.
I got a lot of follow up questions to all that.
One, just to clarify for folks here, Mike, a lot of the folks that I talked to, experts
I talked to on this channel who sort of see the future trajectory that you've lined out
there, will say, yes, the market's got way ahead of itself.
And economically, lag effects, et cetera, may come in here and make for a rockier second
half of 2024.
But almost every one of those people believes that at some point when the pain gets big
enough that the central planners are going to step back in with another massive amount
of stimulus and juice everything back up again.
Do you feel similarly or do you have a different outlook on that?
Absolutely.
I know they will.
They have proven that that's the only thing that they will do.
It's amazing.
They've kind of created this monster of a system that's disconnected from reality.
Can you imagine if they started cutting rates right now with the S&P sitting at 5026?
They really are kind of stuck in a corner.
And no, I've got no doubt.
So they have a lot of ammo now to drop rates.
John showed a chart earlier where rates were dropped and then of course there was the whole
Powell pivot and he reversed.
But there's a lot of ammo and they're going to drop.
But I honestly believe that this time it's going to be a surprise.
I think they're going to drop rates and the market's going to crash anyway.
Or it could happen at the same time.
I can't prove that until it happens, but that will be a scary time.
Yeah.
Well, and that's sort of what history shows.
And while we're talking here, I'll try to see if I can't pull up the chart I've shared
many times before that maps recessions to the federal funds rate.
And you see the Fed hikes and then it says, okay, I think we're done.
It hangs out for a little bit.
And then it realizes, oh my gosh, we went way too high for too long.
And then it's chasing the economy and the markets downwards.
That's when the economy goes into recession.
And that's when the stock market generally takes a big correction and the Fed is just
desperately cutting, chasing it all the way down.
So if you're right, you've got history on your side.
All right.
So maybe John, I'll come to you with this question, but it builds off of what Mike was
talking about.
So again, as I mentioned to Mike Leibowitz, folks watching this channel are just regular
investors trying to figure out what's going to happen and how do they not get caught unawares
by what's going on.
So Mike just mentioned that the S&P is now firmly above 5000, 5026 I think you said Mike.
So are you guys, do you see this as a time to still dance while the music's playing?
I hate to use that comment because it had such disastrous effect for Chuck Prince who
uttered it, but keeping an eye to the door.
Or is this the time to say, look, we're in a blow off top.
Yeah, it could go higher from here, who knows how much higher, but this is the time to take
gains if you got them and batten down the hatches for the inevitable correction when
the market hits its unsustainable zenith and cools off.
Yeah, a great question.
And the way I would maybe politely rephrase that is to recast it as it doesn't need to
be a binary choice.
You can kind of have it both ways, not with perfect participation, and that speaks to
part of our key toolkit, and that is using hedging tools, right?
So if one is just either all in or out of the market, they've got to make a bet.
They got to bet that it's going the way they hope it will go, and if it doesn't, well,
guess what?
Too bad, right?
Right.
You bet on red and it came up black.
Yeah, exactly.
What our hedging tools to keep it real simple allows us to put safety nets or guardrails
so that the cost of being wrong is contained and it can be contained with very known and
specified limits, and there's probably no better way to illustrate that than to actually
pull up a chart of the S&P and give you a little bit of a chronology over the last handful
of months what we've done with some of our hedging tools.
So let me just do that while we're here together.
So hopefully you can see this chart.
Okay, this is a daily chart of the S&P 500.
This is the October 27th low from last year, and here we are today.
We had to pull back here recently with the hotter than expected inflation report, and
we've pretty much closed that gap entirely, but you'll see some dotted lines here.
Basically from end of July to October last year, we had a very weak spot in the market,
and we had equity exposure during that timeframe, but we had some hedges.
So for example, we had a put option on the S&P 500 right here at about 4,500.
That's this dotted line here that basically took the sting out of much of this decline
in the S&P 500, and then of course we bottomed here almost on a dime with that change in
interest rate outlook I spoke of earlier, and in this strength, we saw some technical
signals get triggered that made us less worried about downside.
So on October 3rd, which is right here I think, we basically took profits in these puts and
punched them down to 4,100, the equivalent of 4,100, and in so doing we booked some gains
on those hedges, but we still kept some disaster insurance in place down here at this swing
low.
Now further follow through to the upside, we added equity on some of these breakouts,
and in so doing, we actually moved these put options back up here to 4,500 again.
Think about the safety net kind of almost like a trailing stop as a way to kind of make
sure the fall, if it were to happen, wouldn't be too damaging or too far.
And then just in the last couple of days, frankly, in fact, the day before this sell
off here, we moved these put options up here to 4,700.
So right now on about 15% of our client portfolio, we have put options struck at about the equivalent
of 4,700, and that covers about a little over a third, almost a half of the equity exposure
we have.
The other equity holdings we have are largely hedged with some near or even in the money
call options.
So we're well protected right now, even though we're pretty decently, we're still underweight
equities because they're still getting over 5% for very safe liquid T-bills.
But the point is, when the market is telling us what it's telling us, you can play that
for that move because we are, at the end of the day, looking to make forward progress
in our client accounts.
But the key is without taking too much risk, and that's where the hedging comes in and
we can say with a straight face and with confidence that, hey, if things got really bad and really
suddenly, they couldn't get any worse than this for that piece that we've got hedged.
Great.
And we talk a lot on this channel about the importance of risk management, and as I've
said many, many times with you guys on this program in the past, you guys are real masters
at it.
And I appreciate you showing folks how you're using it there in real time right now.
And I just want to make sure folks realize that using the strategy like the guys at New
Harbor are using, the higher the run up in stocks get, as John just showed, they can
continue to keep raising their download protection threshold.
So again, if it ever does get triggered, yeah, they're going to lose something in the market
load correction, but they're going to be able to retain much more of the portfolio than
had they been not using these risk management metrics or measures like they are.
And if they have the ability to keep raising them, they get to keep sort of more and more
of the current gains, however high this thing ends up going.
All right, well, we're going to start winding it up here, guys.
Mike, I'll let you kind of have the last observation here.
Again, I just want to reiterate the practical nature of having you guys here on the program,
which is really to serve as a model for folks for how a good professional financial advisor
who understands all the macro issues that we talk about in this channel, how you guys
are making decisions often in real time about managing client capital.
And as I talk a lot about, I think most people should be working with a professional financial
advisor because most people don't have the bandwidth or the expertise or the desire to
do all this stuff on their own.
So I appreciate the role you're playing here, but you guys talk to people day in, day out,
not just your clients, but a lot of viewers of this channel who are filling out our form
and going over and having all those free consultations with you.
What are you seeing right now in the mindset of the average investor?
Are folks getting worried about how stretched the market's getting?
Is it the opposite?
Are they beginning to feel the pull of FOMO?
What are you seeing emotionally right now and what's the most common counsel you're
offering to folks?
Surprisingly, we're not seeing a lot of FOMO yet.
I'm not seeing it anyway.
What I am seeing is kind of an acceptance that this isn't real.
A lot of people, particularly our clients and the people that we talk to through connection
with you that aren't our clients, but just want to talk, most of them are not heavily
in this market.
So I don't really know what to make of it.
A couple of years ago, people were in the market and they were like, I think it can
keep going because of the COVID stimulus and everything.
And I was thinking, well, that's a dangerous game.
And it was because we had that pullback in '23, but now it's almost like it's been going
on so long.
Right.
'22.
Yes.
They're just, they've almost accepted, they said the heck with it.
But what they are frustrated about is the housing market.
I'll tell you, I've had a lot of conversations.
People were like, what the heck, you know, mortgages are up at seven or 8% and they can't
buy a house.
A number of people are locked out for one reason or another.
They may have sold a house and rented in anticipation of getting in.
But I was talking to one person yesterday and they said, I was going to have a house
built and it was at the beginning of COVID and it was going to, I think the price was
650 to build it.
No, I'm sorry.
It was 450, but now the price is 700 just a couple of years later.
And so now it's like, wow, we're going to have to see a collapse in construction prices
to get prices down.
And this particular person, this example, he said that the general contractor wanted
like 35 or 40% of the project just to oversee it.
So the labor costs are through the roof.
People are paying it.
Yes, I know that people are flushed with cash and you know, people are leaving California
and they're going to Tennessee and Florida and they're buying sight unseen.
But I don't think this is going to go on forever.
That's the frustration that I'm seeing.
Maybe like 10 conversations like that in the last month, people are frustrated about housing.
I don't think housing will crack until the stock market crashes or cracks at least.
And so that's the tedious thing for folks.
And for the most part, we tell them to be cautious and wait.
If they're selling a house in a bubble, well then I'd say go buy a house in a bubble.
Don't time that.
Probably not worth it.
But if they're already out and they've been out for a couple of years and they're renting,
just try to keep them patient.
But there's a lot of frustration related to that right now.
I can understand.
And I was just talking with one of the guests that many viewers on this channel know.
And this person was saying that they were putting their house up on the market right
now and they were, given the market dynamics, they were listing it for twice what they bought
it for, I think three years ago, which shows you how frustrated the average person is,
who are just like, "These prices just continue to get more and more insane."
One of the questions I ask a lot is, and I think I asked a variation of it to Mike Leibowitz,
is can the Fed ride to the rescue in time to save corporate America from the maturity
wall?
And I've not heard somebody definitively answer that yes.
I think most people have a pretty healthy skepticism of it that even if, like I said
earlier, even if the Fed brings the discount rate down to four and a half, that's still
way more than what these companies are paying on their existing debt that's on their books.
I think a lot of homeowners are crossing their fingers and just saying, "I just have to hang
out until the Fed brings rates down to getting mortgages, get back to where they were back
in 2019," when you and I could have had a pretty lengthy discussion about how the housing
market was overvalued back then, but now it looks quaint compared to today's numbers.
But I will put it out there and say, I have a really hard time seeing how the Fed can
ride to the housing markets rescue in time, given the corrosive effect that high mortgage
rates have right now, combined with today's prices, which are, as you said, Mike, are
the most unaffordable they've been in history, but they're just out of reach of such a huge
percentage of first time buyers.
Yes, there are people out there with deep pockets and can make all cash offers and whatnot,
but that is, I think it is a dwindling percentage of the populace.
And of course, this is a much more nuanced discussion.
There's a lot more of institutional money getting in there, whatever that's continuing
to contribute to this mess, and who knows if that's going to get cleaned up or not.
But at some point, housing is a function of what local incomes can afford, and just more
and more, they're just completely unattainable.
I just pulled this out recently that it says that in 99% of America, the average house
price is unaffordable to the average home buyer.
That's everywhere but 1%, right?
So anyways, John, I'll let you kind of back clean up here, in case you want to add anything
to what Mike said, but again, any parting counsel for the average person who's wrestling
with this current market environment?
Well, always bring it back to your own situation.
Bring it back to what you need to retire and live comfortably.
I'll say it again.
We say it all the time.
Our clients don't retire for one year or three months.
Don't make rash decisions upon short-term moves in the market.
Take a really big step back.
We're cognizant, and we're very much preaching caution still, even though we're invested
with belt and suspenders, because we are in the kind of environments that historically
have led to significant drawdowns that can absolutely devastate a firm financial footing.
The bigger sin is not missing out on some late-stage speculative rally.
It's an undoing or unwittingly undoing a really solid financial footing that no doubt for
our clients is the result of sacrifice, prudence, and discipline, and that's our primary job,
to help them keep that in focus and make sure they can live as securely as they possibly
can for years to come.
All right.
Well, very well said, John.
I think you guys did a really good job of the wisdom of why most folks should lean into
the expertise and support of a professional financial advisor like you guys.
So folks watching, unless you're super confident about navigating the uncertainty ahead on
your own as a DIY investor, highly recommend that you talk to your financial professional
advisor about all the issues that we've just talked about here, provided they're good and
that they actually take all these issues into account.
If you're having trouble finding a good one or would like a second opinion from one who
does take all this stuff into account the way we're talking about, maybe even John and
Mike and their team there at New Harbor, just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com, fill out the short
form there.
Have one of those free consultations.
They don't cost you anything.
There's no commitment to work with these guys.
It's just a free public service they offer.
But for all the reasons that Mike Liebowitz and I talked about, and then Mike and John
and I here have, don't put yourself at risk at being caught by surprise at what might
happen.
Make sure you've got a really good portfolio plan in place, ideally for the risk you're
taking with a lot of good risk management, like some of the strategies that John showed
earlier.
All right, folks, we'll look into wrapping up.
If you enjoyed having Mike Liebowitz on this program, would like to see him come back on
again in the near future, please let him know by hitting the like button, then clicking
on the red subscribe button below.
As well as that little bell icon right next to it.
And just a reminder that the Thoughtful Money Spring Conference is coming up now in just
a month.
Again, that's going to be Saturday, March 16th.
The faculty for that just keeps getting better and better.
And if you can't watch live, a reminder that replay videos of the entire event, all the
presentations and the live Q&A are going to be sent to everybody within 24 hours afterwards.
So even if you can't watch live, because you've got real life things to do, don't worry, you're
going to get those replay videos.
And a reminder too, I think we have it just for another week or two, but we've got that
lowest early bird price discount price out there.
So if you're thinking about going to the conference, make sure you act soon.
Lock it in now before it goes away.
And if you haven't heard me say this before, if you're a premium subscriber to our substack,
you get an additional $50 off that low early bird price discount, and it only costs $15
a month to subscribe to substack, so you spend $15 to save $50, you can pocket that $35 differential.
I'm happy if you want to game the system like that.
I want you to get the lowest price.
All right, Mike and John, guys, thanks so much for hanging with me for yet another week.
Look forward to having you back on next week, given whatever the markets do then, and you
can make sense of it for folks.
Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
So good to be here, Adam.
See you soon.
See you next week.
Goodbye for now, Adam.
Great to be here.
Have a great week.
Thank you.
Bye.
