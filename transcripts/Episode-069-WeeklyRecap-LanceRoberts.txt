Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm Thoughtful Money founder and your host, Adam Taggart, welcoming you back here at the end of another week,
featuring my good friend, abiding portfolio manager, Lance Roberts. Lance, any idea why I chose the word abiding?
Because I stick to the rules.
No, because you're on vacation, dude, and I just think of you like the Big Lebowski. You're just sitting there abiding, dude.
Yeah, this is true. This is true.
Although, you are disappointing. I was kind of expecting sort of a bit of a floral print shirt, maybe a fruity drink in hand with a little paper
umbrella in it, but you got your work get up on.
Yeah, unfortunately, I'm having to actually work a lot over the spring break, so markets don't sleep.
Yeah, as in no good vacation ever goes unpunished?
That's correct.
Alright, well, folks, a couple quick things before we dive into the weekly market recap. First, if you were watching this the morning
this video is releasing, Saturday morning, the 16th, Lance and I will actually be busy in parallel in a parallel universe running the
Thoughtful Money Spring Conference, and actually, if you want to still get in on it, you can turn this off, go jump into the conference,
watch the whole day, even if you're getting it through, you're jumping in half the day through, everybody who registers is going to get all the
replay videos anyways, so you're not going to miss anything. You're going to be sent the videos of the entire event.
So to go do that, if you're interested, just go to thoughtfulmoney.com/conference. If you're watching this after Saturday, don't worry, if you go to
that same URL, you can buy the replay videos of the entire event. And then after the event ends, I am going to follow Lance's lead and I'm going to be on
vacation for next week. There will be a couple of videos, we may have a day or two off from our normal relentless schedule. One thing I do want to
note, though, which is on Wednesday, this is a Fed release week. On Wednesday, there's going to be a press conference with Jerome Powell. I will hop
off the beach and get on with Axel Merck, and we're going to do a live reaction to whatever the Fed talks about the premium subscribers to our
sub stack, we're going to be able to watch and participate in that live and ask questions of Axel, everybody else will get a replay the next day.
Alright, well look, Lance, getting to the week, a bit of a flat week for the markets. They're pretty much looking like they're going to end up around where
they started. NASDAQ, maybe a little bit worse off for the wear. We'll pull up the charts, we'll get into what everything's telling us, but I want to ask you
this question to kind of look in the context of the recent market action, which is we've seen some more inflation data come in that show it's still
proven pretty sticky. Is that beginning to give the market pause here, where they might be thinking, "Look, Val may not ride to the rescue as fast
as we all thought."
Yeah, so a couple things. One, there's a lot of anomalies in the data that occur at the end of the year and at the beginning of the year, so November,
December, January, February, you get end of the year repricing for health insurance and a lot of things like that. So don't read too much into what's going on
with the inflation data over the last couple of weeks. Also, home prices, rental rates, all that is still working on a big lag. So that hasn't come through yet
either. So again, what's going on with inflation right now is nothing out of the ordinary. Again, we look at inflation on the every year basis. So we'll see
this start to tailor off as we get later into the year. So, no, I don't think it changes the Fed stance at all at this point. The only thing that's
happened is that the market's now realigned itself. It was expecting five to seven rate cuts this year. As of yesterday, it's now down to three, which is
exactly what the Fed is projecting for this year. The Fed's never put a timeline on those rate cuts. As we've said here, we expect them to be later this
year, could even be first part of next year. The one thing that may be out there that hangs the market up a bit is if the Fed potentially shifts its dot
plot a little bit higher, or if they start to talk about, "Yeah, well, we're going to keep watching the data right now. We're not to the point of
cutting." And maybe all of a sudden, we start talking about higher for longer in terms of the Fed rate hikes, and that we don't get a cut like I'm
predicting until next year.
Okay, yeah, and I just want to pull up this headline that I saw literally right before I hopped on with you here, Lance, but front page of Yahoo
Finance, it's time to stop waiting for the Fed. So it does seem that the narrative is beginning to cool off a little bit in terms of how quickly the Fed's
going to be riding to the rescue here, and we've talked a bit about this. It could be because of the sticky inflation that the Fed is saying, "Look,
we're going to wait and see a little bit longer." It could be because markets have risen so incredibly fast and financial conditions have really
loosened. It could be because unemployment is still under control. There's not a lot of traditional demands for cutting going on right now. In fact,
one could make the argument the Fed should need to be a little bit more worried about the economy overheating than having to ride to the rescue with
easing. Now, of course, what Powell and the Fed officials have been saying is, "Well, we don't want to wait until inflation's at 2% to start cutting
because then momentum will carry us too low," although to be honest, I don't know too many people that would cry about too low inflation for a while,
but whatever, the Fed's got its arbitrary 2% target there. So anyways, but it seems that once it starts creeping into the headlines of mainstream
outlets like Yahoo Finance, we're like, "You know what, maybe the Fed's not going to ride to the rescue as fast as we've been expecting." Theoretically,
that should get reflected somewhat in asset prices. Not saying that's the reason why things are flat this week, but it could be a contributor.
Well, first of all, look, the market's just gone very far very quickly this year. We haven't had any type of correction so far at all. Markets are very
overbought, very deviated from long-term trends. So again, just from a function of just buyers buying, there is a kind of a point where buyers
just kind of reached the point of exhaustion and we just have kind of been there for a while. You take a look at companies, we talk a lot about
Nvidia and AMD and these AI companies that have just surged straight up since November of last year. There's also a ton of other companies that if you
look at have gone just vertical in the last several months, companies that really make no sense, like Williams-Sonoma is up over 100% from its
2022 lows. You take a look at Wingstop as an example, you know, chicken wings, they trade at 30 times price to sell. I mean, it's just a bunch of
ridiculousness that's in there.
Carvana too, isn't that one of those stories?
Yeah, yeah. And so it's just, you know, it's just a lot of that kind of nonsense going on. We see a lot of mean trades are back as well. So, you know,
again, it's just a function, markets have gone very far. But you know, as I've said before, if I was a Federal Reserve, I'd be sending the message
right now that not only am I not going to cut rates, it may be a long time. Again, if I'm the Fed, I'm looking at the fact the economy is growing very
strongly, there's no sign of an economic slowdown from the economic data. Now, I'm not talking about real world stuff, I'm talking about the economic
headlines. According to economic headlines, you know, there's no economic slowdown going on, there's no threat of a recession. Take a look at the
inflation data, it's hanging in there. So you're not seeing inflation come down as sharply as you would expect during a recession. So the Fed's got 5.3%
interest rates, the mid rate out there is 5.25 to 5.3. And the economy is doing fine, you don't have any cracks in the financial system, credit
spreads are extremely low. So why cut rates? I'd be sitting on my hands going, I'm just gonna let y'all deal with it. And then at some point, I'll cut
rates if I need to. But right now, why waste the ammo I've got to offset a future recession? But again, you know, that's, that's me. But yeah, I'm
not. Let me ask you this question. So I've asked you this question before, and maybe it's just time to re ask it. Having talked with your
colleague there, at RIA, Michael Leibowitz, you know, he's sort of expressed the mindset of the Fed isn't, he doesn't think it's confidence that
it's going to achieve its mission that is driving the Fed to jawbone about rate cuts here. It's that the Fed actually is nervous about some things
that it's not telling us. And as we head here into Q2, you know, there are some things going on that could disrupt the steady rise in net liquidity in
the system. And maybe, maybe that's why Powell isn't delivering the Lance Roberts narrative here.
Right? Well, no, I mean, obviously, the Fed's worried about something, otherwise, you wouldn't be talking about cutting rates, right? So you know, is it
net liquidity? Maybe, I mean, net liquidity is rising, bank reserves are okay, they're actually going up since October of 2022. There's a
correlation between bank reserves and markets, which is why the market bottomed in October of 2022. So again, I know, there's a lot of headlines, a
lot of rhetoric out there that says, Oh, there's this potential for a crisis. Well, there's always a potential for a crisis, right? So we can
watch a nuclear bomb at some point. You know, what, you know, it's, it's, you know, the reality of what's going on, and the reality of what's
happening versus what expectations are. And again, I'm only talking about anecdotally, again, right, is just if you look at the economic data
headlines, doesn't seem to be anything wrong. You know, but maybe there is and yeah, Mike's right, maybe there's something the Fed's worried about or
should be worrying about that hasn't happened yet. Yeah, and look, I'm fresh off of recording, you know, a whole bunch of presentations for
tomorrow's conference. And a common theme is sort of, you know, we'll see what happens, what the implications are. But you've got the expiration of
the BTFP, which has been net liquidity supportive, you've got the reverse repo program that looks like it's going to get drained, which has been
net liquidity supportive. You've got tax season, which just pulls in a lot of capital that otherwise would go into the markets, all kind of
happening at the same period of time. Right now, is that what the Fed's worried about? I got no idea, to be honest, right? But I think these are some
of the things, not quite as remote as somebody detaining a nuclear bomb, hopefully. But you know, reasons to kind of be concerned, who knows, again,
whether that's driving PAL, certainly not driving the market, at least right yet. But let's just put our finger on inflation for just a little bit
longer. So we got the most recent PPI data this week, the producer price index, it jumped up to 0.6% year over year. That's double the Dow Jones
estimate. Or I guess it jumped, sorry, 0.6% on the month over month. But that was double the estimate that folks were expecting. Let's just say that
inflation does continue to be resistant to the Fed's efforts. And let's say it continues to creep up. And it should creep up, probably over the next
couple months, just from the base effect math alone. But let's say the data shows that it's just higher than folks were really expecting, including
the central planners. How does that change the game at all, market wise here? Would the markets have to force some sort of repricing? Or can they
just not care about it continually?
Yeah, I think the markets are starting to see through this stuff. I mean, even after the hotter than expected PPI report, the market held up just fine.
So, you know, you're not seeing any real implication, at least from the market action at this point, that they're showing a real concern, the
whole focus remains on the Fed cutting rates, right? So it's like, will the Fed cut rates? And the only thing again, that we've seen happening
from these inflation reports is just the market repricing from, oh, I'm going to get five to seven rate cuts to three. That's all that's
happened, the market keeps going up. So again, yeah, maybe, you know, there's there's some implications. But again, look, you have, like I said,
you've got a lot of seasonal effects that are going on, all this data is going to get revised in the future. So they're going to come back and
revise all this data lower in the next six to 12 months. So again, you know, what you're seeing now is a lot of estimates. Look, almost all of
the inflation push came from energy on the PPI side. So, you know, energy was up 4%. So again, you know, a lot of this will feed through and then
you're going to get the residual effects on the other side as energy prices come back down, rental prices are going to come down, home prices are
still falling. So, you know, those are also going to feed through into the measure of inflation. And as the economy does so the economy is
slowing down, by the way, you know, we went, we've gone from 9% to basically, you know, two and a half, 3% growth. So that is slowing down. And so as
economic growth slows down, so will inflation and that's just going to take time to get there. It's not going to happen overnight.
So let me ask you this then. So I had a really interesting conversation yesterday with Bill Fleckenstein, which is going to release the day after this
video releases. And, you know, Bill made a comment that I made a note I wanted to get your thoughts on where he said, there's been so much like
distortion in the market largely due to things like passive income flows, and just this tremendous amount of excess liquidity that's been sloshing
around, where he said the market has ceased becoming a leading indicator that gives us any good useful information. And it's really now just more of a
lagging indicator. So for example, like you were talking about the market having to continually reevaluate or, you know, change its expectations on
rate cuts, right, because of, you know, it was pricing seven earlier this year, now it's just pricing three. But that was the story for all of 2023.
They kept expecting a pivot, Powell kept saying no, and the market kept having to blink. And it didn't matter. Prices just still kept going up and up
and up. Like it didn't matter at all what the market's inflation expectations were, prices just kept rising. And could it be that there is just so much of
this ocean of liquidity sloshing around, that it kind of drowns out everything else. And, you know, at some point, the markets don't become a good
teller. People say, "Ah, you know, nothing you can think of isn't priced into the markets." And Bill was kind of saying, "It doesn't really matter at this
point. I don't think that's the case. I think all the markets really reacting to you are these big flows." Someday, probably when those flows start
receding, yes, all that will become true again. But it's not true now.
I don't know. Maybe. I mean, the flows that are certainly going on are certainly important to the market, right? I'm not denying that at all. And this whole
flow into ETFs, we've talked about the bifurcation of the market because of the ETF flows, etc. But let's go back in history. And let's just talk
about markets versus expectations for a moment. So in 2022, everybody thought we were going to have a recession. The market bottomed in October of
2022 and turned up. Everybody still thought we were going to have a recession. The market was saying no recession back in October of '22. All during
'23, everybody was expecting a recession, right? Market kept going up saying, "No, don't see a recession rising." Earnings started recovering. Economic
activity started improving. All through '23, kept getting stronger and stronger. And now finally in 2024, the market's now going, "Oh, yeah, well, yeah, we
just got the, just today, just this past week, S&P released their earnings for 2025, expecting the S&P earnings to grow to $251 a share. That's just a
massive jump from where we are now. So now the market and the analysts, everybody else is like, "Okay, well, yeah, now there's no recession. And so we
have to start ratcheting up earnings expectation, economic growth, no recession." So to say that the S&P wasn't a leading indicator is really kind of not a
true narrative, because the S&P has been saying for a year and a half, there's no recession.
Yeah. And look, they say traditionally bull markets love to climb a wall of worry. Everybody was certainly worried back in October of 2022. You could almost
make the argument that was the market saying there was going to be no recession or was just because liquidity flows switched, the liquidity flows just
powered everything, and that became the rationalization for it. I don't know. I just thought it was for a seasoned guy like him.
No, no, I'm just saying, look, the market's a leading indicator because of investors. The market's not a thing in and of itself. There's not a computer out
there called the market, and the computer's looking at all of this data going, "Okay, yeah, I don't think there's a recession, so I'm going to start
driving the index higher." No, it's the group of intelligence.
Right, it's a hive mind.
Right, it's a hive mind that drives the market. And while you and others were sitting around going, "Oh, recession, recession, recession," the hive mind
was saying, "No, no recession, you're wrong," and started running prices back up again and expectations of earnings growth and all this type of stuff.
And that's why we've been bullish for the last year and a half, right? The market was telling you that there was not going to be a recession
and why we started allocating assets to equities. I got a bunch of grief from your followers because of that. But that's what's been the nature of the
beast, and so the market leads the economy by about six months, and the economy's been getting stronger, not weaker. So I'm not sure where you can say
it's not a leading indicator because it's absolutely leading the way.
Okay, well, I'll let folks watch the session with Bill and then maybe we can revisit it afterwards once everybody kind of hears both sides. I just find it
interesting that a guy that clearly has been a long term season market participant, not unlike you, Lance, said a headless impression. And of course,
differences of opinion are what make a market, right? All right, look, let me put it this way. I've got some evidence here that we may be seeing the lag
effect beginning to become more visible in the real world around us. I know you've also got some pieces that you've written. Despite the current
resilience of the economy, I know you've got some warnings about how overstretched the market is, and I think you've written two pieces on that
recently. I guess real quick before we do, though, do we want to pull up the S&P chart that we look at every week just to get a quick sense? And if
there's anything on Simplevisor, the Simplevisor platform as well. By the way, you were telling us, I don't know, a couple weeks ago that you guys were
going to be launching a brand new version of that. Is that fully out in the world yet?
No, not yet. We're getting pretty close. We're putting the final kind of touches on it, and we're adding some new tools to it. So probably be another
month or so, but we're getting pretty close.
Okay, when it is, we'll dedicate half of this weekly market recap that week. It does go fully live, so you can walk folks through exactly all the
bills and muscles and benefits.
So just from a technical base, there is something kind of interesting going on over the last couple weeks. So we've kind of gone over this for the last
couple of weeks that the market's just kind of rising. It's been following the 20-day moving average. It's just been a regular buying program.
Every time the market comes down to the 20-day moving average, the computer algorithms kick in and start buying the stocks. And then as soon as
it gets to the top of the trend line, the sell signals kick on and they start selling them. And during that timeframe, momentum and relative
strength have been starting to degrade. And it's been kind of very unusual because relative strength has remained close to overbought for quite a
long time here. The MACD indicator has remained kind of stuck at a very high level for a very long time, which is fairly abnormal that it does
that. And again, we've had a very, very low volatility. Kind of this climb has been very, very low volatility up to this point. But the one
interesting thing is, is that the momentum of the rise is now slowing. And, you know, so I kind of drew this, you know, kind of this trend line
across the top and you kind of see it starting to kind of curve a bit and not keeping that same kind of sharp angle of advance that it had before.
And again, this all anecdotal at the moment. But it does suggest that we're beginning to see a bit of momentum kind of weakening even in the
price action. So, again, nothing wrong with the markets right now. We haven't violated the 20 day moving average. We came down on Friday
morning. We touched the 20 day bounce right off of it. The market started recovering. Again, the computer algorithm just started stepping in
and buying right at that level. But, you know, we are very extended here. This has been a very long advance since November. So again, we're
going to get a correction five to 10 percent at some point here. Ten percent correction is going to retest the 200 day moving average. And
that'd be completely normal. Nothing wrong with that at all. And it'd give you a much better opportunity to put capital to work in the
markets, you know, than versus right now. So it's just kind of the story remains the same. The market's overbought. It's extended. It's very
bullish. There's nothing wrong with the market at all at this point. But again, if we break that 20 day moving average, kind of that
running trend line, that's going to be a probably suggest a bigger correction. The 50 day moving average right now is sitting at 5000. You
break that. You're looking at 4600 ish, which is the 200 day moving average. So there is some room for a correction in there. Again,
completely normal. I would expect it sometime this year. And I would expect a correction before the presidential election.
Okay, so just to help folks looking at this here, the 50 day moving average is the red line. It's the lower red line here.
The 50 day is the blue line, the 200 days, the black line.
Oh, sorry, the 20 sorry.
This trend lines running right along the 20 day moving average, which is this red line.
Okay, great. Yep. Sorry. Thanks for confirming that. Alright, so red 20 blue 50 black 200. Now if we look down below to the RSI,
relative strength index, and you've got that wedge pattern you have there,
how much is it catching your attention that it seems to have just punctured below the support line there?
Well, again, this is what we've been kind of expecting that if this market is going to deteriorate, the relative strength index is going to
roll over. Hasn't done it yet. We've come down and kind of tested it, flirted with it and turned back up, you know, the next day, and it
stays within that channel. So again, you don't really read too much in an intraday move. And this is, as we're talking, it's Friday. So
don't read too much into an intraday move. What you're looking for is a weekly close that kind of really starts to suggest we've got a
violation. I'm not even that worried about relative strength until we violate the 20 day moving average and kind of, you know, trend
line saying that's been kind of running along these bottoms. I'm not real worried about anything until we take out that that kind of
that trend line support. We're on a MACD sell signal, but we've done that before, and it flips right back up again. So you know, again,
it's just this, what's abnormal is how complacent this market has been, and has remained overbought as long as it has. That's not
normally how the markets function. So it's certainly kind of abnormal bias, and it will end. It's just a question of when and what
causes it.
Okay, so let me ask you this. What indicator would cause you to take some action in your portfolio allocation?
Break the 20 day moving average, close below it, rally back to it, fail, and then turn and go lower. And if you do that, you've got a
confirmed break of that trend line, and then that's what you're looking for.
Okay, and I'm not asking for the specific trades you'll make, because you'll take that into the context of what's going on. But kind of
directionally, what do you think that would make you do? Would you move more to cash? Would you switch from one sector to another?
Both. Yeah, we would probably switch from growth to defense, and then raise a little bit of cash, and then see what the market does
from there. Again, a five to 10% correction is not worth doing a whole lot of stuff over.
Right, because it's pretty standard that hopefully should come and go and the market then recovers after that eventually.
Yeah, exactly. And that's normally what happens. And just like October, June, July, August, September, October last year had that 10%
correction, and it was a good buying opportunity. But there's a lot of companies that we own in our portfolio that we want to buy
more of. We recently bought a small position in Palo Alto network. So I'd love to have a correction in the market where I could buy
that one cheaper, add to that position, bring it up to target weight in the portfolio. There's other companies that we own that
we've taken profits in, like Apple, and I would love to buy some shares of that back cheaper. So there's companies that we don't
need to sell a whole lot of because we've already kind of reduced the weight of the position through rebalancing. And what we're
looking for is an opportunity to put the cash we have to work in those companies that are going to run with the markets when the
markets are running. Other areas that we would do is raise cash in areas and stocks that aren't performing well, and look to
redeploy that cash somewhere else opportunistically.
Okay. All right. And I guess just because you mentioned it, why Palo Alto Networks? I know they had a big correction, and largely I
think because you said they just tweaked their guidance a little bit, not even giving disappointing guidance, just saying they're
going to kind of, I can't remember what it was, they're positioning themselves, they're repositioning to make sure that they can
capitalize on their growth opportunity or whatever. And the market instantly took like a 20% haircut. But do you think the company
is particularly well run or just has great prospects, or as long as folks love AI, it's going to do well?
Well, no, I mean, you know, with what Palo Alto Networks does, and particularly in cybersecurity in that area, you know, yeah,
their earnings were good. Fundamentally, the company is killing it on all cylinders. And they said they're going to reposition,
you know, to make sure they can maintain longer term growth. It was actually a good move that the company made, and the stock was
down 26% on earnings day. So we bought a very small little starter position. It rallied off of that. It's coming back here a
bit. So we make it an opportunity to, you know, add into that position and continue to build it out. Plus, Nancy Pelosi bought a
position in it. So why not?
Exactly. But you can't go wrong if you're following her trades.
Yeah. All right. Well, look, actually, we bought ours before her. So it's okay.
Okay. Well, that's because I'm sure she watches this program. And when she said Lance's in, sign me up, right? I doubt that, but
okay.
All right. Well, look, do you want to talk about either of your recent pieces, since we're still here kind of on market valuation
side of things? You know, they're cautionary, right? They're not, you know, prepare for anything, perhaps beyond a 5% to 10%
correction, but they advance your thesis of, hey, look, we're pretty stretched here. And some sort of correction is, you know, some
sort of pullback is to be expected.
Yeah. Which one do you want to start with?
You know, I didn't even see your most recent one here. I was thinking of the digital currency and gold as speculative warnings, you
know, basically saying there's a lot of speculation going on in the market, but start with whatever one you want.
Okay. Well, let's start with that one. Because we also did the one on presidential election cycles, which is also kind of sets up
the case for the summer correction. But no, I thought this was interesting. Just, you know, fair statement. This is just
analysis. I'm not making a case. In fact, if you scroll to the bottom of this article, it says, not a recommendation. So, you
know, just and what this was, it was just pure analysis. I'm not making a case. If you're long goal, I don't care. You know,
that's, that's a you thing. I'm just making what I said, when I started digging into the data, what jumped out to me is that
we're seeing a very similar speculative push and a multitude of assets all at the same time. And that's very common that you
see that near peaks of market cycles where it's just basically everything's going up. So everybody's buying everything. And you
know, everybody's got a theme, you know, everybody's got a thesis for why they own it. Right. So I'm going to buy stocks,
because this is my thesis about a bull market. I'm going to buy, you know, I'm gonna buy Bitcoin because, you know,
Bitcoin is going to be the replacement for the currency. And I'm going to buy gold because the end of the world is going to be
whatever your thesis is. This has nothing to do with that. I don't care what your thesis is. This is simply technicals and
correlations. That's all this is. So but we're going through, we're looking at, you know, looking at how investors are
currently at it. So if we look at the dumb money index, which is how dumb money or retail investors are allocated to the
markets, and ever since the beginning of the year, institutions, smart money has been selling stocks to dumb money.
Remember that for every buyer, there has to be a seller. So if retail investors are piling into equities, somebody's got to be
selling to them. Right. So just, you know, we can't have a transaction without two sides to every transaction. So if you
measure what's going on, and this is kind of the interesting case, dumb money has been, you know, rising strongly ever
since really kind of that October low, they came, they were already pretty bullish going into that sell off in the
summer, pulled back a bit, and then really started kind of ramping it up. But if we start, if we subtract out the smart
money from from the dumb money, we see this very big spike in kind of dumb money investing. And that's just kind of reach
levels that normally coincide with at least short term market tops. It doesn't mean massive corrections. I'm not talking
about a crash, nothing like that. It's just that's just corrections five to 10%. Sometimes it's more sometimes it is a
recession, you know, type sell off, you get 20 or 25% downside, but more often than not, it's a five to 10% correction.
Cinnamon Trader, which puts out a bunch of great research, and had also the their sentiment cycle enthusiasm index, which
is also near record levels. And again, suggesting that you've got a lot of exuberance in the market. So if we take that
enthusiasm kind of look across the market, so of course, you take a look at company like Nvidia that's trading at, you
know, 30 to 33 times price to sales at the time I wrote this article, it's now 37 times price to sales because the
price goes up. You know, it's just you're paying a lot. And this isn't even the most expensive company Wingstop actually
has a higher price to sales ratio than Nvidia. They're not even an AI, they just sell chicken wings. So figure that out,
right. But take a look at companies like, you know, you know, a lot of these meme stocks that are out there getting
chased right now, you know, SCMI, the super microcomputer in the small cap stock space, you know, like 1000% this
year. So you know, it's just you see that kind of speculative activity in stocks. And so I started kind of looking
around at other markets, and, you know, and started looking at, you know, kind of the deviations from the norm and
other markets. And so it's important to understand standard deviation, which is how things move from norm. And if you
take a, you take a group of people, and you can measure their activities, and you kind of get this normalized bell
curve about how people act, but markets work the same way, stocks work the same way. And so, you know, one standard
deviation encompasses 68.2% of all potential price movement up and down, right, so 34% of the time, and one standard
deviation will be higher than the moving average, 34% of times will be lower than the moving average. If you step that
out, you know, you know, you add another 27.2% to that, that's two standard deviations. So now you're up in the 95%
range of all standard movement within two standard deviations. And once you get to three standard deviations, four
standard deviations from the norm, you're talking about 99.9999% of all potential price movement is already priced
into whatever activity has occurred. So that's basic, kind of a basic explanation of standard deviation. I explain this
in more detail in the article. Relative strength is also a measure of the movement. And so I explain relative strength
in the article as well. If you don't know what that is, you can just read the article and get a definition. But if you
take a look at Nvidia, it's trading more than three standard deviations above its 50 day moving average. So it's just
very, again, at the time I wrote this article, it's come back a little bit since then. But at that time, you know, it's
trading with a relative strength index of well over 70, it was above 80 at that point. 70 is, you know, very overbought.
So you've got a lot of, you know, basically everybody's going to buy something has been buying it. And when your four
standard deviations above its moving average, you know, you've priced in the bulk of whatever advance it was going to
make. So if you're expecting it to just keep going up, odds are likely that's not the case. You know, we've talked about
stretching a rubber band previously, you know, it stretches so far before it kind of comes back to the norm, but then
started looking at other assets. And then I looked at gold and gold's trading well into three standard deviation
territory, almost four. It's been a vertical spike up and it's trading well above set. Well, it was, again, this was a
few days ago, was trading well above 70 on the relative strength index, something it doesn't do very often, but it
does from time to time. And then you normally get a correction in gold prices after that. And the same thing with
Bitcoin, which has just kind of gone parabolic since the launch of ETFs trading with a relative strength index that
was actually near 90 at one point, it's cooled off a little bit. But again, so you just see kind of the same
narrative across all these assets of just a speculative investing. And they said, OK, well, let's take a look at the
index versus these other items. And so because of the price disparities between gold, the stock market and Bitcoin
had to rebase everything to 100. So going back to 2015, rebase everything to 100, you can see that when the market's
going up, gold has been basically tracking the market. And this was interesting to me because, you know, if you
think about gold, right, gold's an inflation hedge. And we had 9% inflation in 2022 and gold went down with the
market. So it didn't really hedge you for inflation at 9% during 2022. Since the bottom of the market in 2022, it's
been rallying with stocks. So it's become much more correlated to the stock market than really the dollar or
anything else. So if you really kind of want to know what direction gold is going to take in the near term, watch the
stock market, because again, it's become an asset that kind of trades with the market. Bitcoin, obviously, very much
similar. It rebase these two to 100 peaks and valleys almost correlate identically with what's going on in the stock
market. If you look at Bitcoin versus gold, you kind of see the same correlation pop back up. So again, it's just
interesting to me that we've got such a speculative narrative to this market and so much. And again, this goes back to
what we're talking about earlier. There's so much money piling into the market that it's just looking for somewhere
to go. So it's just now kind of going into any asset class that's moving, whatever's moving up, I'm just going to buy that
asset because it's going to keep moving up. So you're seeing the same thing kind of all across the market.
Alright, so this kind of goes back to the discussion that I was having with the Fleckenstein. If kind of all correlations are
going to one, and they're all showing excessive speculation. Every chart there was in the three standard deviations or higher
range. Does that make you worried that the market is vulnerable for another sort of 2022 scenario where when it does
reverse, I'm not saying by how much, but that kind of everything goes down together because it's all rising together right
now?
Yeah, no, I would precisely expect that to happen. I suspect that when in fact, if you let's just let me pop back to the article
real quick, because let me just go down to the very last part where I say, not a recommendation. This is not a recommendation,
right? This is just research. But I said, there are many narratives surrounding this is the last two paragraphs. There are many
narratives surrounding the markets, digital currency and gold. However, in today's market, more than the previous years, all
assets are getting swept up into the investor feeding frenzy. Sure, this time could be different. I'm only making an
observation and not an investment recommendation. However, from a portfolio management perspective, it will likely pay to
remain attentive to the correlated risk between asset classes. If some event causes a reversal and bullish exuberance, cash and
bonds may be the only safe place to hide.
Great. So let me ask you about that cash totally understandable. Now bonds. I mean, the big surprise of 2022 was that bonds went
down with stocks, and everything else, right? There kind of almost was no place to hide besides cash. If you just wanted to
preserve your capital, right? So has that correlation diverged between stocks and bonds so far enough where you think that
they'll play a balanced role again?
Yeah, we're seeing much more of that, you know, K over the year or so that, you know, in market down days, we've seen bonds
rise and market up days, we see bonds goes down, so they become more non correlated as of late. And again, you know, after
three years of having a bear market, again, bonds are strictly a function of economic inflation and economic growth. So as
those two continue to decline, and then if you throw in stress on top of that, into the financial markets, which are also probably
accelerate Fed rate cuts, then bonds should play very well, because as soon as the Fed starts cutting rates, yields are going to
fall because yields will track Fed rate cuts. So again, that's kind of all you're waiting for, for the old story to play out on
bonds.
Okay. All right, you had two other articles, we don't necessarily have to go through them all. But certainly the presidential one I
read was interesting. I know, we talked a little bit about that last week. Is there any more on that that you want to mention for
folks?
No, I think just the reality is that, you know, going into the, you know, if you want to try to time out the risk for some type of sell
off in the market, I think you really have to start looking at the, you know, that those couple of three months right before the
election. I think that's the, you know, with this market kind of flopped around, I mean, we could certainly have a correction before then. But,
you know, I think within that three month window to the November election, I think that we're gonna see a lot of rhetoric ramp up, you're
gonna see a lot of, you know, accusations flying back and forth. And that's probably gonna make the market nervous and not want to be, you
know, heavily long going into the election, not knowing the outcome.
Wait a minute, what rhetoric during an election here?
Yeah, can you imagine that mudslinging, etc?
All right, well, your other new piece, which looks like it's about household situations, or the condition of the American household. Let me bring up
this article that I wanted to walk through with you, because it's got some good charts, and maybe you can pull in any elements from your
recent article that are relevant. So here's a piece from Bloomberg, American debt stings like never before in new era for households,
right. So there's a couple of stats I've got here that I think show that, you know, we are beginning to see a manifestation of the lag effect, at
least in consumers and potentially now creeping into consumer spending. Right. So, you know, this article is basically profiles of a number of
different people who are, in some of their words, one of these women here is quoted saying, "I'm making more than I've ever made before. And yet
I'm finding it harder to get by than it's ever been before." Right. Where the cost of living and the cost of credit is really beginning to bite. So
you'll see here interest payments by US households, both mortgage and non mortgage are increasing again, non mortgage related interest payments,
these are things like credit cards, auto loans, and whatnot, are just shooting the moon here in the past year plus. Let's see here, this is the
woman who said, "Yeah, I'm making the most money I've ever made. And I'm still living paycheck to paycheck." There's a wild disconnect between
what people are experiencing, and what economists are experiencing. And, you know, I spent a lot of time reading articles, I'm seeing a lot more
like this in the media. But I will just say anecdotally, in terms of the people that reach out to me via social media, email and whatnot, I'm hearing
just a lot more of this going on. This like, wait, I'm being told one thing, but it is just not matching my lived experience. Households take on debt
faster than before the financial crisis. This is aggregate US credit card balances, they've just surpassed over a trillion for the first time ever. A
reminder that the APRs on this credit card debt are at record highs as well. So not only do we have, by far, the highest consumer debt balance and
credit cards, but it's costing folks the most as well. Obviously, this hits lower the meager and moderate household much more than it does the high net
worth household. There's one or two other charts here I wanted to show. So the chart title here is lowest earners see the biggest increase in
delinquencies, which is true, that's the black line here, but you'll see delinquencies for everybody is going up here. And you can see they were at
some crazy low back here in 2021, where they weren't even processing delinquencies, and there was forbearance, and everybody was getting their checks
and all that stuff. But you can see the trajectory here amongst all quartiles, even the quite wealthy are on an upward trajectory here. So they're
basically citing higher borrowing costs are the things that are keeping people up, the return of student loan payments, as a lot of people stressed
out. So you're just seeing more and more signs in the real economy of the people that are having to get up every day, live their lives, that it's getting
tougher and tougher. And I just want to combine this with some recent other news. So retail sales, they disappointed in February, they did rise, but
they rise less than folks were expecting. And the big miss on retail sales that was reported in January was revised down even further. So somewhat to be
expected. Your consumers are struggling, they're beginning to actually pull back on their pocketbooks. And then the New York Fed's manufacturing survey
just came in at negative 20.9, which is still in contraction. And I know we are not nearly as much of a manufacturing economy, Lance, as we used to be.
But this thing's been stuck in contraction for the past two years. So there's just lots of data that's out there that are just showing that spending is
beginning to slow. People are beginning to really begin to get to the pain point of I'm living paycheck to paycheck, I don't know how much more I'm
going to be able to do that. And it's beginning to create more and more into the economic data. Now, you've said the economy is slowing down. I think the
big question this all raises is how far is the momentum going to continue from here?
Well, I think, first of all, too, I think this brings up a good point that if you take a look at a lot of the data that economists throw out, kind of a
mainstream economists are like, Oh, don't worry about the economy. Look at the debt to income ratios. It's still very low. It's way below where it was
pre-pandemic. If you take a look at the savings ratio, households have a bunch of excess savings, nothing to worry about in the economy. Well, the problem
with all of that is that it's heavily skewed by the top 10% of income earners who have a lot of cash and no debt.
Right. It's mean versus median, right? Yeah. And I've done the analysis on this before. I've written articles about it. So you got to be really
careful with that data. So it's not nearly as robust as it looks. And this is why there's this big dichotomy between what the economists say and then
everybody else on the street going, my life, I'm barely making ends meet. I can't buy my groceries. Inflation is killing me, blah, blah, blah. But
yet the economic data says everything is just fine. So again, that's why you've got to really parse a lot of this headline data with what's happening in
the real world and keep a watch on the real time indicators that actually impact the average American. And so when you take a look at how much money
they have in savings, $500, those type of things, there's a very short runway between where they are right now and basically being in bankruptcy.
Well, so let's pull up to the higher level here for a second. How concerned are you about this? The affluent, they're overspenders. They spend
disproportionately. They're big supporters of the economy. As long as asset prices continue to go up, they're the primary benefits of that. And that
will manifest to a certain extent and more spending from them. But if the majority of the country continues to slump downwards into this, just hanging
on by their fingernail stage and more and more people actually lose their grip, can the affluent household keep this thing afloat or at some point is
the math tip where it says, "Look, there's just enough people who are really having hard times that it really is going to impair the ability of the
economy to grow."
Well, yeah. I mean, look, the 20% can't support 80% forever, right?
That's basically my question.
The bottom 80% spends almost the entirety of their check. They live basically paycheck to paycheck. There's very little excess savings. So yeah,
the 20%, they can spend above their norms for a while. But at some point, even the affluent have bought everything they're going to buy.
There are only so many jet skis you can own, right?
Exactly. I mean, great. I went on this kind of revenge spending post-COVID. So I've been traveling a lot. I've been doing a lot of extra stuff
that I didn't do before. But after a while, you're going to go, "Well, okay, I've done all that." And it's going to slow down. Also, at some
point, the concerns of the economy are going to weigh through. A lot of the people that are affluent are also business owners. So at some
point, if that spending begins to slow down, we're seeing this. And every month when we get the NFIB report out, we're seeing... And the
NFIB Confidence Survey just rolled over again. It's heading lower again, staying in recessionary territory. But you take a look at
expectations of sales and those type of things, employment, labor, all those indicators are all getting worse. So there's going to be a
point to where even those affluent people, "I'm a little bit concerned about where this economy is. I'm going to start clamping up my
spending a little bit. Just be careful." That's all it's going to take. And that'll shift that over to the other side.
Okay. And this is like, the folks that say, "Hey, Adam, you tend to lean bearish." If I do, this is sort of at the root of it, which is I track the
condition of the American consumer pretty closely and have these concerns. And I'd say that the concern I have right now is that I don't see a lot
of hope, I guess, on the horizon for a material reversal of this, where we pick up the bottom 80% or even the middle class part and start
re-elevating that. I'd love to be wrong. Maybe AI is going to be this great productivity enhancer that lets everybody benefit. I'm a little afraid
that AI is actually going to be a job destroyer for a lot of this cohort that we're talking about. So I don't know. One of the reasons why I keep
revisiting this whole wealth disparity and this whole where the American consumer is going, because I feel like to your point, Lance, we're all in this
boat together. And if important cohorts really start struggling, no matter where you are in the socio-economic spectrum, it's going to impact you
eventually.
Well, no, it is. Look, AI is not going to be a benefit to the bottom 80% of Americans. It's interesting, there was a chart on Twitter I put out the other
day showing productivity at multi-decade highs. And that's been a function of stock buybacks, and offshoring, and automation, and robotics, and
everything else. So we displaced a lot of labor that we've replaced with other substitutes to enhance earnings and profitability. And again, how do we
measure productivity? It's revenue per worker. So if I have a dollar's worth of revenue, and I can reduce my workers, then revenue per worker goes up.
That's how we measure productivity. It's not, "Oh, I have the same number of workers, and they're all just producing a whole bunch more." That's not what's
going on here and hasn't been. And this is why you take a look at full-time employment. Actually, this weekend's newsletter is talking about full-time
employment as a recessionary indicator, because the year-over-year rate of change in full-time-
I'm sorry, I don't know what this full-time employment is that you talk about, because apparently, we haven't created any full-time jobs in like over a
year.
Well, that's right. And so full-time employment itself is now negative on a year-over-year basis. And full-time employment relative to the population has
also turned sharply lower. Both of those are things that occur preceding a recessionary onset. And it makes complete sense, because you have to have a
full-time job to pay bills and have health benefits and all those type of things. Part-time jobs don't cover that.
Okay. And this again, and then I'll get off this. This is why I find it personally challenging to really buy into the uber bullish case of like,
"Hey, just don't worry. Things are just going to keep heading higher for as long as we can imagine from here." And it's because I see this reckoning, I
think, that is coming, which is that, "Hey, look, if we don't alter the current trajectory, we're going to get to that tipping point where there are
too many people below the waterline, where everybody gets dragged into it." Now, I'd love to be wrong. I still try to keep a very open mind. I'm totally
open to the fact that markets could run higher for all this year. And that's why we have you here every week, Lance, is to keep us focused on the markets we
have, not the markets that we think should exist. But I am just sort of doing some personal sharing here, which is, of all the things that sort of sit in my
mind, that's probably the one that sits there the most persistently and loudly, right?
Yeah. Well, and again, there's not a direct linkage between the economy and the stock market. And what I mean by that is that the stock market can deviate
from the actual economics for quite some time.
Absolutely.
Unfortunately, the stock market will always return to economic realities. It's just what causes that to occur. And that's kind of
evident in what we're seeing going on with a lot of the speculation chase. We're seeing it across multiple asset classes, et cetera. They're all deviating
from actual economic realities. And so, again, at some point, earnings and revenue are a function of economic activity. So as that activity slows, so too
will revenue growth and earnings. And that's where profitability becomes an issue. And you either have to maintain profit by reducing the labor force,
but you can only do that so far. You can continue to outsource. You can only do that so long. And you can only buy back so many shares to reduce your
earnings per share. So all these factors kind of play in. And in fact, I was just posting a chart out this morning on Twitter that we've had, without stock
buybacks, there's been absolutely negative earnings growth. So that's the problem that we've got going on. And we can kind of support this data for a
while, but eventually, economic realities are going to matter, just a question of when.
All right. Well, folks, if what we're saying is resonating with you, we will keep tracking all this week after week after week going forward. All right, Lance,
I got a couple of other quick stats, and then I want to get to the rant. And I want to give you time, which you asked for last week, to talk about
the difference between constitutional republic and democracy. If you're still amped up to do that, I'll give you the floor.
Whatever you want to do.
All right. Just real quick, I want to note a few stats on housing. We're beginning to see supply come onto the market in parts of the country, so
particularly in the southeast. A lot of southern states are now seeing pretty robust double digit increases in inventory. Florida has
had a 46% increase in inventory. So as so goes inventory, so should follow prices. We've had this big stalemate as the market's really frozen with
higher interest rates and sellers not wanting to sell. That's beginning to change, at least in the southeast. Let's see what happens as time goes on
here. But that's not evenly distributed. So in New York, rents are actually moving back up. Finding a home in New York has "become a
nightmare" according to a recent report that just came out. A New York State Assembly member just warned, "Housing affordability is at a crisis
level in New York City. More than half of renters are rent burdened. New housing construction is not keeping pace with population growth."
And Goldman then adds on top of that, "One major problem deferring new affordable housing in metro areas is that office tower prices are still too
high for conversions." So what's interesting here is that New York obviously is still in the throes of its own housing freeze. Interesting that
tower prices haven't come down yet, especially with all the commercial real estate issues going on. I just feel like that's probably just a matter of
time. Is this a situation, Lance, where you think that high prices become the cure for high prices?
Yeah, eventually. Look, we're seeing cracks all over the commercial real estate market. You know, the one thing, though, there's a lot of people that are betting on this massive collapse that's going to come from commercial real estate.
It's probably not going to happen because, and I'm not saying the prices won't go down in commercial real estate, we're not going to see, and we're seeing buildings get sold off for 20 cents on the dollar, all kinds of things that are going on.
But this is such a well-known problem that the market's already working through this. And so it's not going to be, this isn't going to be the catalyst for a financial crisis, right?
Everybody's too aware of it, the bond market's aware of it, the credit markets are aware of it, the banks are aware of it, the Feds are aware of it. And so this is already getting worked through, and we'll get through it and we'll look back and go, "Man, there's a bunch of great deals on commercial real estate."
I mean, there's going to be some people that make a killing on commercial real estate 10 years from now because they're buying buildings at 20, 25 cents on the dollar, forcing out predators, forcing out equity players, renovating it into either new commercial space or multifamily or whatever they're going to do with it.
There's going to be a lot of money made in that space, but it's not going to be the crisis event that everybody keeps expecting, just like high interest rates didn't cause a housing crash.
And I will say, one of the, a person might actually be watching this video, one of the folks that has been following my work for a number of years got to meet this person at an event, and their backstory was they're well off, and they're well off because a grandparent, I think it was a grandmother,
bought a Central Park West property, buildings, not just apartments, but the entire buildings, back in the '70s during one of the big real estate busts there. And basically the family after that for several generations just didn't have to work because she just bought in right at the right time.
It sounds like you're saying we may be in a similar era like that. Now, you'll probably have to wait maybe a decade or more before it gets back to that kind of state, but it's blood on the streets in commercial real estate, or at least getting there.
All right, so we don't need to spend much time on this. I just want to note it largely because we work in media here, Lance, but just curious if you've got anything you want to say about the new TikTok legislation that's out there, which basically is
-- in fact, I haven't really been following it that closely, but I think it's not quite a ban on TikTok, but if it's going to be allowed to operate in the US, it's got to be owned by US interests and not by foreign interests. I know there's a lot of First Amendment freedom of speech,
and there's freedom of speech in this because I think some folks are saying, "Look, the way the current bill is written, it's way too broad, and it's providing a door for the government to get in and censor media companies when they want to." But just curious if you have any thoughts one way or the other on it.
Well, yeah, this isn't a TikTok ban, right? So they say that TikTok needs to be banned because it's a Chinese company, right? But the data is housed on servers in Texas, run by Oracle. 60% of the company is owned by investors. Most of those are United States investors. 20% is owned by the employees of the company, right? So it's employee-owned. And 20% is owned by the people that actually owned it. So they're Chinese, right?
But the whole thesis behind why they're banning TikTok is not valid. If you actually read it, what it allows the president to do is to ban any website that they feel is that is acting in terms of election interference. That's what this is really getting down to.
So what's going to be really interesting about this is that this authority, you're giving very broad authority to the president to act kind of in an authoritarian manner on any website that they deem to be an election threat.
So this is going to be interesting to see how this works out because obviously, you know, Twitter has run afoul of what the government wants, you know, kind of everybody to play in party line, right? So Facebook fell in line, Google fell in line.
It's going to be interesting because there's already been a lot of angst about Twitter and Rumble and a lot of these other social media platforms that will potentially fall underneath this regulation. If it passes, it's passed the House, but it's still passed the Senate.
And you're starting to see a lot of people actually read the context of the ban and go, wait a minute, this isn't what we're actually being told is the reason we're banning TikTok.
And it's also quite fascinating that the president just got on TikTok and started the TikTok channel maybe.
And now we're going to ban it. Look, there's a lot of congressmen and others that have, you know, large followings on TikTok. And, you know, this is how you communicate with your, you know, the people you're trying to influence to vote for you, right?
So you're putting out your policies and whatever you want, you know, you're kind of cutting off your nose to spite your face. And I'm not even sure what the real benefit of doing this is. It's, again, the data is all in Texas. The data is run by Oracle.
We have access to all that data. You know, if you're worried about your data being shared, that's happening. Amazon, Google, everything you do, all that data is being shared, right?
So you don't have any privacy in terms of your data. So this doesn't solve any of that problem.
But, yeah, I don't really understand it, but, you know, it is what they want to do.
All right. Well, let me say this. I don't have a lot of love for TikTok. I don't think it's a very good, you know, net influence on our society.
Hold on, say that. But you have to say that in the context of, is Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, are those any better?
I'm going there. I'm going there. I was just literally going to say, and this is not related, this is not exclusive or contained to just the TikTok.
You know, any parent, especially of preteens or teens, right, knows the toxic and corrosive effect that social media has had on our kids, right?
So I'm professing no particular love for TikTok here. My concern, which you just elaborated way better than I did, is that this doesn't really even seem to be a bill that's really about TikTok in the big picture.
It's about executive action to be able to basically curtail content that the administration finds problematic, right?
And what worries me about that is we just, I mean, this isn't that academic, right? We're just a few years past a time in history where we had a bunch of sweeping centralized authority decisions being made that,
once the dust settled, have been walked back and saying, yeah, you know what, we were probably wrong about that. We probably shouldn't have done it that way, right?
And I can get into a bunch of different examples, but I don't want to stir up partisan pushback. And folks, I can come up with examples on every side of the aisle here, so I'm not going after any one particular party.
But yeah, to me, that just seems like the way it's currently been described as a real Pandora's box if it got opened. And look, do I think my little corner of the media world is at risk by this?
I don't think by this bill, no, but I think it definitely puts us on our trajectory that eventually, yeah, maybe one day you and I are talking and we don't like something that the current president is doing, no matter who's president at that time.
And then all of a sudden, maybe some algo that's been written to sniff out anything that contradicts the official narrative, bans us, right?
I agree with everything you're saying. I think the thing that, look, the unfortunate thing that's occurred over the last several years, and this actually started under the Obama administration itself in the second term, it started getting a lot worse.
But there used to be a time in history where we could all sit around and have political dialogue, and I could say, this is my view, you could say this is your view, and we could agree to even disagree.
But there was a point to where we could actually have a dialogue and you could actually get access to all the facts.
And that's not even available anymore, because if there's certain facts that Google doesn't like, they get suppressed, so you can't get access to them.
We can't have a conversation about an issue without somebody getting offended, so nobody wants to talk about anything now because we don't want to offend you.
What you said to yourself is, hey, I'm not picking on anybody, so I don't want to get a bunch of emails. I get it, right? You can't even have a conversation.
The bigger picture, though, is you're giving one guy the authority to limit speech without really any oversight.
And look, if you say, look, we need a bill that says we need to stop this type of information, because this reminds me a lot of the McCarthy era, back in history.
We were just calling everybody was a communist at that point. If you didn't like the way they were acting, they were a communist and they got investigated.
And that was a terrible time in US history. And we're repeating a lot of that today by a lot of these actions.
And the consequence sounds fine. Right now, we're like, we're going to give the president authority to do this. You're like, yeah, that's great, right?
We're going to shut down Twitter and Elon Musk and X, right? So that's awesome.
But the next president comes along and says, OK, you know what? I'm going to shut down Facebook. You're not going to have Facebook or I'm going to shut down Instagram.
So now you don't have Instagram. You're giving one guy an authority to do a whole lot of stuff that these are things we should be having votes on.
Where these are put out for a vote. We vote on these bills.
And it's just like in the city of Houston, if you want to pass a bill to have a rain tax, which was a stupid thing we did a few years back.
We taxed rainwater flow because we needed we had too much concrete in Houston.
So. Bill, when everybody got to vote on it and it got passed and great.
So now we have a rate so stupid tax, but we have a rainwater tax. These are the types of things that we should be doing, right?
This is how the Constitution was designed to give a certain set of rights.
Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of illegal search and seizure, those type of things.
All those rights were all laid out. And we consistently tried to erode those rights under the name of national security.
And we say, oh, we need to do this because this is a national security issue.
And you wind up giving up a whole lot of your rights under this guise of national security.
Well, the problem is, is that you're giving up more and more of your rights to be safe and eventually you'll have no rights, but you'll be safe.
Well, it's the classic Benjamin Franklin, right? Those that would give up their freedoms in exchange for security deserve neither.
Yeah. And that's kind of and that's and unfortunately, that's just that. And it's just a slippery slope, right? It's just this one bill.
But then this one bill goes to another bill and this other bill. And we've already had a bunch of these bills, right?
We've done all kinds of bills to control the Internet and to control information flows and all these type of things.
And we've given people all kinds of rights to data and access to data. And it's all fine, right?
And as long as you're happy with it, that's okay. Just realize it's a slippery slope that you're going down and you keep giving up incremental rights under this name of national security.
All right. Well, look, let's jujitsu from this topic to your points that you wanted to make last week about the understanding and appreciating the difference between a constitutional republic and a pure democracy.
Well, I just you know that, you know, just kind of last week there was a bunch of of a commercials and there was a lot of talk about, you know, the we need to protect democracy, right?
Democracy is at risk in this next election, right? So we've got to have this election because we have to defend democracy.
It's important to understand if you're going to go vote. And I just had this and the reason it came up because I had just had this conversation with my daughter.
So she's she's turning 21 in April. She went registered to vote and I'm like, set her down.
And I said, OK, well, that's great. I'm so happy you registered to vote. You're going to participate in the political system.
What does that mean to vote? Right. We just started with a very basic kind of premise.
And, you know, she says, well, we're a democracy. I go, well, stop right there because we're not a democracy.
And she goes, what do you mean we're not a democracy? I said, we're not a democracy. A democracy is mob rule.
Right. So it's 51 percent of the people say this is what we're going to do.
It doesn't matter what the other 49 percent of the people want to do. That's what we're going to do.
And if you take a look at how the United States is, is basically divided.
Right. You have all your major cities, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Dallas, Florida, Miami, New York, all your major cities.
Chicago is up there. All your major cities are basically clustered in just a handful of states.
So, in other words, if you go to just a pure democracy and we got out a map and we looked at where all the major cities were,
basically five states would control every outcome of every election.
Right. Because that's where more than 51 percent of the population lives.
You know, states like Wyoming, states like Idaho, North Carolina, no vote.
They have no say in the political process because it'll all be controlled by the major cities.
And that's why a democracy is not a good system, because it is a mob rule system.
We are a constitutional republic.
And this was really well thought out by our founding fathers who, you know, they came over here from a basically an aristocracy dictatorship.
Came over here and said, we don't want that to ever happen again.
And so they they crafted out this constitution and said, this is how we're going to operate the country.
We're going to have the separation of branches, you know, and we're going to operate under this idea of a representative republic.
And so each state will have representatives and those representatives will basically vote on supposed to vote, by the way, for the will of their population.
So in other words, senators and congressmen from California are supposed to vote on bills and and actions that comply with what Californians want.
Ones from Texas are supposed to do the same thing now doesn't always work out because we've allowed too many corporations to interfere and enter our political process.
But that's the way it was laid out and supposed to be structured.
This is why it's broken down the way it is.
So the population for each state is broken down and you have in Congress, you have representatives based on the population of each state and every state has two senators.
And so this is why it's broken down that way.
And so that they're supposed to vote the will. And this is also why we're the Electoral College.
A lot of people I've seen lately, we need to get rid of the Electoral College, right? We just need to go to the majority vote.
Well, again, this is a problem because what the Electoral College does is it gives states like Wyoming, which has a total population of five hundred thousand people,
the same vote in the election and the electoral process that a state like California has.
So this this gives every state, regardless of their population, a vote and a voice within the political process.
And this is why it's so important when when you hear the media come out and say, well, we have to defend democracy.
No, we need to defend the constitutional republic because that's what we are.
We are a constitutional republic based on a representative structure of the voice of the population.
Congress and Senate and the president is supposed to work for we the people, not go do whatever they freaking want to do up there and just act willy nilly.
They're supposed to be representing the will and the action of the voting public.
And this is why when we go to the polls, as I was explaining to my daughter, is that you need to vote for people.
I don't care what their party is, is vote for the person that is going to represent the things that you believe in and the things that you want and the things that are going to make the economy, your life, those a better a better place to be.
And don't just vote for somebody because of their one party or the other.
That's the problem. And, you know, so we have this conversation. But, you know, again, it's it's important to understand that as a democracy, that is a mob rule.
And that is that is nothing like what how the United States is currently structured.
But it is a way that we have been pushing over the last few years.
The last couple of years we've had, you know, elections that have been highly contested. And it's like, well, this person won all the popular vote. Doesn't matter. You can win the popular vote and still lose the Electoral College because of the way it's broken down.
You know, that's that's okay. That's the way the system is supposed to work.
All right, I'm sure we're gonna get a ton of comments around this, you know, I think, and I'm not a constitutional scholar, so I'm just talking off the top of my head here. But I think part of the representative form of government we have right now, too, is
to provide, you know, accountability in the sense of like, if it's just pure mob rule, right, and everybody gets a vote, and there are implications of that vote, there's nobody to go to and hold accountable and say, "Well, hey, you need to do this definitely next time."
Right, where if there is a guy whose neck is on the line, right, you know, he's the one that everybody can go to and say, "Hey, we need to, you know, I've got a different opinion," or, "Hey, we didn't get the results we wanted. We want to change tack."
Right, you've got somebody who's sort of at the nexus of all that. And you said that they're supposed to represent the will of their constituents. And I agree with that largely.
I think, though, that the system is structured that way so that they're supposed to serve for the benefit of their constituents. And this means sometimes what the constituents ask for isn't necessarily the right thing to do.
And part of a representative's role at certain times is to say, "Look, I got to make some tough decisions that might not be necessarily politically popular in the moment, but maybe setting us up for the right benefits down the road."
Really good example is, "Hey, you know, we just saw this, right? Inflation spiking. So what is the public demand?" Well, please, you know, send a stimulus, right? And totally get it because families are just focused on trying to put food on the table tonight, right?
But that cure is actually making the disease even worse, right? And so to a certain extent, I think back then, well, very wisely, they said, "Look, anybody who wins the vote can become the elected representative."
There was sort of an acknowledgement of, "Hey, a lot of our population isn't super educated, and we're going to let the people that maybe have a greater set of skills to benefit the public good can be making the smart decisions and just not implementing
willy-nilly what 51% of the subsistence farmers are asking for right now, right?" And I know that sounds kind of classist, and I'm not trying to not try to disparage the average person, although you go on TikTok, you see a lot of these like man on the street,
you know, interviews they do, and you're like, "Oh, my God, I can't believe we have people like that in the world," right? So there is a little bit of a safeguard, right, where you have a position that somebody has to work to earn to get that sort of demonstrates
both their commitment, but their capabilities along the way to do the job well. And then hopefully, when they're there, they serve for the benefit of the populace. Now, as you said earlier, Lance, we can spend a lot of time talking about how that system has
been totally perverted and corrupted by special interests and outside money and, you know, people gaming the system. And now, you know, becoming a politician, if you're lucky enough to get elected, especially into National Post.
I mean, it's like a gravy train, right? You get lifelong benefits, you get all sorts of offers from all sorts of special interests to put you on their boards and stuff like that when you come out of office.
So I'm one of the first to say, "Look, the system is not working the way that it was originally designed," but I appreciate what you're talking about in terms of truly understanding why it was set up the way that it set up.
Well, and I think, though, this is also why that we need to have a serious conversation about getting corporations out of the voting process. You know, this, you know, having super PACs, having political action committees, having super PACs where, you know,
these candidates can absorb a lot of money from corporations. And, you know, also the fact that, you know, corporations can make donations to politicians. Corporations are technically entities, right?
But they're not voting citizens. And again, Congress is supposed to represent the will of the people, but how can they represent the will of the people if their loyalty is being bought by massive donations and keeping them in office for decades upon decades,
you know, through these political campaigns, these political donations, those type of things. You know, there was a time where it was OK.
That, you know, but it's gotten so egregious. And now we see that a lot of bills that are getting written, they're being written by the corporations themselves. The corporations write the bill, send it over to the, you know, through their lobbies and send it to the Congressman.
The Congressman says, "Oh, I've got this bill. And here I'm presenting this bill." And we find out that it benefits some particular company or some particular group that were heavy campaign donors for this particular congressman.
And that's not the point is that's not the way the system is supposed to work. And to your point, it's been heavily influenced by that.
So there's not the the the congressman and the senators no longer work for the people.
They work for the corporations or, quote unquote, they work for the people with the money.
And that's not the way it's supposed to be. And there's and there's fixes for that. Right. We can just get rid of all that.
We can say, look, every you know, every person wants to donate, you can donate five hundred dollars to whatever congressman you want.
Right. Whatever political person you can donate five hundred bucks. And television stations, you're going to have to allot a specific radio stations, TV stations, YouTube, whatever.
You have to allot a specific amount of time equally across every candidate for advertising.
They can't pay for it. You can't take money for it.
But as being a media outlet, this is what you're signing up for. And you're going to have to allot this this amount of time and doesn't have to be a lot.
It can be, you know, you know, 30, 32nd commercials, whatever it is per candidate. And they get their message out and the rest of it.
They're going to have to do like they did in the old day. They're out to do campaign stops and go town to town and knock on doors and do flyers.
They're going to do the hard work. You know, I'm sorry, but that's what you signed up for being a congressman.
So I'm there with you and it might be fun to riff more on the actual solutions at some point on this if folks are interested. We haven't lost everybody already.
But to just to this point, I mean, you remember from your event in Houston from a month and a half ago, I'm liking the guy's name, Greg.
You remember in the Q&A, you know, I asked him, I said, Well, look, you know, what's the biggest problem right now with the political system?
Because he was talking about a lot of the issues that it had. And I said, you know, at the root, what are the biggest problems?
And I said, Is it too much money in politics? And I was about to go on. He just interrupted me. He said, That's it. He said, That's the whole enchilada.
The system is just too corrupted. It's way too bought and paid for. So absolutely right. All right, well, look, we'll start wrapping up here.
I've just got a couple of, I think, updates folks, you're going to want to hear here. Again, a reminder, I am going to be largely taking off next week,
though there will mostly be content on this channel, including the reaction to the FOMC minutes and the Jerome Powell press conference next week.
So that'll be Axel Merck and I. And again, we'll be holding a live event for the premium members on our sub stack and then everybody else will get the replay
video of that on this channel the day after. Reminder, too, if you didn't attend the conference, really wish you had, want to get the replay video of the whole
event and the live Q&A's from it, just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com/conference. You can purchase those replays there.
I do just want to give a quick heads up about a coming improvement that's coming to our sub stack.
So I'm not sure everybody really understands what you get for subscribing to the sub stack.
You probably hopefully remember that that's where I publish my notes, which are my takeaways, my summaries of all the interviews that happen on this channel.
So if you don't want to furiously scribble notes and just listen and then go read my summary afterwards, you get that.
Or if you don't have time to listen to the full interview and just want to get the précis of it, you can go and get it from those notes.
But it also offers the membership also acts as a discount card, as you've heard me as I've been talking about the conference.
If you are a premium sub stack member, you get $50 off no matter what the price is of the conference, whether it's the early bird price or the full price,
full ticket price. So, I mean, for those who are subscribed at the old $8 a month version, if you went to the conference,
I mean, that saved you more than two thirds of what you already paid for your annual membership.
But we also have live events like the Axl Merck meeting that's coming up here that I just mentioned.
We're also going to be bringing back the Ask Anything Live advisor Q&As on a regular basis.
Again, those will be made live available exclusively to the premium subscribers.
But now we have another thing that I'm going to be launching probably in the next couple of weeks.
I'm still trying to figure out exactly what to call it, but for lack of a better name right now, I'm calling it the macro pass,
which is the brand promise of thoughtful money is bringing in the best minds and money in the markets to you, the viewer.
A lot of the people that appear on this channel have premium analysis that they publish, newsletters, whatnot.
I have reached out to a number of the folks that I respect the most who come on this channel and ask them if they wouldn't mind
sharing periodically some of their premium reports with this audience, and so I've gotten overwhelming response to this.
So it's going to be on a weekly basis. Each week, there's going to be a new premium report from one of the people
who appear on this channel that's going to be sent to my premium Substack subscribers.
I'll be sharing the names of you, of everybody that's on the list, but right now it's already crossing into the several dozen stage.
So basically, this is sort of like one of those -- I'm trying to get the right analogy here.
It's kind of maybe like those wine bars that you go into where you don't have to buy the full bottle.
You can just buy a glass of each of the really expensive wines there, so you get to sort of sample them all.
Maybe it's like a ski pass. I know up in Tahoe here, there's a whole bunch of different mountains.
You buy a ski pass, you can ski any one of those mountains on any day.
So this is a way for you going forward to get a ton of additional really valuable premium content from a wide range of these experts.
And again, that's all wrapped into the low $15 a month price, less than 50 cents a day.
You get all of those things that I just mentioned.
So more detail on that, especially the macro pass as it launches in the next couple of weeks.
But I just want to make sure that folks really understood what the premium substack subscription offers to you.
All right. And then just as we begin to wrap up here, as Lance and I talked about before we got into the whole political form of governance discussion here,
the markets are overstretched here. There's definitely increasing uncertainty heading into an election year.
If you're having trouble or concerns navigating that on your own, especially if you're like most people, you have a real life.
You've got way other demands on your time and your focus.
I'll reiterate my usual advice that just about everybody watching this program, unless they're a highly experienced and successful DIY investor,
work under the guidance of a good professional financial advisor who takes into account all the macro issues that Lance and I have talked about here
in this conversation, as well as the macro views of all the folks that come on this channel with me.
If you've got a good advisor who's doing all that for you, great, stick with them.
But if you don't, or you'd like a second opinion from one who does, maybe even Lance and his team there at Real Investment Advice,
then consider scheduling a free consultation with one of the financial advisors that Thoughtful Money endorses.
To do that, just go fill out the short form at ThoughtfulMoney.com, only takes you a couple seconds to fill out the form.
You're going to get a completely personalized and bespoke consultation with these guys where they tell you exactly what they think you should do,
giving your own unique specific situation and needs. There's no cost to these consultations.
There's no commitment to work with these guys. It's just a free public service that they offer.

All right, thanks so much, Lance, everybody else. Thanks so much for watching.
Thanks for watching.
