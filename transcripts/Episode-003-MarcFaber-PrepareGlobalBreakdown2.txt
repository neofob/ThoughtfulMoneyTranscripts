Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. Thanks for joining us for part two of our interview with investing legend Dr. Mark
Farber. If you haven't yet watched part one of our discussion with Mark in which he warns that investment returns enjoyed over the past several
decades are now relics of history and we should prepare for more disappointing markets ahead, be sure to catch that after watching this video.
Okay, let's get started watching part two of our interview with Dr. Mark Farber. I was just at a conference headed the real privilege of moderating a
panel that I was actually not supposed to moderate. The moderator, fellow named Gary Alexander of Navalier Associates was supposed to
moderate it and he ended up not feeling well so I had to step in at the last minute. Great panelist, Matt Taibbi was on there, a few other great
minds. I kicked off the panel with reading some of Gary's prepared notes and I'd just like to read it to you quickly and get your reaction to it.
Here's what he said. He said, "I never thought I would say this, but the last two decades since George Bush and Karl Rove have made me say that the
20th century looks like responsible government spending and control by comparison to the 21st century so far. The federal deficit has
exploded tenfold since 9/11. It looks like Obama bin Laden won on that fateful day. He turned us into paranoid terrorist fighters, overseas
warmongers, homeland spies of our own people, and terminal spendthrifts." I'd like to get your reaction to that and if so, what causes in your
estimation are principally responsible for this?
Well, that's a good question. What is responsible for developments in societies, which way they go and so forth?
In general, I don't believe that the system of democracy, the way we have it, will work. I don't think that a system where everybody can vote
will work, and it will be abandoned and taken away by the elite. The elite, and I'm not calling the elite in a negative connotation, but if you
look at history of mankind, say 5,000 years of reasonably well documented history, there were always some people at the top of the
government, at the top of the wealth pyramid, and there were lots of poor, and lots of what I would call in quotation marks "slaves", the
people that have to work and so forth, in whatever form they were kept. But there were always the royals at the top. The American natives had
chieftains and so forth, and in what we used to call primitive societies, they also have chieftains and so on. And we will go back to that
society. The question is, will we have a leader that is an unpleasant leader, who is like Stalin, you know, where you have essentially no
freedom, or is it a relatively benign leader, like Trajan was at the time of the Romans and so forth. So this is the question going forward. But
the tendency of a government to grow is always there, because the bureaucracy, in order to survive, they will like a grow stock, like Procter and
Gamble is a gross company. They have always new products, they expand in new markets, they expand into new countries, the government will always
expand its power. And so they keep on growing and growing and growing. At the end, everything is government and the private sector is very small.
And the war is business. A lot of people make a lot of money out of wars. And I'm not even talking about the military complex, but say, we have a huge
immigration problem in Europe. Some people will deny that it's a problem. I think it is a problem. We have all these North Africans coming to Europe,
and black populations and Middle Eastern people and so forth. And the character of Europe is changing a lot as a result. And whether you can control this
in the long run is a big question. We could be, say, in Switzerland, or in Germany, a Muslim country in 20 years time or 30 years time, it's possible.
I'm not saying, you know, as a philosophical observation, it would be difficult to say it's going to be worse than it is now. Because Spain on the Moorish
rule, say, Cordoba was the world's largest city for a while. And Granada were very important cities that were relatively free.
But if you ask the Spaniards, and you look at Spanish texts of the time, then they would dispute that it was very free. They will say, well, it was maybe free
compared to the period of Inquisition that followed. But who knows exactly how free it was?
So, I had a discussion at a recent conference with Kyle Bass where we touched on immigration, and it's such a hot button issue right now. And I don't want to
make any sort of partisan comment if I can avoid making it, but I do think that whatever your immigration policy is, it should be intentional. And to your point,
Mark, it sounds like Europe is, I think, an even worse situation in the US where we don't really have a strategy that at least I think most people can discern
right now. In Europe, whatever happens in 30 years or so, if it does become, let's use your example of Sharia law becoming so popular that it gets adopted
there, maybe that's a good thing, maybe that's a bad thing, but that's something that people should be intentionally deciding right now whether that's what
they want or not, and it doesn't seem like there's a plan in place behind Europe's current immigration policy.
Look, I'm a member of the Committee for Swiss Neutrality. We want to introduce into the
Constitution stronger words about neutrality. We refer in our present constitution to neutrality,
but it's not well defined in the sense that Switzerland in an extreme case could
join NATO. The voices in Switzerland, they want to join NATO. It's not my initiative, but I'm a member.
I strongly oppose Switzerland becoming anything else than neutral. And I don't want to go into
the subject here because it's quite complex, but basically we can do for the world much more by
being neutral than not, but we can do much more favorable things for the world
if we're neutral than if we are in the American camp or NATO camp or if we are
a close ally of China or of Russia. Do you understand? So for such a small country like Switzerland, completely
insignificant economically in the world, the best for us is to be neutral. But some people
object to that. They think we should be NATO and have the NATO army in Switzerland and so forth and so on.
So they have different views. And through this initiative, what I found out is people
are incredibly lethargic and complacent. If you go to people and tell them, look,
these are the facts about the neutrality. They all agree. You ask them to sign something,
they will not sign it. Only half the people in Switzerland vote, not usually at elections,
very few people vote. They say it's none of my business because they live in comfort.
I was going to say, this is the complacency that happens.
The salon socialists, the salon socialists are people who live in wells in the best locations,
but they themselves are socialists. They don't pay tax, they don't do,
but they are socialists. Yeah, we have that out here in California where we call them
Palo Alto socialists, where they're the people who have made ungodly amounts of money through
their tech winnings. Yes, exactly. Hollywood. Well, okay, so look, here's where I'm going with this,
which is that quote by Gary, it talks about how that creep of government control that you
mentioned, Mark, it seems to be increasing from the start of this millennium. We now have all
these geopolitical risks that are swirling around out there and they're very real risks. I mean,
it's the Ukraine-Russia war, it's the flare-up of hostilities back in the Middle East, it's the
saber-rattling with China over Taiwan. I guess two questions for you. One is which one of
those, if any, really concerns you right now? And I imagine that that is just putting more and more
pressure of the type that you're seeing in Switzerland where people are taking those risks
and trying to push for more concessions either on personal liberty or
they're just trying to drive social programs with the fear of those risks behind them.
Yes, but I'm not terribly concerned of the escalation of these conflicts at the present time
but long term I think they would escalate. The other thing I want to really stress here is in
Asia itself, the issue between Taiwan and China is not a subject of widely discussions.
I think Asians feel if left alone, it's not an issue. But the neocons in the US,
they were the ones that financed and organized the demonstrations in Hong Kong through American
NGOs. They wanted to create an embarrassment for China and the demonstrations in Hong Kong
were the first stepping stone. Now they want to embarrass China with Taiwan. The Taiwanese don't
want war. The Chinese don't want war. Nobody in Asia wants war. But the outside influence can lead
to hostilities. I think we will prevail and there will not be any war. But it is something to at
least keep in mind. By the way, if I look at the Asian geography, I would be in the middle of the
war theater because the war theater would be going from the south, from Vietnam, Thailand, the north,
into Yunnan province. We have train connections between Thailand now and China through Laos.
I do. So if this happens, you've got a dog in this fight personally.
Yeah. And the American, this is unheard of in Thailand, they're building a consulate in
Chiang Mai. I live in Chiang Mai in the north of Bangkok. They call it the mountains, but it's not
mountains hill. But the Americans are building a consulate for 250 million US dollars. It shows
the Americans have a strong interest here in the north of Thailand because of its strategic
location right in the drug center. You understand this is the golden triangle. The CIA was always
involved in the drug trade. Wow. All right. This is well documented. I'm not talking conspiracy
theories. Well documented, the CIA was involved in drug trade. Well, we have a history of that in our
own hemisphere with CIA and Latin America. Anyway, but I need to slowly go because I have to work.
All right. So look, let me wrap this up. Let me ask one last question to tie
this up in a bow. Then I'm going to ask you to tell folks more about your publication and then
we'll clock off. Thank you. So real quick, Mark, and thank you so much for giving us so much time
here. This is wonderful as always. So kind of where all this is going is there's more and
more pressure that I think is building on a lot of the social populace, at least in the west
here, where they're feeling like the government's becoming more and more constrictive. Matt Taibbi,
who was in that panel, he talked a lot about the censorship that's been going on that he
helped uncover through his work on the twitter files, which I'm sure you read about and of
course that's not the only place censorship has been happening, and so the government's
tightening grip is becoming more and more visible and that's happening at a time, as you said
earlier, where people are feeling that their personal financial prospects are diminishing.
So one can make the argument that there is the sort of social pressure cooker building,
that as people feel like more and more of their future prospects are getting more and more
diminished, that you then risk hitting some sort of boiling over point. That's sort of where I was
heading with all this and I'm just curious, what is your outlook and level of concern around that
in the major western countries? My concern about this specific question is the following.
If you look at the pattern of the republicans in America and the democrats and you look at the
pattern of European governments, one thing is striking. Government expenditures go up
under every government. They go up. The republicans want to spend on this and will go to war about this
and that, and the democrats want social programs and so forth, and in Europe it's the same.
If I'm, say, a government official, I want to get elected and I go to the people and tell them,
look, we need to solve our problems. There are three ways to solve it. We need to increase your
taxes. We need to cut your benefits and we need to retreat internationally. You think I have a
chance to get a single vote, increase your taxes, reduce your benefits? Forget it. The people,
the problem in a democracy is you have to be a liar to get elected, otherwise you have no
chance to get elected if you tell people the truth. The people don't want to hear the truth.
They want a government to perform like a magician and it's not possible.
I totally agree but you can't run a nation on lies forever, so you get to some point
where the lies catch up with you. Are we destined to hit that? That's why I say I think we will move
into the servile state. I mean I have two books here. Here he has a chapter in capitalism,
socialism and democracy. He has a chapter where he gives a speech to the economic club in New York
and he says capitalism will inevitably lead to socialism and to a totalitarian state,
essentially. And he presents his arguments. We have to talk about this another time because I
don't have now much time but it will end and maybe it will end soon and maybe the Roman empire, the
surprising thing, it lasted 600 years. In Byzantine it lasted more than a thousand years. That is the
astounding thing. But nowadays I don't think it will last this long and the democratic process
I think will be finished in say 20-30 years. Wow, okay. We're gonna have to leave it there
because I could talk to you for a whole another hour on that topic alone, Mark, so let's earmark
this to really dive deeply into this next time you come on the channel. Very quickly, beyond the
investments that you suggested earlier, are there any steps that you would recommend for the average
person who is concerned about these issues that we've been talking about? I'd say move to Thailand
but I don't know, you might be in a war theater soon so who knows. Yes, I think the most important
is to be prepared in life that whatever you enjoy enormously and wherever you are successful
you will have to deal with setbacks and I don't necessarily advocate the stoic philosophy
of essentially tolerating everything but I believe that we have to get used to the fact
that sometimes the weather will be warmer and sometimes colder and sometimes there will be
years when we make a lot of money and other years when we lose money and there will be periods of
good leaders and bad leaders. My sense is that people should reduce their expectations in order
to have a fulfilling life and not to think that everything will be instant gratification.
This would be my observation. If I could distill that down, I would say cultivate resilience
especially emotional resilience and I think that it's a big mistake for people to put every detail
of their life on Facebook and picture themselves all the time and so forth. I think I have a friend
he's a billionaire, he disappeared. Nobody knows him, nobody knows he's got money, he just
disappeared. I am in touch with him and I know him because he's a subscriber and he knows me
personally and I know him personally but other than that he doesn't want people to know what he's
done in his life. You're talking about what's called the gray man strategy which is to be as
invisible as possible basically. Yes, the best is to go and live in a small village but don't
go and show your wealth. You have to go there as a little bit stupid as an ordinary person then
nobody will be attracted to you. Well, and they'll be attracted to you for the right reasons, not for
your money. Thank you so much. I know we ran over. Thank you so much for giving us so
much of your time. Really look forward to having you back on the channel. Thank you for being my
