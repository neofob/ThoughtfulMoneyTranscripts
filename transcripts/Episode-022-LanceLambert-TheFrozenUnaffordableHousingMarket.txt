Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
While 2023 was a much better year for the financial markets, the housing market has fared less well.
Instead, 2023 was the year that gravity caught up with rising home prices.
They've stopped rising nationally for the most part, and certain once red hot cities are now starting to see clear declines.
Is this the Wile E. Coyote moment before prices start plummeting under today's high mortgage rates?
Or will the housing market prove resilient as we enter 2024?
To find out, we'll talk with real estate analyst Lance Lambert, former real estate editor for Fortune, and now co founder and editor of Resi Club.
Lance, thanks so much for joining us today.
Yeah, thank you so much for having me, Adam.
It means a lot.
Really excited to come on here and have a chat about housing.
Thanks. Really excited to have a chat about housing with you, and thank you for joining us.
I know that you've been under the weather and you're kind of coming out of that to talk to my audience.
So thank you for folks watching.
I'll give more details about this later,
but thanks to everybody who sent me such nice well wishes about my father.
Just a sad update.
He did pass away this weekend.
I know I told folks I might be away from the camera this week.
I probably won't be given that I'm now back in California.
And also, it's sort of part of my process
for dealing with adversity is just to sort of throw myself into work.
So for those that are worrying, this is more therapy for me than not.
So anyways, thank you, everybody, for your kindness and your understanding.
All right, Lance, back to the main topic here.
Housing, lots of questions for you.
It's a topic that comes up a lot on this channel, and I usually don't get that much
time to drill into it with my guests unless they're housing experts.
And I haven't had one on for a while.
And this is your first time on the channel.
And I'm really excited to get your thoughts on what's going on here.
Just to set the stage,
can you give an answer to this intentionally broad question,
which is, what is your current assessment
of the housing market, the U.S. housing market right now?
Yeah, I see the U.S. housing market in a bit of a tug of war, is how I see it.
And on one side you have a tight resale supply where the inventory,
the active inventory on the market is still thirty eight, thirty seven,
thirty nine percent below pre pandemic levels.
And so I really look at that as the balance
of the equilibrium of the market or the resale side.
So if inventory is very tight, that's going to be a tailwind for prices.
But on the other side, there is the on the other side of the tug of war is
the headwind and this headwind is the very unaffordable housing market.
Affordability levels are just very unhealthy right now.
Back in October, when the average 30 year
fixed mortgage rate briefly hit eight point zero three, as measured by Mortgage
News Daily, that put us at the worst of affordability levels in four decades.
So affordability this fall was worse than it was in like eighty three and eighty
four and a lot of these years when you had eleven, twelve percent mortgage rates.
And the reason being is that when you take
into account mortgage rates, house prices and incomes, it's just very unaffordable
right now. So you have gotten some relief
with mortgage rates coming down a bit in the 10 year coming down a bit.
But at the end of the day, this is still very unaffordable help of affordability.
So unhealthy affordability on one side and tight resale supply kind of has
a market and a bit of a stalemate.
Okay. So a bit of a stalemate right now.
I've sort of used the term like a high noon showdown.
You got buyers and sellers kind of squinting at each other
across the main street there at high noon.
Let me just ask you this.
We're going to get into the details of all of this, but let's just say current
conditions just persist, right? Which one wins out over time?
The stalemate can't last forever.
So if the status quo continues, which side breaks?
Yeah, I think it's hard.
Well, I think the truth is right now there is a bit of a stalemate with the tug
of war, and so the most logical answer is we're grinding.
So are we grinding down a little bit?
Are we grinding up?
And that's where it's really tricky to figure out.
And the difference between the two scenarios of a market that's going to
grind down on prices for a period of time, like, let's say, three, four years and a
market that's going to just grind up a little bit over three or four years is
probably a market that isn't that different.
Like the difference between the two scenarios might not be that large.
But what is interesting is that when we've seen markets just get some supply,
get active listings up just above pre pandemic levels or to pan pre pandemic
levels like Travis County, Texas, and pockets of Texas and pockets of Louisiana
and some smaller parts of Florida, we've seen prices give in.
We've seen prices weaken.
And what moved active listings up in those
markets is not that there was a ton of resale supply coming on.
Actually, Austin, which is the market down the most in the Zillow home value index,
down 19 percent for home prices is measured by the Zillow home value index.
Austin has actually seen a decline in new listings.
The number of homes coming up for sale
in market in Austin in the market there is actually down.
So how is Austin down for the number of listings?
But then inventory grew there and grew enough to get to pre pandemic levels.
Well, what happened is they had a more acute hit to demand in Austin and in
particular as people like the covid migration let up and the fact that
fundamentals in Austin were so distorted because that outside money came in during
the pandemic pushed fundamentals too far beyond local incomes.
Then mortgage rates spiked and they were just too far beyond.
So the demand shock was greater.
So the question is if some of these other
markets start to get more acute hits to demand, let's say unemployment were
to rise more than it is today and actives could grow.
Would that put us in a spot where more of the markets are seeing price declines?
And and it's a great question because on the other side, though, if that did occur,
affordability could improve some if rates were to also come down.
But I think what the data is telling us
right now is we're seeing a lot of regional bifurcation, which I'd love to
get into more, and there is definitely a vulnerability to prices falling.
OK, so bifurcation, literally my next question.
So why don't we just go there right away?
So can you define it, explain what's going on and why it's important right now?
Yeah.
So one of the things that's occurring is
that when mortgage rates went up a bunch and affordability deteriorated,
we saw across the housing market a shift in demand.
So some people weren't necessarily getting priced out altogether.
Some of them were moving down the spectrum.
So they were going from,
let's say they were going to get a seven hundred fifty thousand dollar house.
And now they're looking at four fifty or five hundred.
And so as that moves down,
you actually keep a lot of pressure on the bottom of the market.
And and then also another thing that occurs is that people who own entry level
homes, let's say somebody who bought in twenty eighteen, twenty nineteen,
they bought a two bedroom house, but now they have two kids.
Right.
And they would love to have a three bedroom.
But in this current affordability
environment, they can't they're not eligible for a mortgage for that bigger
house, so they're having both beds are staying put.
And so by them staying put and not going out and buying a bigger home,
what that is, is a net decrease in supply at the bottom of the market
and a net decrease in demand at the middle to top of the market where they would go.
And so what that's doing is it's making the bottom of the market hotter
and it's keeping the top of the market a little cooler.
And so markets where they lean more towards
a high, you know, more expensive homes like San Francisco and Seattle,
those places have been hit harder because the tops of the markets and these
higher price points have just been hit harder.
And then the markets where there's more
affordability, let's say the Scranton's of the world and places where you could
still even buy properties, the cash flow, there's they've been warmer.
There's been more competition.
And so what we've seen this year is we've
seen an increase in prices on the national level by very little.
But if you unpack it, you're still seeing
a lot of declines in these higher priced markets.
But the bottom third of the market
in the northeast and Midwest has actually been fairly hot.
Like we're talking up six to eight percent.
And that sector of the housing market is
what drove the national increase this year.
So without the bottom third of the northeast and Midwest, we wouldn't have
seen prices probably up this year, year to date for twenty twenty three.
It was just that piece of the market was so hot.
And another part that that corner of the
country saw is the doughnut effect where around a lot of these major markets,
they were no longer doing fully remote, right?
A lot of the employers, especially in the northeast, are no longer fully remote.
They've called some people back in, but they're one to two days in the office.
And so instead of people leaving New York
and San Francisco for, let's say, Boise and Austin,
we're still seeing the work from home arbitrage.
But it's more of like, OK, let's go out further into Connecticut.
Let's go out further into New Jersey.
There's a rail now going for straight from Scranton into New York City.
And so you've seen some more there.
Actually, Scranton has the most house price appreciation.
Well, it and Rochester among the markets I track.
And so you're still you're seeing some of that work from home arbitrage.
But it's changed where it's pushing up and it's no longer the Boise's and Austin's.
And now it's more of like excerpts, really far excerpts and kind of third tier,
fourth tier cities and markets.
All right, great.
And I have a question later on down here
about asking about the impact of work from home and maybe we'll still revisit that.
But it sounds like you're seeing
it is still influencing the real estate market and it's kind of still evolving.
Right. So maybe you can't go live
in the beautiful mountain town that's states away from where you were working.
So you're going to stay near your employer,
but you can get further away from your employer into a more affordable market as
long as you can get into that office for the one or two days a week.
They're asking you to get.
Yeah, and so big picture here is the housing market is so unhealthy
and affordability that buyers, when they're transacting,
are trying to do anything they can to get some relative affordability.
And so that's why the places in the parts
of the country that saw appreciation, it was that impact where it was kind
of moving down and a shifting of expectations
to different places and different types of homes.
So
let me ask you this.
This has been sort of my assessment as a non expert of the housing market
for many years.
I mean, pre the covid craziness with prices, too.
We could have had this discussion back in 2018 or 19, which is that
the home price to income ratio has just been creeping up and creeping up.
And that's what's getting just crazy right now in terms of the unaffordability index.
And what I hear you saying is
this bifurcation is basically people shifting
both of the geography and the type of home that they're looking to buy,
because it's kind of the only one that they can barely sort of make pencil out.
But I still feel like we've had
years of people really stretching to get into the home.
And a lot of people were willing to do that because homes were appreciating so
well, they just had this confidence that the home is just going to keep going up.
So I just I get in and I won't be priced out forever.
And yes, even enough to pay this ridiculous price, I can get a mortgage for it.
I can make it pencil out that I can still
like put food on the table and pay this mortgage, right?
It sounds like what I'm taking from you is people are still at that stage.
It's just that their options are more limited now.
Right.
And so people are still really stretching to get these maybe less ideal solutions.
So are we indeed is that sort of a correct assumption?
Like, are we still indeed forcing the consumer to stretch?
So you're right.
So the consumer mentally felt like they
were stretching themselves back then to buy, right?
They were kind of like
going and spending more than they thought they should.
And affordability was already an issue in their mind, right?
But with the run up in prices we saw
during covid and now the mortgage rate shock with mortgage rates going up so high
and affordability moving now to this new level, the barrier there in terms
of them stretching themselves is no longer just in their mind stretching themselves.
They are literally up against like
the debt to income rules and like lenders limits on them.
So they pushed all the way up to the limits.
And now that is like the barrier that is
like, okay, you cannot like we can only go so unaffordable within
the boundaries of the law and people still be transacting.
And I think during this past year, we've kind of gotten closer up to that.
So it's like a different type of level of unaffordability.
It sounds like even worse.
So where I'm going with this and I'll just ask the question here, which is
to me, this is not a healthy housing market.
I mean, I think it's been for a while, but I just think nationally you don't want
to have a housing market that is forcing your average home buyer to stretch
uncontrollably to get into an imperfect solution.
It's almost like they're on the plank and they've got a sword at their back, right?
It's like it's kind of their only option at this point if they want to buy.
To me, that just doesn't sound like a healthy market that if you were running
a country, you would want to have your housing market be like,
am I painting too dire a picture or is that accurate? It's a very unhealthy
housing market, and that's why, you know, people are so interested in it right now
because it feels, you know, there's some people who just feel like I can't do it.
There's there's not a path to it for them personally.
And I think if you look at affordability
and let's say people who are existing homeowners who've owned for the past
decade and, you know, they have fixed debt, it's two, three percent mortgage rates
for them, they feel, you know, housing affordability is fairly decent
for them, although some of them are getting insurance shocks
and property tax shocks now, depending on where they live.
And then in the rental market, of course,
there's some cities where it never feels affordable to rent.
But relative rents relative to incomes
aren't too bad relative to where the purchase market is.
So the biggest part of the stress in the market is people trying to go buy a home
at today's mortgage rates and today's prices relative to their incomes.
And so, you know, it's a bit of a question of, you know,
do people how many people will start to realize that, you know, rent to buy ratios
and the math for their own life, you know, they can find some of that relative
affordability now in the rental market and, you know, you know,
so it'll be interesting to see how the cycle plays out.
We're just in a place where affordability is very unhealthy for housing.
The problem is, is finding the mechanism down on price.
Right.
So you look back 15 years ago, active listings built very high.
Right.
Then there was also a tightening of credit
standards where who could get who was eligible for a house in 2008 shifted.
They changed the laws.
And so there was a credit tightening there that occurred.
And then you have the foreclosures
and the fact that unemployment moved up very quickly, very fast.
And so unemployment moving up very quickly, very fast.
That cycle completely negated all of the
benefits of mortgage rates coming down like mortgage rates coming down at the time
did nothing to help save that 2008 bubble.
But what you had is you had the mechanism and the force down on the market.
And as of today, we don't really have that right now.
And that's why we're in so much of a stalemate with some markets grinding up
still on price and some markets grinding down on price.
OK, so we have this,
I guess keep using this word stalemate, right?
But we have this sort of market in limbo right now.
And we have a lot of buyers who are at their max stretch point.
Right. We'll say.
So, you know, let's try to think of what could make prices go up or prices go.
Well, let's start with the upside first.
Like, what would it take for prices to go up here?
And I guess it would be obviously mortgages to get cheaper.
Right. And that would help.
But probably I'm going to guess.
A lot cheaper, right, because mortgage rates are pretty much
they're more than double than where they were two and a half years ago.
Right.
So if even if mortgage rates have come from down from eight to about seven now,
I think they come down to six and a half, six.
Yeah, it's getting cheaper,
but it's still almost twice what it was a few years ago.
Right. So but that would help.
Obviously, I guess some like incredibly dramatic economic growth that
resulted in faster growing wages for everybody would help.
I'm not sure that White Knight's going to ride to the rescue anytime soon.
At real scale.
Like, what are the other arguments to be made here for?
We're in a stalemate here, but things are going to start resuming again.
So I think one of the parts.
So I recently had an interview
with Sean Dobson, CEO of Amburst, and they own 44,000 single family homes.
And his view of the market is it's just very hard.
There's a lot of uncertainty to forecast right now.
But what's occurring is that the reason that we're up a little bit nationally
for prices this year is that the technicals of the market,
the fact that resale supply is so tight, that is what drove up prices in his mind.
Now, affordability is very unhealthy,
but just the fact of where the supply demand equilibrium is with existing
inventory being so low is driven up prices some.
And and I think that the markets where that's even more extreme,
like, let's say, the Hartford, Connecticut to the world, the Rochester's.
I think those markets, as we move into the spring next year,
are probably going to see prices rise until they get out of that spot.
Now, can they get out of that spot?
Yeah, you go look at Austin, where Hartford and Rochester are for supply
for active listings is where Austin was entering two thousand and twenty two.
Austin had they were down 70 percent from pre pandemic levels for active listings.
I mean, the whole greater Austin market was like two thousand three
thousand homes for sale, and now they're up to like ten, eleven thousand.
But they they had what they had occur as
the demand shock and demand finally broke, and it created just enough relief
in the market as days on market went up that inventory was able to build.
And then the prices were able to fall.
But right now there's a good chunk of the markets that are probably heading into
next year, going to probably see price appreciation through the seasonally strong
period until something can occur that breaks the technicals of the market
in a different way. OK, so it seems like so much of what is
propping the national housing fleet up is this super tight, tight inventory.
And there have been lots of narratives of, oh, U.S.
housing is super underbuilt and we just have chronically low inventory.
I've heard arguments made on both sides of that.
I think one of the things that's keeping
inventory so low, you mentioned earlier, is the fact that, what is it?
It's
only a tiny fraction of U.S.
homeowners right now have negative equity in their house because the house is
appreciated so much and they're sitting on, many of them are sitting on those low
interest rates, right?
But they're kind of trapped in their homes right now, right?
Like they probably some material percentage of them would like to move,
but when they look at what they're going to get
for their money if they move, you know, in many cases it's a worse scenario, right?
They're going to get rid of this very low mortgage and they're going to buy a house
that maybe not even be as nice of a house, but have to pay a lot more for it, right?
So I guess my question is, what is the true status of inventory here?
Yes, the transactions are currently tight
right now, but is there a lot of inventory that could hit this market?
Say if prices start going down in Austin, maybe actually showing us this, right?
It looked like a super tight market.
Then all of a sudden there's a lot more inventory there.
And yes, that was one of the markets
where developers were building more aggressively in.
But you have that. But then there are vacant homes out there.
There are second homes.
You know, we'll talk maybe about short term rentals a little bit.
But like as some of those,
the inventory of that market maybe starts being a negative cash flow.
You might start seeing those guys start dumping inventory on market.
At some point, we'll talk about the institutional buyers as well.
Is inventory really chronically tight?
And it's just something that America is
going to have to take years to get into balance.
Or is there inventory that could come
onto the market quite quickly, given other dynamics?
Well, so I think the structural supply
discussion, I think is a bit different from the discussion
of can a market have a correction like so, you know, I think there's a good
possibility that, you know, a lot of these analyses are right and that the U.S.
has, you know, you know, not enough housing units.
But that didn't stop Austin from having a correction like it could be true that we
could have a shortage of homes and still have corrections of housing markets where
the fundamentals just went too far during the pandemic housing boom.
And if there's an opening,
because affordability so deteriorated that we have a correction, right,
regardless of if there's enough housing units,
because it's possible that the housing
units that we have have just gotten priced too high.
Right.
And so Austin had a correction in Austin.
Probably you can make an argument is still,
you know, structurally short on homes,
but they just got priced way too far above local fundamentals.
And so Austin was able to have this
correction because days on market shot up really fast and pretty much just
the what was pushing prices up was the inventory was low.
And so inventory staying low just kept pushing it up and it was overheating.
But as soon as the it got break checked and days on market was able to increase,
then they were able to just build with some of the actives.
And so it's possible because what you've
seen now is a few more markets that didn't go into correction right away last year
are now seeing correction this year, like New Orleans.
New Orleans is now down 13 percent from peak in the Zillow Home Value Index.
And what occurred there was not a ton of listings coming on the market,
but just demand pulled back.
I don't know if it's because of home insurance increases in Louisiana.
I don't know if it's things about like the push against short term rentals,
but whatever it is, they've seen the active listings grow,
grow closer to pre pandemic levels and then prices softened.
It's the problem is that housing economics is not an exact science.
And a lot of people pretend it is.
And, you know, we know exactly where house prices are going.
But the truth is, it's not it's an exact science, but every cycle gives you clues.
And I also think it's important to pay attention to what drove the prices up
because that can give clues to the back end if there could be some relief.
So last cycle, a lot of what drove up the increase.
Is, you know, the mortgage products, right?
There was, you know, a loose the looser lending standards and some
of those mortgage products helped to generate more existing home sale volume.
People got into some of these products with like the teaser rates and all of that.
And, you know, as interest rates moved up and they had to refi, they were in trouble.
And you're talking early 2000s right there, right?
Yeah. What helped? Yeah.
So so the thing I'm getting to there is what helped to bring the market up was
the same thing that helped to bring the market down.
This cycle was very different in that when the pandemic housing boom,
when the lockdowns occurred, what happened is that there was an
acceleration in housing demand, housing demand took off.
And what occurred is there was an increase in demand for space.
And it wasn't just the people who were going to work from home.
So, you know, I was at Fortune at the time.
And when I left Fortune's office and went
down the elevator and they'd sent us home for a week, I knew that day I was like,
you know what, I'm probably going to move home.
My wife and I are both from Cincinnati and we're going to build a house.
That was the first thing I thought of was, you know, I'm done living in New York.
I've been there five years, was never going to own a home in New York.
And if I was, I was going to have to move out really far.
And I was like, you know what, I'm moving back to family.
Everybody, this is going to be remote.
I'm going to show I can do my job and get out of here.
But you saw so it wasn't just that effect.
It was also the people who stayed in a lot
of these cities and who were like sick of living with their roommates.
They're like, you know what, I'm not going into the office.
I got to work from home.
And this roommate I have, I don't like him as much as I thought.
When I was around him, one to two hours a day was fine.
But this 10 hours, I'm done with them.
And you saw people who had like two bedroom homes or two bedroom apartments.
The now both of them were working from home.
They wanted more space.
And so that helped to drive up home prices,
even in markets like San Francisco and center up.
But on top of that is all the stimulus that went out there.
I'm getting that to you had an increase, an increase in demand for space.
You had work from home arbitrage, where you could go into a more affordable
market and buy more real estate than you had in your current market.
And then you also had the stimulus money and record low rates put on top of it.
And so the Fed estimates that housing demand increased.
That housing supply would have needed to increase 300 percent during the first two
years of the pandemic to match the elevation and housing demand.
And so the elevated housing demand never was fulfilled.
What but what it did is it overpiled on the supply and overheated the prices.
So the amount of the housing demand that was actually out there to buy,
like if you actually included everybody out there trying to buy rentals
and everything that was on the market or everything that was chasing homes in 2021
into spring 2022, they just they just couldn't get in.
And so prices overheated.
But the reason I'm going there is if you actually had a.
Sharp pullback in the work from home effect.
And that were to contract right now, we've seen some return to the office
and some of that, but you haven't actually seen work from home considerably correct.
It's still up six fold from where it was in spring 2020.
And if that were to occur, then I think that would be
that could create a cascading correction that we're not really talking about and
thinking about that would hit it all the places that benefited from that boom.
OK, definitely a big factor, and that's one of the ones I was going to get to.
So we talked earlier about what could could tell the story of higher prices.
I think the list is longer for what could
be driving prices lower, and certainly a huge one is just employment.
Right. I mean, if we were to fall into a recession that had
substantial layoffs like we've seen in some of the past couple of recessions,
hundreds of thousands of people getting laid off
per month, I assume that would really change the picture, whether or not they're
being called back to the office or they're just being told,
no, don't come back to the office because we're we're laying you off.
Yeah, I think it's a great question.
You go back and you look at the past few cycles.
And in the early 2000s, that recession,
which unemployment moved up, but mortgage rates moved down.
And that one you had seen home prices.
Actually, that was actually around the time the home price boom started.
And we were up actually double digits in the year of the recession that year.
Then you go to the next recession,
the great financial crisis, of course, housing prices tanked.
And that was the worst ever national correction for home prices
and very unique cycle of the post World War Two era.
And then you have covid, which is a very brief recession.
But you had also seen a record stimulus, the onset of the work from home effect,
and then two percent mortgage rates in the home prices boomed.
I think whatever this cycle is, if we had a recession, I don't think it would be
either of those three cycles, which two of those were housing booms.
And one of those was a historic housing crash.
I think its own unique cycle.
And it could actually be a cycle where
there's a good amount of bifurcation in the market, especially if it had
what I was discussing just before, which is a correction to work from home
that would benefit some markets and then that would actually and then,
of course, negatively impact others and real estate.
Super local location, location, location,
both in the property and in the the city that you live in.
So that will always continue to hold true here.
But
let me just ask you a couple of questions to get a sense for
how material these factors could be.
One I mentioned earlier that
right now you've got a lot of people who are homeowners who are sitting on equity
and who have a low mortgage rate.
So I imagine most of them are just trying to play the weight game here.
Right. Let's let's let's wait until prices,
until some mortgage rates come back down and that'll hopefully push the price
of my house up even more, but it'll also make it easier for me
to to sell and go buy somewhere else. Right.
And we do have the vast majority, I said the vast majority,
but a material amount of those homeowners are boomers.
Right.
And actually they some of them, not a small percentage, own multiple homes.
They got their main home, they got a second home, whatever.
But but for a lot of people,
they're a lot of older people, you know, their retirement,
like their home equity is a big part of their retirement.
Right.
So if we got into a situation where home prices started coming down from here,
right, maybe because of rising unemployment or whatever factor.
Right.
But if they start seeing their home equity going down and thinking like,
that's what I've got to rely on from here.
Could that be a prompt to like trigger a wave of selling here as people start
saying, well, look, I don't I don't want to be the idiot that holds on too long.
I want to get out sooner.
Maybe maybe I'll price to sell just a little bit below the market and I'll get
95 percent of what remains of my home equity and I'll go rent or do something
else, but I'll have that at least if I'm worried that the housing market could go
down substantially further, like could we start this domino effect of sellers
trying to scramble out? You know, I'm not 100 percent sure.
It's a tough question.
And it's, you know, the boomer thing in general is just something very
interesting to kind of figure out the next not just three years or five years,
but really 10, 15 years, like how all of that plays out.
Please take it there, because I've got a question about that, too.
So let's go.
That's a really hard question to answer,
because right now I'm laser focused on like this cycle.
And how do we just get to a place where
affordability is a little closer to historic norms and kind of what gets us
there? But I think on the boomer side, the fact is there's just not a ton of stress
on that end of the market and they are actually probably a part of what's been
a tailwind for the market that we've been in now, especially with so many of them
having, you know, you know, not having a mortgage like their mortgage free high
equity. Okay.
But they're not stressed yet because prices haven't been coming down yet.
Maybe they'll start sweating if that reverses.
But anyways, keep going. Yeah.
So
it'll be, you know, one of the things I'm interested to know is you've seen a lot
of these retirement places because the boomers are such a big generation.
They were very wealthy.
They went out and bought a lot of real estate as they retired.
And, you know, and we've seen a lot of places, especially in the,
you know, around Florida and parts of the South have really moved up a lot in prices.
So one thing I'm really interested to know is where does the next generation retire?
Are they going to go to the places that the boomers just made very unaffordable?
Are they going to be picking like new pockets?
And
that's an interesting question that I don't see getting asked a lot,
which is, are Gen Xers going to retire to the same place as the boomers did?
Because there is the negative impact that the boomers just made.
This place is all very unaffordable.
Well, OK, so let's even precede that, right.
Which is
first,
you know, a lot of Gen X, like who are the boomers going to sell their homes to?
Right. Like they've
pushed this whole McMansion strategy.
And we've sort of seen this disinterest in that from these younger
generations, one, because they just, in most cases, can't afford them.
Right. And they're looking at more like
modest size homes or tiny homes or whatever, like they just don't have a huge
aspiration to be purchasing this 6,000 plus square foot place that has lots
of maintenance costs and stuff associated with it.
So that's an interesting question, I think, of just like
they don't have the ability to afford it, nor necessarily the desire to own it.
So that's one big question, which is the boomers going to be able to
sell their current fleet of inventory to enough willing buyers?
Maybe not. Right.
But
so here's the big question I have around this, which is well, actually, sorry, two.
One is you talked about how boomers have bought a fair amount of real estate,
like the affluent boomers oftentimes own more than one property.
Right.
And one of the things that had happened was, you know, boomers are getting older
and they tend to downsize as they get older.
What I've heard, and I'd love for you to corroborate if this is true, is that
if they do, they are often not actually selling their larger house.
They were renting it out because it was
a source of cash flow and it was like a stock in their portfolio.
Oh, it goes up every year.
So why would I want to get rid of that asset?
It's going it's appreciating and paying me a cash flow.
Right.
So if a boomer gets into any sort of, you know, an economic pinch
because the economy is slowing or just their own personal situation,
you would think the first thing to go would be that extra house.
Right. Like, oh, well, I'm not living in it.
You know, it's not an essential asset to me.
I'll just dump it. Right.
Is there a potential for that phenomenon to happen?
Well, so one thing that I think is probably going to be true is that if we
don't see a period where affordability meaningfully corrects, right.
Whether that's through a bigger decline in mortgage rates or it's, you know,
income surprise to the upside or prices come down more than expected,
or all three are really working together to improve affordability.
If we don't see that, then the housing market is probably going to be in a place
where on a regional basis, we're going to be vulnerable to different types
of corrections that we otherwise wouldn't have been.
And so could one of those be through
the mechanism that you're kind of discussing here potentially?
And, you know, we were in this place before in the 80s.
We saw in the 70s and into the 80s, we had seen home prices boom a lot.
And then we had seen mortgage rates go up a lot and they came down some.
But affordability was very strained through the 80s.
Well, what occurred in the mid 80s is that there was an oil bust in Texas,
the SNL crisis.
And so what we saw is a home price correction through a lot of the markets
in parts of the south and a lot of Texas, of course, was the epicenter.
You know, Austin, I went back and checked the numbers.
It was down like 30 percent almost peak
to trough, which is bigger than the national decline for the crash.
And I think a lot of the vulnerability there was that
affordability was just very strained coming out of the 70s in the 80s.
And could we be in a similar situation where we don't get a meaningful
correction here in the next few years for housing?
But it puts us in a place where
some economic events occur and create regional corrections that otherwise
wouldn't have occurred, I think that might be a possibility.
OK, I've got a couple other like what ifs that I want to get to,
but while we're on this topic of sort of boomers and affordability,
let me ask you this sort of much larger question.
And I had a really interesting discussion with Ivy Zellman on this recently, which
is, you know, 10,000 baby boomers hit retirement age every day, right?
At some point in the next 10 to 15 years,
that's going to be 10,000 baby boomers go to the nursing home or pass away, right?
So you're going to have, presumably,
kind of a downward selling pressure for a prolonged period of time,
at least in the housing stock that is currently boomer owned,
where there's just you're going to have these forced transactions.
Now, put yourself in the mind of an aspiring younger buyer at today's prices,
right, and you're thinking, all right,
I'm going to buy a 30 year mortgage on this house and kind of making a 30 year
commitment here. I mean, obviously you don't have to own the whole time,
but like I'm going to buy this asset that I'm going to be paying off for the next
30 years, but halfway on the way to paying it off,
there's going to be this this headwind, increasing headwind of downward pressure
in housing because of these boomer sales.
Like I know most aspiring home buyers probably don't think that far ahead
about these type of issues, but it does beg the question,
why would I be stretching to buy
this asset if halfway through my tenure
of holding it, it could very well go down for this reason?
Yeah, it's a great question.
I think it's, you know,
you could potentially go through a prolonged period like that.
And, you know, even if it's downward pressure, it could be a situation where it
doesn't necessarily cause housing prices nationally to move down a lot,
but instead creates a window where incomes rise faster than house prices
for a prolonged period, which is what we saw in the 90s.
I think, you know,
a lot of people would probably love to see a replay of the 90s because while it
didn't see prices come down a lot, it's all very tame house price growth
through the 90s relative to how strong the economy was and how much incomes went up
and affordability improved through a lot of the 90s.
And so, you know, it's a it's a hard one
for me to answer the the the demographic play out of how the, you know, the boomer
I and I don't want to sound cold saying it like roll off, but
you know, how how the demographic shifts of the country occur and how that plays
out long term, it's it's really hard to tell.
And especially when you have unexpected
events like where it causes an overheating of house prices because of the policies
and work from home policies and the stimulus policies and QE policies and all
of that, and just that huge overheating that happened very quickly and unexpectedly.
Things like that also make it really hard to project out long term for housing.
OK, so tricky, but I'm just curious, is it something that concerns you?
Um, you know, I'm a homeowner and it's
not necessarily something that's keeping keeping me up at night.
I think the the bigger thing is just the short term, which is
is this economy actually going to pull off the soft landing that is now
it seems like the, you know, the biggest talking heads now.
It's like presumed here.
And, you know, you know, they talk about it as if it's already occurred.
And so does that actually occur or does
labor, you know, break unexpectedly?
And how do we kind of move through the short term here?
That's what I'm most interested in,
because the labor side of it, that's outside of my wheelhouse.
But that matters a lot for my wheelhouse, if that makes sense.
Absolutely.
And so that's where a lot of my headspace is just kind of like watching how that
side plays out and I don't have a big opinion one way or the other.
OK, well, we're going to get to your
outlook for housing in just a moment here, and I do want to give a little preview.
I just like an hour before sitting down
with you here, Lance, I interviewed Michael Howell,
who I'll just say if his predictions come true, he'll be your best buddy.
He he is actually remarkably optimistic
about where both the markets and the economy are headed over the next couple
of years, and it all has to do with liquidity.
And that interview is going to release a couple of days after this one, Lance.
So folks, if you're watching this video with Lance the day that it comes out,
keep your eyes peeled for the next couple of days for that Michael Howell one to come out.
But yeah, if you're if you're hoping for
housing to go back up, cross your fingers that Michael's predictions are correct.
But before we get to your housing outlook, Lance,
just your thoughts on two other factors that are going on in housing,
which I think are different in the cycle versus previous ones.
So first, we've had the explosion of short term rental,
short term rentals and, you know, during covid, right?
I mean, it seemed like everybody who could get two nickels was
leveraging them to try to buy property to then rent an Airbnb.
That boom in Airbnb purchases,
I believe, has substantially subsided, though correct me if that's a wrong statement.
And I think to me, that sort of smells like sort of like one of those
late cycle things in housing and a housing bubble where
everybody finds the easy way to get rich and you get all these newbie investors
piling in who don't really understand the economics or have never done this before
and they pay way too much and they probably get more financing terms.
And then the worm turns and their dreams of a property that was going to be
kicking off riches for them all of a sudden turns into a hemorrhaging,
a cash hemorrhaging asset.
And of course, we've seen localities start to turn against their B&Bs
because they're turning neighborhoods into party zones and stuff like that.
So how big of a factor is the short term rental phenomenon to what you expect to
happen from here in housing? Yeah.
So I'm kind of in the camp where I think for the national housing market,
I don't think it's a huge driver one way or the other for the national
total housing market, but on a regional level, it is significant.
And there's a lot of housing markets already where they've seen corrections
in the short term rental space and they've seen a lot of short term rentals
not sell anywhere near their peak values.
And so there are short term rental corrections occurring and it's occurring.
And those sub markets are falling despite
national prices kind of holding steady or even moving up a little bit.
And what we saw is that during the pandemic,
of course, people couldn't go on cruises, they couldn't go on international travel
and they were working from home and had more demand for space.
Short term rentals took off. Right.
And so the demand for short term rentals moved off very quickly.
Of course, it was a stimulated economy.
And so the rates for short term rentals rose, right?
At the same time, a lot of people wanted
to buy short term rentals because home prices were moving up quickly.
We were in a housing boom.
Mortgage rates were very low.
And they saw all these people they knew
making tons of money hand over fist with Airbnbs, so they wanted to get in.
Well, that increased the supply of Airbnbs heading into last year
and also into this year as they kind of came onto the market.
And as that occurred, you saw a pullback in the demand for short term rentals.
International travel came back, cruises came back.
Some people who were
traveling around the country at Airbnbs now had to go back into the office.
So we saw some of that demand come down.
We saw the supply of short term rentals move up.
And so what that creates is a correction.
And we've been through this place where
some of these Airbnb owners have had to decide
am I going to keep my rates and just not
make anywhere near the monthly revenue I did before or move down my daily rates?
And so a lot of them have moved down their daily rates.
Some who aren't cash flowing, how they thought have had to sell.
Some have just moved them into long term rentals.
But we have seen some correction in the short term rental space.
I think it gets I think the potential for it creating a huge cascading effect
through the national market probably gets overplayed.
But I think some of the people who are very bullish on housing have probably
overlooked this correction that's already been occurring just because they don't
really know how to like measure down to the local level, which when you cut the
data at a local level, you can see it is there in some of these sub markets.
But it all is based on the local
short term rental economics and how fast demand has pulled back and how much supply
has actually come on in the short term rental space.
OK, part of the reason why I'm sort of digging into some of these things is
housing is priced at the margin.
Right. So one house in the neighborhood can reset
stops for the entire neighborhood. Right.
So if you have these new sources of inventory that we just don't have that
much of or haven't had that much of recently start to come on the market, it
can
it can impact everybody.
Now, of course, short term rentals, not every market experienced the same short
term rental boom. So it's probably going to be in those areas where they were
overbought. And to your point, where demand is suddenly cooled off,
the most is where you'll probably see this impact the most.
Yeah, I think that's right.
And I think that whole idea of prices set on the margin is very important.
And I think that's depending on where that person has fallen.
That's why some of these markets are down and some of them are up.
Do you have a second for me to share a map?
Absolutely. Please do.
So we hear a lot about U.S.
home prices as measured by like the Zillow home value index being up to three percent
for the year. That's true.
Here's what it looks like when you look at the county map for the whole country.
This is year over year.
It is
it's through October.
I do have data through November, but it looks very similar either way.
But what you will see is that there's a good amount of weakness in Mississippi,
Louisiana.
I mean, let's see here.
Yes, double digits down now, you you have some weakness through there.
And then Texas, of course, there's Travis County down 15 percent.
That's where Austin is.
And then, of course, a lot of these places that were, you know, Zoom towns during the
pandemic, you've now seen prices come down some.
You've seen softening up in the Seattle area.
Northern California has seen a lot more than Southern California.
Southern California actually recovered a
good amount this year relative to the correction last year.
And then Florida is very interesting where Miami-Dade and southern Florida had been
fairly strong, but the western coast, especially like Cape
Coral and Sarasota, have been much softer.
And then as you move up the country, you start to see this like Wisconsin,
Illinois, all the way over to Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts,
much stronger and that everything above North Carolina, really other than a patch
of like West Virginia, much stronger, that has kind of pushed up prices.
But this is not what prices usually look
like year over year, back in like twenty seventeen or twenty eighteen or twenty
nineteen, you've definitely seen some price give up.
Even if on the national level, prices are still moving up.
But at the same time, you have pockets of
Wisconsin and Connecticut where inventory is still down seventy five,
eighty percent from pre pandemic levels and prices just because the technicals
are where they are pushed up more this year.
Got it. But yeah, this chart is an important one for the point of the
marginal buyer, which is, you know, you'll hear something like home prices are up
nationally by X percent, but this is really telling a tale of two different
Americas, right? I mean, roughly half of the counties here are down and half of
them are up and it all depends upon what's going on in those regional markets.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, there's a lot and that's why I use that word bifurcation a lot.
There's a lot of bifurcation happening in housing right now.
OK, we're running out of time and I do want to get to your housing outlook.
I was going to ask you about the new home market versus the the existing home market.
If there's anything you want to say about that, please do.
But the last question I want to sneak in before we get to your your outlook is.
Institutional ownership of single family
homes, because that is another thing that is new about this cycle.
And
I've not been shy about sort of my my personal opinion on
having too much of your your national
residential housing stock owned by corporations.
We can put that aside for a second from like an ethical standpoint.
But just from an economic standpoint,
obviously that was helping push prices higher as you had these deep pocketed
purchasers who could actually borrow at lower rates than the average person out
there and snapping up a lot of inventory with all cash offers.
But there's also the risk, too,
if they ever get in trouble, these companies own lots of properties,
oftentimes lots of properties in the same geography.
And let's say you just have a hedge fund that gets in real trouble and they've got
to dump their their portfolio and they can't easily find another buyer who's going
to pick it all up, there's in theory, at least the risk that they could dump a lot
of inventory in a market all at once and really surprise people and depress prices.
Anyways, what are your thoughts about the institutional ownership?
Yeah, so I left Fortune where I've been
the editor, the real estate editor for a few years
and really covered a lot of housing to build Resi Club.
And my coverage really falls into four buckets.
One, I really want to cover well, regional housing market analytics,
get a lot of this regional housing market data out there.
The other one is homebuilders and then prop techs and real estate startups.
And then fourth, and this is the one actually I've been
covering the most, especially relative to the builders in the real estate startups,
is these institutional homebuyers, because I want to have a really good
I think if people want to find a lot of great information on real estate,
on the institutional side, especially what they're doing in single family, you can't.
There's not like a great media publication
that's covering it very closely until now.
So Resi Club, we've really dived in and we're not just tracking
one or two institutional buyers, we're tracking the biggest,
most of them, most of the ones that have at least a thousand homes.
We're tracking closely, not just to see what they're buying,
but also what they're selling, where they're selling, where they're buying.
And what we've seen is that on the institutional side,
there was a very big uptick in institutional home buying levels.
These big SFR operators that own at least
a thousand homes in Q2 2022 at the height, they were buying 2.2 percent of all the
whole, they were 2.2 percent of all the transactions that quarter.
Now, as this perfect storm of low rates, easy access to capital,
soaring rents, soaring home prices, as that pulled back and rates moved up,
we saw a pullback in the institutional home buying levels.
And so in this latest quarter, according
to John Burns Real Estate and Consulting,
institutional SFR operators were only 0.4 percent of transactions.
So the overall pie of U.S.
housing transactions went down and then within that pie,
the institutional side has become even a smaller share right now.
And when you break out the numbers,
some of them are still kind of out there dabbling and buying a little bit.
And then you have some that while there's not a big sell off occurring,
they're seeing some sell off.
And one of those is Vinebrook, which has like 500 homes for sale now.
And when you look very closely at where
they're selling, there's some pockets and some zip codes where they're over 20
percent of listings on the market and prices in those zip codes are falling.
And I think that's pretty interesting that they're having markdowns of like 15,
20 percent in some of those zip codes, including a pretty big sell off in the Jackson,
Mississippi market, which has been one of the markets that's
correcting right now that doesn't get talked about as much as like a place like Austin.
Okay, so
it sounds like there's a risk factor here.
We're seeing it in certain markets like you're talking about, but maybe not a huge
market, especially because it sounds like you said they're kind of taking themselves
out of the game a fair amount as the economics have gotten less favorable.
I think the institutional side is just like the short term rental side,
where they're not a huge amount of the housing market,
but at the margin they can have an impact.
And if that market happens to be a place where they just spend short term rentals,
well, that can have a more acute impact on the market short term.
If it's a market where a big SFR operator
that owns a lot of homes in that particular zip code, because when they buy
in a market, they tend to concentrate within a market into a subsection of the market.
If that operator decides to pull back from that market and suddenly those
listings have to go up for sale, that can have more of an acute impact on that market.
Now, when you aggregate it all up and how
that impacts the national housing market, that's when the discussion becomes
a bit different. But on a regional market and a sub market level,
they can have an impact. It's material.
Okay. Well, look, Lance, I really enjoyed this conversation and the door is open
for you to come back on the program again in the future anytime you want.
I would actually love, given the fact
that you've really been digging into the institutional buyer side,
next time we talk, I'd love to dedicate more time to really dig into that.
Not just in terms of the housing, the wise,
but also kind of that bigger question I raised of like,
is it something that we want ideally?
And we talked earlier about, is this a healthy housing market or not?
If you have a substantial part of the transactions being driven by these
deep pocketed buyers that can kind of push regular people out of the market,
is that a healthy housing market?
I know it's probably a very nuanced answer,
and I'm curious if I can unfairly just ask you right before we move on to your
general housing outlook, on a net basis, do you think it's a good or a bad thing?
I really want to stay away from having too big of an opinion on some
of these different areas of housing, especially when I'm saying with the
institutional side, hey, guys, I'm going to be the person who comes in here and
covers it, really turns over the rocks and really figures out what's going on.
And I think if I'm going to be the person who does that,
I got to be careful to not say that's one of the areas of housing that I need to be.
And I think because, you know, really,
I think this country does need somebody who's out there asking big questions
and trying to figure out what's going on in the space and doing it through
an analytical lens. And so I want to be as fair as possible on it.
Okay. And that's very, very understandable and fair.
So I appreciate you clarifying that.
Because if I don't, somebody could use that to discredit all of my work.
Exactly. Or just not share information with you, which makes it harder for you
to get a true accurate sense of what's going on and then report it to the rest of us.
Okay. Lastly,
we're here at the end of 2023.
We're looking into 2024.
What do you see as you look ahead for the next year for housing?
Yeah. Can I share my screen again?
Absolutely.
So I'm going to shy away from making like
a national prediction for prices or a national prediction for mortgage rates.
But I will make a regional prediction,
which is I expect a good amount of bifurcation in the market.
This is inventory levels
in November compared to November 2019.
And the markets that are dark, dark brown are the places where inventory is still
very far below pre pandemic levels, the grain is now at pre pandemic.
And if it's dark green, actually, it's well above pre pandemic.
And what we have seen over the past year is a great deal of bifurcation in the
country and the thing that's always been the leading indicator for prices this
cycle, whether it's been up or down, and this is across regions,
is the active listings. And so my prediction is that a lot of pockets
of Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia,
Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Vermont,
New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut are probably going to see fairly
that they're going to see some appreciation this spring,
unless things shifted dramatically with
mortgage rates and some crazy way up or if unemployment really broke quickly.
But if if all else today we enter the spring like this,
the technicals of the market will probably push prices up
from Wisconsin, Illinois to the east because inventory is so tight.
Yeah, so tight.
And what I also expect is parts of Texas and some parts of the Gulf and maybe even
some parts of Florida will probably see some softening on the price side.
And if some of those markets only go up, like, let's say one percent or one and a
half percent in the spring, that's a good telltale sign.
And that's what I told people this year.
People are like, oh, Austin is bottomed.
It's had some month over month increases and like March two thousand and twenty
three or April two thousand twenty three.
But I looked at the trend line relative
to Austin's history and it looked like a market that was in correction.
Still, actually, Austin for twenty twenty three, the spring appreciation was the
exact same amount that Austin saw in 2008 and then it went into correction in the
second half of the year and it did so in twenty twenty three to a similar amount
that it saw in two thousand and eight for Austin, which was a market that didn't get
hit as hard in 2008 to which is something important to point out.
But I think the technicals will probably
see softer appreciation in the spring and parts of Texas in the Gulf,
and that could suggest more price correction in the second half of next year.
All I was being.
OK, so what I take from what you're saying, Lance, is that you kind of see current
trends continuing, persisting for quite a while.
So if you're in a market that inventory has increased and prices to start
softening, that's probably what's going to happen.
If you're in some of the other markets like Wisconsin, Illinois,
New England, where things are tight, as long as they remain tight,
prices probably still going to be supported there.
And of course, you're saying, look,
if something material changes, you know, like.
A recession or job loss or whatever, yeah, that could that could shift things,
but right now you see sort of whichever market you're in, whatever its current
trajectory is probably going to continue for the foreseeable part of heading into
twenty twenty four.
If you're in a market where inventory is very tight and it doesn't change
the next several months, you're probably going to see appreciation.
Yeah, but what can occur is is that markets can switch categories.
So we saw that last year where a lot of Southern California had given up on prices
in the second half of twenty twenty two and then a market like Phoenix as well.
But they tightened up and Las Vegas tightened up this year, too,
and they stabilized a lot. But then you look at a market like New
Orleans, which was not in the correction pack in twenty twenty two.
And then this year inventory moved up fairly quickly.
It got back to pre pandemic levels.
And then as we moved into the second half
of the year, the seasonally weaker period, it saw price give up.
But both ways for both categories, still inventory was the leading factor there,
which if somebody wants to see that chart, I do make that regularly
for my Resi Club program. So Resi Club, anybody can sign up,
get the free daily newsletter, and then I have a deeper newsletter,
Resi Club Pro, which is my premium product, which has more of the deeper analytics.
All right. We are taking it exactly where I was going to now landing things here
because I've kept you past the hour.
Thank you, by the way, Lance, for giving such a great discussion here.
The question I normally ask is, where can folks who have really enjoyed
this conversation go to learn more about you and your work?
Seems like Resi Club is the right place for them to go.
So Resi Club Analytics is the website.
And you can also find me on Twitter at News Lambert.
OK, and just real quick, give folks a sense of if they go to Resi Club,
what are they going to find there?
You're going to find stories about home builders.
You're going to find stories about home prices down to a regional level.
You're going to find stories about inventory and inventory to a regional level.
If something really if a Fed president comes out and says something really
important, I'll do a piece on it and get the quotes and the context.
And, you know, any big shifts in the housing market, it's covered there.
And then I also have interviews
with executives throughout the space, whether it's KB Home CEO or Amherst CEO.
And then I do stories on new companies
in the space like, you know, Rome is a new company where you go to their website and
you can find out if a home for sale today has an assumeable mortgage.
And so some of these homes for sale
on the market have two, three percent mortgage rates.
And you could assume them if they're a USDA loan, a VA loan or an FHA loan.
But you have to know if they have that loan.
Right. And so their website,
they go out and collect a lot of proprietary data and figure out what homes
for sale currently have assumeable mortgages.
So stuff like that and kind of telling
readers what's going on in the market and what's available today.
All right. Fantastic.

Lance, as we wrap up here, I've got one last question for you.
It's one I've been asking to folks
recently, and the audience has really appreciated it, which is
we just spent the past hour talking about
housing and really things that are related to financial wealth.
What's a non-financial investment
that you would recommend the audience here consider adopting?
Most important is always time with the people around you,
like close family members, close friends,
making sure that you treat those relationships and you invest into those
relationships, because I think that has a lot of impact
in the value of your life and your happiness, which, of course,
impacts everything. So I think investing also in relationships.
I can't agree more, sadly, given my family's news over the weekend,
losing my father, a huge reminder of the importance, both of relationships,
but of maximizing the time you have because you don't necessarily know
how much time you've got with everybody in your life.
And you certainly don't want to be
regretting discussions not had or time not spent once folks are out of your life
like that. So I can't agree more.
My wife, who's a
marriage family therapist,
would put your answer at the top of her list to there, Lance.
So great answer. Thanks so much.
Lance, really appreciate you being on here.
It's been a great discussion. Thank you for coming on the channel.
This is your first appearance, first time us having talked.
Really look forward to having you come
back on in the future when you've got an update to your outlook there.
Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
