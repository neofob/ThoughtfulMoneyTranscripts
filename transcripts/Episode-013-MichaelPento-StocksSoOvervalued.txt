Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
Like many, today's guest was quite concerned
entering twenty twenty three that a recession was all but inevitable,
but it never showed up.
As the year nears its end and a new one
ready to begin, did we indeed dodge a bullet
or has the recession only been delayed now ready to make landfall in 2024,
perhaps with even stronger destructive force than had it arrived sooner?
For answers, we turn to the highly popular
and always informed money manager and macro analyst Michael Pinto.
Michael, my friend, thank you so much for joining us today.
Thank you for having me, Adam.
And I just want to start off by saying
congratulations to you for the start of Thoughtful Money.
I think it's going to be way bigger than your previous venture.
So congratulations again.
I want to start off by saying that I don't believe the hype
from the mainstream financial media.
There will be no soft economic landing.
And we are not in a bull market now.
And we're not going to be in a bull market next year.
Let's just go over some facts, OK?
The bull market ended in late 2021,
and the S&P 500 is still down four percent.
That's in nominal terms, Adam.
Four percent since it's peaked in November of 2021.
And when you of course, when you inflation adjust those numbers, it's much worse.
And of course, that includes the seven mega cap
tech stocks that are solely responsible for boosting the index.
So you have basically seven A.I. stocks.
They are up 80 percent in 2023.
The other four hundred and ninety three stocks are up four percent
this year for just four lousy percent.
And that's being after being down 20 percent in 2022.
But you listen to like CNBC and you think, oh, my God,
there's this massive bull market that I'm missing out on.
It's just not true.
They're also trying to convince you
that two thousand and twenty four is going to be a very soft, cushy landing.
They're they're wrong on both counts.
Let's go through some more numbers.
The Russell 2000 is down twenty seven percent.
That's two thousand.
That's not the Dow 30.
The Nasdaq one hundred two thousand stocks in the Russell 2000.
Twenty seven percent since November of 2021.
And the 60/40 portfolio, which includes bonds, it's even worse.
If you look at the benchmark Treasury, long duration,
middle of the curve and longer, that is down 40 percent since 2022.
So the worst is ahead because the salient issues
have not been resolved.
And what are the salient issues?
The salient problem all stems from this.
We had a sub one percent interest rate fed funds rate
for 11 of the 14 years from 2008 to 2022.
And what did that do?
That led to a massive amount of debt
to be accumulated, an unserviceable amount of debt,
especially under a normal interest rate regime.
And it also led to unsustainable levels of asset bubbles.
And those things, they haven't gotten better.
They've gotten worse.
So a crash landing is still coming.
The timing for that is crucial.
And I will use my IDEC model for that timing.
I have not been net short in my portfolio
for the entire duration of 2023. Not one day.
I expected the recession to start, as you said.
And it hasn't officially begun yet.
And that's important, by the way, Adam, because when when the recession
officially begins, the average decline in the S&P 500 is 32 percent.
Going back to data since the end of the Great Depression,
32 percent from the from the start of their official recession.
That is something I think is going to happen in 24.
But again, I was wrong about 2023 recession,
but not so wrong, because in general, the market hasn't gotten gone anywhere.
And the real economy is teetering on a collapse.
Just hasn't happened yet.
And I'm going to go into the reasons during this interview
why I think it's going to happen
and what I'm going to look for to determine when
I will know when to get net short in the portfolio.
OK, great kickoff.
So many great points there to dig into.
I do want to get into exactly what you just laid out there, Michael.
Let's see. Let's see the right way to dive into this.
Let me let me just grab on to the Mag seven stocks for a second.
So they have been the saviors of the market this year, right?
You're saying they're the evidence that everybody's pointing to
that the economy is resilient.
The market's going to do great still from here.
Soft investors don't need to worry.
I just interviewed Fred Hickey, high tech strategist.
He's been following the tech sector for most of his career,
over 40 years publishing on them.
He is really pretty darn bearish on most of them, particularly Apple and Tesla.
But this is a guy who's just sort of, you know.
Paid to cover this industry and probably has a fair amount of incentive
to try to be optimistic when he can be.
And he's he's pretty bearish on them.
But I'm curious, what are your reasons for thinking that the Mag seven
miracle is not going to keep the party going next year?
It's just history based on history, not that I'm some expert,
but if you look at past history, whenever you saw
a consolidation into just a few names of stocks, think the nifty 50.
And this is evident also in other countries.
Whenever you see a very narrow stock market
led by just a handful of names, not the nifty 50, the nifty seven,
it never ends well because you can't have a healthy market
when only a few stocks are participating in that bull market.
If you look at the equal weight S&P 500, it is down 10 percent.
It's still down 10 percent, including the A.I. stuff in the last two years.
So I'm not saying that we need a collapse of the the A.I.
narrative for the market to correct
listed in a recession, the S&P 500 drops 32 percent.
That includes everything nifty fifties, A.I., everything.
So I am not going to sit there and tell you that just because A.I.
is the technology of the future and I believe it is
and I can't wait to invest in it, that that's going to save the stock market
or the economy, because the earnings growth rate
that they are predicting of 11 percent is never going to happen
when nominal GDP is crashing
from where it once was to where it's going to be in twenty four.
So you're going to have an earnings miss and the S&P 500.
And of course, as always, sectors are important, Adam.
You can't just say I'm going to short the entire market and look like a superstar.
But if you play this carefully and you get your timing right,
there's a tremendous amount of money to be made by shorting this market
and by going long the bond market treasury complex in the correct duration.
And then after this.
Consummation of this reconciliation of the asset bubble occurs
that includes real estate as well.
There's a tremendous opportunity to get long.
What I think is going to be a protracted period of stagflation,
such as this country has never seen before.
Wow. OK, you're definitely going to where I want to kind of end up here,
which is, you know, what is your model telling you how to position
and how are you planning on playing this?
You've just given us a little peek into that, which is great.
OK, so let me let me let me go back again.
So you mentioned that, you know, you the recession did not arrive on the timeline.
You thought it was initially you initially thought it was going to in 2023.
And Michael, let me say, you've got tons of company there, right?
You're not the only one.
Almost everybody thought that we were going to have a recession
and we were going into 2023.
I think you were maybe one of the first to call that.
And then the world kind of caught up to you.
But then the world got surprised because the recession did not arrive this year.
2023 will be the year of the recession that wasn't.
And I've had a number of discussions with folks of late of, OK,
so why were the reasons for that?
And it's multifactorial.
But I think the biggest reason, as best I can tell, is.
You warned.
Sure, almost two years ago now that
the markets were going to go through a painful time
because we were going to have the biggest monetary cliff
and the biggest fiscal cliff that the country had ever experienced
happening simultaneously.
And what's interesting is while we did get the monetary cliff,
right, QE turned off, the Fed started really tightening aggressively.
They had been putting on the monetary breaks.
That said, there's been stuff going on with reserves that has really moderated
that, as well as the the BFPP, you know, the bank rescue stuff that went on.
So it's not quite as aggressive as it looks like.
And then we didn't really get the fiscal cliff.
The fiscal side of the house has been still stimulating
pretty hard with deficit spending.
So presumably it's that.
Liquidity on the fiscal side and not quite as heavy
monetary tightening as we thought that has sort of pushed the recession out.
That's that's what I've taken from folks.
Is that your view as well?
So I have two reasons why the recession has been delayed,
but not canceled.
So number one reason is what you just mentioned, a massive,
massive fiscal stimulus from our president, Joe Biden.
The other reason is the terming out of debt, which you didn't mention.
But I will mention the terming out of debt is when, you know,
you lock in 30 year fixed rates on your mortgage and you don't have to
have to have adjustable rate mortgages cause you to sell your house
or the corporations which have locked in long duration
debt out at very low interest rates.
That is changing now. That is changing.
So let me go through what I think, if you don't mind,
if I can go through what's happening now, that lets me think
that as these interest rates have been increased from zero
to five and a quarter to five and a half percent of the Fed funds rate,
as you go through time.
You see people refinancing into higher mortgages
and issuing debt at higher rates,
which is going to lead to the recession.
So if you don't mind, let me go through a few things.
Please do. And let me just note on that, that that is
that impacts both governments, right?
We're already seeing that in the U.S.
with our our interest in federal debt exploding.
That is true of corporations, which will be, you know,
rolling into this rerating you're talking about.
And it's true of households.
So it's it's hitting all aspects of the economy at once or will be going forward.
All right. So let's start.
Exactly. Do you want me to start with the U.S.
debt situation since you mentioned whatever you like, my friend? OK.
All right. I think the U.S. debt is headed for junk status.
And it gives me no pleasure to say that because I love this country
and I wish it wasn't the case.
But the U.S. national debt is now almost 34 trillion dollars.
Our deficit in fiscal two thousand and twenty three was one point seven
trillion dollars.
The interest on that debt alone is seven hundred billion dollars.
And the interest expenses,
excuse me, are going to reach one trillion dollars by 2025.
Entitlements and interest on our debt
is going to equal 100 percent of all revenue by 2040.
The now this is where the rubber really meets the road.
When you think about the U.S., if the United States government was a corporation
or if it was an individual going to the bank,
our annual deficit is forty five percent of total revenue.
And the national debt is a mind boggling
seven hundred and seventy percent of our annual federal income.
Now, I use income to the Treasury because it's a better example
or more illustrative of what we can actually use, because, you know,
the U.S. government can't tax GDP at 100 percent.
It just wouldn't work because no one would go to no one would be employed
and there'd be no revenue.
The revenue would be zero. Ask Art Laffer about it.
So I'm looking at these deficits
and debt as a percentage of the income.
And it's it it leads me to the conclusion and many others
who look at it objectively that the United States government is insolvent.
Now, I talked about the United States.
Let me just touch on global debt.
Global debt is now three hundred trillion dollars.
That's three hundred and fifty percent of global GDP.
And that is twenty six percent.
Not percentage points, Adam.
Twenty six percent higher than it was
that just prior to the Great Recession.
And that was two hundred and seventy eight percent of GDP.
So that's what this is.
This is the situation now we're facing where we have these higher rates
and the higher rates are putting a tremendous amount of pressure on governments.
And, you know, if you don't have the central bank monetizing that debt.
You know, people tell me all the time,
well, and this is like the mantra of the mainstream financial media.
Well, government's debt, government debt doesn't matter
because they could just print it and monetize it all the way.
Well, that's true.
That is true. They have a printing press, all fiat currencies at printing presses.
But if you're going to have a printing press,
you can't also tell me that you don't have an inflation problem.
And if inflation is already jumped the shark two percent to nine percent.
In reality, 20 percent.
You can't tell me that the central bank can just say I'm going to inflate
it all away.
So you're going to have to have the public buy this debt, not the central bank.
And the public demands a real interest rate on that debt.
So, yes, public debt does matter and it matters in a in a big way.
Here's another let's go let's go to corporations now.
There's one point eight trillion dollars
of corporate debt that needs to be refinanced over the next two years.
That debt currently carries interest rate of two point eight percent.
So debt service payments are going to double next year.
More than double. Yeah.
More than double. More than double.
40 percent of companies in the Russell 2004 zero are unprofitable right now.
That figure was 20 percent heading into the Great Recession.
And of course, unprofitable companies have to borrow money.
And the cost of the cost of those funds have already doubled since 2022.
And they're going to double again. So.
Those are the kind of things where you say, well, we're lapping.
Inextricably higher and higher borrowing costs.
And even though those costs were defrayed.
For a couple of years.
They are happening now,
and that is causing the economy to erode.
That's going to cause earnings to erode.
And it's going to lead to let me just say this, Adam, the illiquidity.
Because you mentioned this, I'll just tie it all together for the illiquidity
in the Treasury market is already.
You know, eye popping,
you see Treasury yields trade like I say, you know, small cat
pink sheets stocks would trade.
Let's see what let's see what happens in March of 2024.
In March of 2024, supposedly, I think there's one hundred.
I think there's one hundred and fourteen billion dollars
in the bank term funding program.
Now, don't forget, that's the program that rescued the banking system in March.
You say you say, well, Mr.
Penta, you predicted a recession and recession didn't come.
So you're a moron.
OK, well, I didn't predict that the Federal
Reserve would bail out the entire U.S. financial system, but they did.
So, you know, my portfolio reacted to it.
But without that bank term funding program, you've got the
in reality, the entire U.S.
financial system or basically the entirety of the U.S.
financial system is insolvent right now.
If you take their assets and mark them to market,
they're insolvent, they're upside down.
And that's even worse now than it was in March.
So if in if in March and 24,
the bank term funding program is supposed to be a one year maximum duration.
And at that time, all those assets that they took off the bank's balance sheets,
which were way under water,
should go back to the banks at par.
They were taken from the banks at par.
The banks are going to be taking these assets back on their balance sheets
at the real value that they are right now,
which is even worse than they were in March of twenty three.
So sorry to interrupt, but I just want you to make a prediction right now,
because we're not that far away from the one year anniversary of this.
Are they going to be able to do that or is this thing going to have to be amended?
They have I mean, I mean, I, you know, I listen to the press conferences
that Powell has and I'm like, please, somebody ask him, please, somebody have
the I won't say it that the courage I had an Italian word I was going to use
for the courage to ask Powell, what does he intend to do?
He did bail out the entire financial system.
There's one hundred and fourteen billion dollars there as of the last reporting
series. What do you do?
Are you going to tell these banks, here you go?
Here's your treasuries and mortgage backed securities.
We gave you par, even though they were like 70 cents on the dollar.
And now they're going back to you at 60 cents or 50 cents,
whatever they are on the dollar. Have a nice life.
Then it's impossible. He will never do it.
So he's going to have to extend that.
But there's something else happening in March, coincidentally.
And that is the reverse repo facility,
which I've been talking about this for months now.
I don't know. I think you mentioned it, but I didn't know you were aware of it.
But I should have known because you're aware of so much out of.
Yeah. The reverse repo facility runs dry.
And that's easy liquid in March of twenty four.
That's the easy liquidity that's out there.
That's the easy money right now.
So banks park their excess reserves, which were over two trillion dollars
about a year ago at the Federal Reserve.
They get interest on those excess reserves.
And now what the banks are doing is taking those excess reserves.
And they're buying treasuries with them.
And then the Fed's QT program is washing that much,
just, you know, a balance sheet
equation where you're just taking money out of the RRP
and then you're wiping out the the base money supply through the QT program.
But come March of twenty four, there's no more money left
in the reverse repo facility.
So the bank liquidity runs dry at that at that time, around that time.
And then the illiquidity in the Treasury market goes exponentially higher.
That's another issue for March of next year that I'm watching.
I'm watching closely.
OK, I got to put a pin in that one because I want to.
I want to square that with your outlook for Treasury bonds for next year.
But real quick, before we do, I want to zoom just way up for just a second.
So you talked about how global debt is now 350 percent of global GDP.
And to a certain extent, I think you can categorize, you know, all the.
All the issues that we have economically and financially, my opinion,
you could put the biggest sort of existential challenge
to the whole soup as drowning in too much debt.
And you're nodding as I'm saying this.
So and that's in some ways the the outcome of a fiat
monetary regime, because these these currencies are borrowed into existence
that at some point, if you let them run long enough that the debts mount up
and then that you basically have this this massive debt
overhang that you're forced to make a decision on.
We either have to let all the bad, unproductive debts default,
which is incredibly painful,
or we have to deal with it through by inflating away the currency.
And that's essentially it takes longer.
It's a little less hard to notice, but that is a default of a different sort
because you're just destroying the purchasing power of the currency.
Are we globally headed towards one of these two types of defaults?
And if so, which one do you think is more likely
letting the actual, you know, debts default themselves
or inflating away the purchasing power of these currencies?
Yeah, it's like it's like a bully, like in a school playground.
You know, the bullies talk tough.
But when you actually stand up to a bully and you punch him in the face,
they usually back down because they're basically cowards.
This is this is how, you know, Powell is talking tough
and the rest of Central Bankers, the same thing with Lagarde and the ECB.
They talk very tough about fighting inflation because that's part of their job.
The mandate is stable prices, even though they're the most miserable
track record, miserable track record that you could possibly come up with.
You know, they even define stable prices as 2%.
But anyway, I don't want to digress into that.
The worst thing that a central banker can
engender is a depression and the gravel, the gravitational forces
of debt default demand that a depression occurs,
because there's two parts of the puzzle when you take interest rates
down below 1% for 11
of the past 14 years from 2008 to 2022.
And that is never that has never been done before in this country.
And you can't tell me that that didn't create massive distortions,
economic distortions.
Well, one of them you just mentioned was debt.
But what you didn't mention was the asset bubble part of that,
because what what we what we do when we take out debt.
Is we buy things with it, right?
And when debt, sorry, is plentiful, cheap, you get tons of malinvestment,
which is what you get when you get paid to borrow money,
as was the case of 17 trillion dollars of this debt globally.
Seventeen trillion dollars of negative yielding debt at its apex.
What you do with that debt is you buy things with it.
You buy stocks and you buy bonds, you buy assets, you buy homes.
And we had a triumvirate of bubbles.
The bubble in the bond market was the first to pop.
The Nasdaq, the like I said, the the
S&P 500 equal weight S&P 500 is still down 10%, 10%.
I think I mentioned that statistic to you remember.
So we already and that's in nominal terms again,
we're not talking about the real purchasing power of the S&P 500 equal weight.
So we have the bursting of the bond bubble, which is beginning.
We have yet to see that occur in corporate debt yet.
Amazingly, but that's coming in 24.
One point eight trillion dollars of corporate debt has to be refinanced.
Don't that that's such a key point.
If you forget, if you forget everything else I say about this conversation.
Remember that the debt was termed out.
Corporate debt was termed out in 2020 to 2022.
Two thousand twenty four and twenty five is one point eight trillion dollars
that has to be refinanced at much higher interest rates.
So when you have asset bubbles and you have a massive amount of debt,
the last thing you can possibly afford to have happen
because it's politically suicide is a depression.
A debt default leads to a depression, especially when debt is this much,
you know, disconnected from reality.
And concomitant with that debt default is a crash
in asset prices, particularly real estate now.
Home price to income ratios are higher today than they were at the previous peak
in 2006, which led to the bankruptcy
of the U.S. financial system and indeed the global financial system as a whole.
Home price to income ratios.
What do you think?
What do you think that
the value of banks would be?
What do you think their condition of their balance sheets would be?
Remember, they're already bailed out because banks are under water
because their
their income streams are upside down, right?
They're having to pay more for deposits than they're collecting on their
you know, three and four percent mortgages.
And their balance sheet is upside down because the assets they hold
that they were marked to market aren't aren't worth what they used to work.
They're negative.
They're they're under water.
What are you going to have?
What do you think is going to happen when their assets?
What do you think would happen if home prices were allowed to collapse
down to home price to income ratios?
Went back to say, like, you know, three or four instead of seven.
It's just where they are now in assuming that's because the home prices collapse,
not because the incomes went up, which they are not doing so.
So, yeah, it would be I don't want to use the term Armageddon,
but it would be something on that level to the banking system.
So Powell, so Powell is going to get his if that scenario were to happen.
Powell will get his wish that, you know, inflation would be would be tamed.
He'd get his you know, it would go from nine to where three point
two percent where it is now, then it would go to two
and then it would go to minus five. Right, right.
Oh, my gosh. What are they going to?
So the answer is a very long answer to your question is that we are going
to have both conditions of inflation and deflation at different times.
Right now, we are fighting inflation, which is going to breed,
which bred disinflation, which is going to which is going to lead to deflation,
which is going to lead Powell to do the only thing he can do.
And Lagarde is no different and the People's Bank of China
and the Bank of Japan, they're all going to do the same thing.
They all seem to sing.
These all seem to sing from the same hymnal.
They are going to flood the banking system with money,
and that is going to create stagflation
like we have never before even imagined in this country.
So if you have a static 60/40 portfolio and you're always in bonds
and you're always in long duration bonds and stocks,
or you're always in A.I. and whatever, it doesn't work.
You have to actively and I think you understand this
because you're a big advocate for
having your money managed by a professional.
And correct me if I'm wrong about that.
No, no, I am by a good, experienced professional
who takes into account in their strategy all the things we talk about here,
which is, you know, Michael, a lot of guys don't.
Yeah. Well, Adam, in my opinion, and I've been doing this 32 years,
and I know in this light, you could tell that I've been doing it a long time.
I can make my wrinkles and feel my wrinkles.
I'm 60 years old. I've been doing this 32 years.
And the and I say this and I worked on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
Wall Street is comprised of mostly salespeople.
They get paid to gather assets.
They are asset gatherers, first and foremost.
And on the fringes, you'll get
market strategists and economists.
You get hedge funds, private equity.
There's there's those people out there.
For the most part, what people want to do in this business, 95 percent of them,
they gather assets, plug it into some model that mirrors the S&P 500
and hope they never hear from you again.
And if the S&P goes down, which it does
often and goes down a lot,
they will tell you what you can't time the market.
It's timing in the market time in the market, not timing the market.
Buy and hold a 60/40 portfolio is the only way to go.
Which magically translates into give me all your money.
Don't ask me any questions.
Well, it's easier if I'm sitting at my and this is what I do.
I sit at my desk all day, start at six o'clock in the morning,
and I'm evaluating the economic data as they come through,
assimilating that, putting it through my model and making decisions
about where to invest.
That's why I wasn't net short in 2023.
But if you do that, guess what you can't do?
You can't also go out and gather assets.
This is you, the one or the other.
You're either an asset gatherer and a salesperson,
or you are a market strategist and let your results
speak for themselves to gather assets for you.
Right. And I'm glad you said that because
I don't want to go fully off the rails on this, but, you know,
you want to find somebody, folks who is good, professional,
you know, good track record, understands all the issues
that Michael and I are talking about here,
but whose marketing arm is their results.
Right. Somebody who doesn't have to go out there and hustle
and spend their time at the country club handing out, you know,
business cards and trying to chum their way into clients.
It's somebody who's just doing the hard work
and letting the results speak for themselves.
So someone who's also honest, has integrity like yourself.
And spends their time worrying about their client's money
because their money's in the same construct, the same rubric as yours,
and is trying to do the best thing for their clients at all times
and is not just trying to sell them a a, you know,
reconstituted S&P 500 index. Right.
Well, so, Michael, this is why I want to dig into here,
because you're one of the great guests I like to bring on one,
because you're you've got a great grasp of what's happening macro wise.
But you don't have the luxury of just having an opinion.
You actually have to manage client capital and produce results.
So let's look at your outlook for 2024 here from much of what you've said.
I'm sort of intimating that you believe, like several other folks
I've interviewed relatively recently,
that 2024 is going to be kind of the year where the wheels come off.
You were not net short in 2023,
despite your strong bias at the beginning of the year because of your model.
And you've talked in the past with me in depth about how your model works.
And, you know, it's it's a discipline for you
where you're not just trading on what your emotions are telling you any given day.
You need to have the the support of your model
before you make a big direction and change on your portfolio allocations.
So tell us what you expect the economy and the markets to do next year.
And then tell me how you expect your model to react
and how you think you'll likely be deploying to ride
whatever volatility is going to be in the world next year.
OK, OK, so despite the National Federation of Independent Businesses
constantly presaging that the recession is coming,
we've also had the longest inversion of the yield curve in 43 years, 43 years.
Also, the index of leading economic indicators has been pointing to recession.
So we're heading there.
And as we're lapping the higher rates, the recession is coming.
But my model looks also at
financial conditions, which remain quiescent and credit spreads,
which remarkably, unbelievably remain quiescent.
I mean, if you ask, nobody's worried on that part. Yeah, exactly.
I mean, you're sub 4% on the spread between high yield and treasuries.
These are what is one of the indicators I look at as to when I should be concerned,
because I know credit leads the stock market and I'm not going to get short
until I see some tightening in my own proprietary financial conditions index.
And I see some tightening in the credit spreads.
But let me go over why I why I see that already.
The weakness already happening, which is front running
what I think is going to happen with credit spreads and financial conditions.
So so far this year, let's look at the labor.
Can I talk a little about the labor market first?
Please do. So far this year, companies have announced layoffs
that are are an increase of 198, almost 200% from last year.
If you look at the non-farm payroll report.
Which was being touted as, you know, oh, look at how great
the binomics is working so well.
If you look at the index of aggregate hours worked.
It is lower today.
The October report lower in October than it was in January.
Think about that, let's see.
Now, what does the index of aggregate hours work tell us?
That is the that that's the labor impulse into the economy.
So it takes the number of jobs out there in the hours, you know,
as an index, not just looking at the number of jobs out there,
because if you have a job that's full time,
you know, 10, eight to 10 hours a day working at a factory,
mine, utility manufacturing, and you get fired and you have two jobs.
One is five hours as a Wal-Mart greeter.
And, you know, you know, four hours at
at Kmart and the Kmart's donning and showing my age Starbucks.
How about Starbucks that works?
Well, you've doubled the number of jobs out there.
Oh, binomics is working so well.
But there's no benefits really to speak of.
Maybe there is benefit Starbucks.
I don't want to say there is or there isn't.
But the quality of the job, the income isn't there and the hours aren't there.
So that's what's happening.
That's the truth. This is this is not Michael Pinto's data.
I don't use my own data.
I'm using facts that come from the Department of Labor.
Now, that's the labor market.
Oh, I forgot to mention the
the household survey, not the establishment survey, showed a
decline in October of three hundred and forty eight thousand jobs, a decline.
And the household survey usually leads the establishment survey.
There's also this fiscal drag that we're talking.
Let me just go into briefly why I think twenty four is going to be
again the recession and lead to not a soft landing, but a crash landing.
There's no there's no real fiscal boost coming.
Pandemic related savings are going to continue
to erode in both nominal and real terms.
And inflation inflation is lowering the standard of living.
The lower three quintiles of U.S. consumers are getting crushed.
Let's look, for example, groceries are up twenty five percent.
Since the start of covid, twenty five percent.
Now, are these people's incomes up twenty five percent since the start of Covid?
No way. Now, now the covid
mortgage forbearance programs, FHA insured mortgages and reverse mortgages
are ending, I believe they end November 30th.
November 30th of this year.
That's just a couple of days away. Adam.
These people have not made a mortgage payment in.
In almost three years.
Seventy percent of all mortgages are FHA insured.
Now, student loan payments supposedly,
you know, began again in September on September 1st.
Although many are not paying them. But yes, I, I have my you know,
if Biden had this on ramping
clause in this student loan repayment where he says, hey, listen,
you're supposed to repay your student loans.
I'm sorry. The Supreme Court said you have to do it.
I wish they didn't have to abide by the contract that they signed on to.
But if you don't pay your student loan, guess what?
I will not ding your credit score.
So I have my doubt as to how bad that is going to be for
the recession. But it's out there.
Some people understand they should be paying their student loan.
They're supposed to repay it, and they are.
More importantly, the employee retention credit.
That was a tax credit of up to twenty eight
thousand dollars per employee that expired on September 14th.
So we're starting to see the lagged effects of monetary tightening now.
Let's just say retail sales.
Fell for the first time in seven months in October.
And that is that retail sales are a nominal number.
So if retail sales are down and we know that that's
that's a huge tell of how bad the economy is becoming because.
They're not adjusted for inflation.
Hey, just two things on retail sales.
One is you mentioned the bottom quartiles have been really feeling the pain
in. The Black Friday sales, they're now saying that the top 20 percent,
which has been driving the predominance of the consumer spending,
they're now starting to pinch pennies.
So it looks like even the higher end consumer
is starting to tap out at this point in time.
You're right. Good observation.
Corporate bankruptcies in the U.S.
rose by 30 percent over the past year.
So we're starting to see these these lagged effects
of monetary tightening affect both the labor market
and corporations.
End consumption.
And I see that getting worse, not better as we lap these higher rates in 24.
All right. Well, I have been being the lag of lag effect drum
for months and months and months.
And I appreciate that you are giving us some great examples
of how we're actually starting to see it manifest here.
So, OK, so so
appearing in your crystal ball, I'm not going to hold you to any sort
of real time frame here.
But when do you expect the debate to be over
as to whether we're going to have a hard landing or soft landing or no landing?
Like when because it seems like you expect that like effects to cause.
You know, a visible enough recession
that the market finally gets the memo and the market starts breaking.
So something you expect to have sort of in the first half of the year,
second half of the year, don't know yet.
But I would expect by the end of the first quarter of next year,
especially since the bank term funding program is supposed to expire,
there's a small chance that he might actually let it expire, but.
Probably not. That is that is that is an outlier.
But that when the reverse repo running out, those are two big factors.
But the reverse repo facility going to zero.
Basically zero. I mean, there's usually and I look back
through the decades.
This facility usually has about two hundred billion dollars in it.
We're at eight hundred billion.
So we're close.
And the vector that I see, the trajectory should be
at two hundred billion or less by March, the end of March of twenty four.
And I think at that point, there's chaos in the bond market.
And I want to I want to stress this point
because it's important about where we invest on the yield curve.
I have been short duration bonds
for most of twenty twenty three, just collecting that that higher and higher yield.
So you have been in short duration bonds.
That's what I said. Is that what I said?
I just want to make sure people didn't hear you said you were short duration
bonds. You are short duration bonds. Yeah. Right.
Sure. Short term bonds, T-bills. Yeah.
And the three years and less
and three years and less, because
the chaos that's going to exist
in long duration bonds, there's going to be a small window.
I think it's going to be a very narrow window.
To invest in T.L.T.
and zero coupon bonds.
And then at the end of that, now, don't don't forget,
we have a deficit that's now two trillion dollars, almost two trillion dollars.
Deficits usually rise rise
two hundred percent in recessions, Adam, 200 percent.
So our deficit could easily be five to six
trillion dollars.
After the next recession occurs.
And you have to say to yourself, is the Fed really going to buy all that debt?
And if they do, they're damned if they do, they're damned if they don't,
if they actually endeavor to buy all that debt,
you're looking at stagflation like we have never seen before.
I mentioned that a few times already, and I want to hammer that point home.
That's where I think we're headed.
Now, if they don't buy all that debt.
Interest rates are going well into the double digits.
In this country, in the United States of America and interest rates on double
digits that exist on top of massive bubbles
in real estate and in the stock market are untenable. Right.
So there is just the American economy can't offer.
I mean, I'm surprised it's operating still here at five and a quarter.
Yeah, it's only because of that debt was turned out.
Most of that debt was turned out, but that that changes in twenty four and twenty five.
Yeah, but there is no way you can have a viable economy.
With that much debt and that extent of asset bubbles
and have interest rates go to double digits, which is where they would go for sure
if we had six trillion dollar annual and six trillion dollar annual deficit.
And the public was asked to take that in because what happens
when you have a recession is that your income to the Treasury dries up.
But the automatic, just as the automatic stabilizers kick in.
You know, food stamps and welfare and employment insurance,
those are automatic, but there's no bill or law or discussion
that has to take place in Congress, it just happens automatically.
So if you look at what happened in the Great Recession,
that the deficits went up 200 percent, it could happen again.
So so that's that's what I'm concerned about next year.
All right. So we're beginning to get a little tight on time.
So I want to get to the meat of the burger here, which is
how are you positioned now for what you see ahead?
And I know you're going to follow your large part,
what your model is telling you in real time as the year unfolds.
But how do you currently right now expect to to shift your current positioning
to address the things you think are most likely to happen if they indeed happen?
So 70 percent, 7-0 of our portfolio is in short duration treasuries.
Those are T-Bills and think three years or less, one to three year treasuries.
We have about a seven, eight percent position in physical gold.
We are long about seven to eight percent defense stocks,
aerospace and defense stocks.
We are long the dollar, which is we have been long the dollar for two years.
We have taken that down to a three percent position.
We were close to 10 percent long the U.S. dollar, not too long.
The U.S. dollar against gold
along the U.S. dollar against the euro and the yen and the pound. OK.
And we are we have a very small position, a two percent short junk bonds.
Right now, we are going to take that much higher.
And we have an anti beta play, which is also about two percent.
We're going to take that much higher as well.
That's pretty anti beta, anti beta.
So it's a it's an ETF that shorts all sectors of the market.
The higher volatility sectors of each market.
So if you think the utilities were shorting the higher volatility,
high vol utilities were long, the low volume.
If we're in it, we're in the tech sector.
We're long the low volatility tech and we're short the high vols.
Got it. OK. So we plan on taking that much higher, too.
We also plan to when the model tells me to,
not when CNBC tells me how everything is wonderful or not wonderful,
we will take the short duration bonds,
T-bills and leapfrog going into five to seven year treasuries,
because we want to take advantage of that duration play,
because when the recession does become manifest,
I think long duration bonds will have a huge rally in price down in yield.
And is that is that because of the rescue efforts
that the the central banks are going to take?
Is it because of the crisis trade?
People just want safety. Is it a combination of both?
So so if it's if it's the rescue effort that they're going to take,
that would be a reason to sell bonds.
It's just it's just because when when the when the soft landing myth is debunked,
you're going to have a tremendous amount of people that are sequestered
in Apple and Amazon and Google and Nvidia,
and they're going to say, oh, my God, guess what?
Even though the Internet was really real in 2000
and it was going to change our lives,
you know, Cisco lost 80 percent of its value.
So corporations stop spending money on A.I.
because they're just circling the wagons.
Yeah, they're in survival mode.
Those people who are massively sequestered in the big seven,
the magnificent seven are going to run to bonds
and they're going to run to duration bonds.
Maybe they won't go to zeros all the way out on the curve,
but they'll stay in the belly of the curve.
So around five to seven years, which is where I'm going to be
going to sell the T-bills because the T-bills are going to go down
in in not not down in principle because there's zero duration
down in their interest stream because the Fed will be cutting it.
Fed will be cutting rates.
And I want to capture that
increase in price in duration.
Take advantage of that convexity is what they call it.
And then I think once the Fed capitulates and starts to massively cut
interest rates and starts to stimulate the economy again,
that's going to be a big danger for duration treasuries,
because guess what they're going to be?
Yeah. What are duration treasuries most fearful of?
Inflation, inflation, yeah, inflation.
And that is going to wax.
I think this might be the fourth time I'm going to say
I'm not going to say it, but I said it before.
I don't think the see, here's the thing, Adam.
The bully in the playground could say, I am, I'm the strongest guy out here.
I can fight inflation of, you know, make the allegory to Powell.
I can fight inflation.
I can bring interest rates above inflation and keep it there
and provide people with a real return on their savings.
And then when the whole house of cards collapses,
what is Powell going to do?
Right. He what is he going to say?
There's not anybody on Wall Street who's going to believe him.
They'll all know that this is this is what's going to happen.
You either either allow the gravitational gravitational forces
of deflation to wipe out asset prices, wipe out the banking system,
wipe out the stock market.
Or alternatively, you're going to be forced to print money.
Indefinitely, in a protracted sense, with no end in sight,
real interest rates will be low forever.
Gold is going to explode.
Energy is going to explode.
Basementals are going to explode higher.
Stagflation is going to rain because inflation does erode.
The middle class and no country can withstand.
A middle class that is eviscerated.
Totally agreed.
And Michael, next time you're on, I want to dig more deeply,
just sort of into the nefarious effects of that,
because I think that that's a big trend that's going on right now.
We don't have time in this
interview, which sadly I got to bring to a close pretty quickly here
on on the bond side of things.
I just want to try to thread the needle here if I can.
So you see a safety trade of capital fleeing other assets going into treasuries.
And that's you want to be well positioned to ride the appreciation in the
mid duration.
Notes will say five to seven year notes.
And I understand that when the Fed goes into full blown rescue efforts,
eventually the bond market's going to say, well, wait a minute,
this is permanent inflation.
You know, we need to be compensated for that.
There is a there is a belief and dispel it if it's wrong,
which is when the Fed initially announces it's going to get back into the rescue
game, that bond prices will shoot the moon because everybody is going to say,
hooray, the Fed's out buying treasuries again. Right.
So will there be sort of an initial phase where bonds will rise in price
because of the rescue efforts?
And then over time, they'll kind of get the memo.
This means more inflation and it'll start coming down.
Or do you see a different path in that wonderful question?
Initially, you could see some flight to safety.
But if you're looking, if you backtest that theory,
all those times since 1981, when the Fed's in 87,
when they first started bailing out the, you know, the crash of October,
Black Monday, we all had we always had one problem in this country,
which was not really a problem.
It was a problem for the Federal Reserve.
There wasn't enough inflation there by their measurements.
But yes, by their by their measurement, it was just we just do just, you know,
what are we going to do?
We think the economy can't survive the U.S. the it's
an existential crisis that we have 1.9% inflation, not to.
So so they broke.
They jumped a shark on that in this helicopter money around post covid.
So I don't I don't I think you're correct.
But the period of time has shrunk.
It's it's more truncated because I think people are going to be
much more worried about supply.
Which has never been this high.
And they know where we're heading is inflation.
So I would be much more cautious doing zeros and T.L.T.
And if I did that, I wouldn't want to go out for a long lunch.
I'd be close to the screen because I don't think that's going to last very long.
It'll last for maybe a few months.
But active again, like we were just talking about active management.
Not that, oh, you know, we got 60, 40. How old are you?
Let me go. Let me go. I got a golf date.
The links I got I got you off at 10.
So, you know, that's my answer.
OK, so just in wrapping this up and Michael, you know, when this starts
to you start seeing this, even just hints of this starting to happen,
this progression we're talking about, you come right back on this channel here
and start calling things for us in life, you know, real time audibles.
I will. But when we've talked previously, you have talked about,
hey, when when the vortex of, you know, when the market wakes up to all this
and we potentially get that, you know,
32 percent decline in the S&P, which is what you said
tends to happen in most recessions.
That's the average average. And I think it could be much worse this time.
OK, so it could be much worse this time
during that period when the vortex is sucking everything down.
You have said you want to be in your four horsemen, right?
That's your defensive position.
And if I remember correctly, that is short term T-Bills.
That is long U.S. dollar.
That is gold. I got that correct.
Nope. Gold's later.
So cash, cash, you're right.
Another derivative of cash is another derivative of short term treasuries.
Some physical gold and shorts.
You have to short them up.
You have to be able to short this market because the valuations.
Can I just do I have time?
Just why will you give me 30 seconds? Yes.
So the S&P 500 is trading at eighteen and a half times forward earnings.
That assumes we get a surge in earnings of 11 percent next year.
That forward PE ratio presumes
11 percent is higher than the 10 year average of 17.6.
They said the S&P 500 dividend yield is 400 basis
points lower than the risk free T-Bill rate.
Total market cap of equities right now as a percentage of GDP is one hundred
and sixty percent that that ratio is greater than any other time
in history prior to the outbreak of Covid prior to 2020.
So we have we have a situation now where we have.
A bear market started in the end of twenty one.
It fell 20 percent in twenty two.
We had a brief reprieve for in a few stocks in twenty three.
Phase two is happening in twenty four.
Don't be fooled by the mainstream financial media.
And the level from which the S&P has to fall
from is higher than any other time prior to 2020.
And that is not just in nominal terms.
I'm talking about as a percentage of the underlying economy.
So watch out below.
All right. Great emphasis for just the risk that we're
facing right now in the equity side of things.
So what I wanted to note is you're already
kind of prepositioned in a lot of the four horsemen.
Presumably when this thing really starts, you're going to ratchet up your junk.
Sorry, ratchet up your shorts.
Yeah, maybe. Yeah.
But you'll ratchet up your shorts.
You'll stay in T-Bills and cash and long USD, your
foundational gold position there.
Then when the dust settles,
you're going to rejigger that probably a lot based upon the reality on the ground.
Then presumably there's an opportunity in here to make some real money
after the washout.
So just to be specific, there's the two main things I plan on changing
in the portfolio is exiting T-Bills, going out in duration.
The belly of the curve around five to seven years.
That's the one thing.
But the most thing I plan on looking forward to doing
is increasing the shorts in junk bonds
and increasing the anti beta play and actually taking on
short positions and going long.
I, I, I invest for retirees.
So we have a lot of 401k IRA money here.
So I can't short the stocks in a margin account, which I which
would I will do is go long ETFs that go up in value
when when the stocks go down.
Those are the two things I plan on doing.
And I plan on doing that.
I could actually make money and potentially make money
in the bonds and in the shorts and the USD and in gold.
While everybody else is getting massacred, unfortunately,
the buy and hold 6040 got the guy with the tee off time
at the 930 when the bell rings.
And then on the other end of that, I will completely alter that portfolio.
I won't have any bonds in that portfolio.
I'll have base metals, energy, gold,
a complete stagflation portfolio, which is diametrically opposed
to what I own now.
Hence the value of being with an active manager.
Am I perfect? No.
Do I get a lot of things right? Yes.
And I tend to protect the principle
during bear markets with the potential to make money.
We have a great potential to make money in twenty four
because in twenty two bonds were zero.
There was no room on the upside.
The bond that ballast was gone in the portfolio.
There's no offsetting value.
They got you killed if you owned any, especially going out in duration.
But we have a better chance this time to make money.
And and the model that I've created is great understanding
when the Fed has been successful in reliquifying the financial system
so I can get ahead of the next great bull market.
But understand being long
deflationary hedges is going to get you crushed.
You have to be long stagflationary hedge.
Got it. All right. So got the progression.
I'm going to call your current one that you're in right now.
Still a disinflationary portfolio.
You then get into your four horsemen when the bear market vortex kicks in.
When the dust from that settles, you switch to the stagflationary portfolio
on each of those transition events.
Michael, at a minimum, those are when I want you to come back on this program
and tell us what you're doing in real time.
I promise to do that just for you, just for thoughtful money.
Only for me. That's right.
Please spread it wide, far and wide.
Folks need to know this stuff.
So, Michael, thank you so much.
I appreciate for being short on time.
The challenge with you is it's just when you do a great job
of packing two or three interviews worth of content into one.
And I just wish I had two or three interviews worth of time to give you here.
But again, we'll just have you come back on the program in the future.
For folks that have really enjoyed this discussion and would like to follow
you and your work and learn more about how you manage money, where should they go?
The website is pento port dot com.
On the website, there's a podcast called The Midweek Reality Check.
It's fifty dollars a year.
Gives you some of my higher level thoughts and what I'm thinking about
managing money.
It's called The Midweek Reality Check, as I said.
The office number is 732-772-9500.
My email address is mpento@pentoport.com.
I'd leave you with this thought, if I if I may,
because it really it really irritates me to hear,
you know, the foam ball, the fear of missing out out there.
The stock market is very fragile.
I'm not just talking about 2000 and 2008.
In 2018, stock market got crushed until the Fed raised rates of two
and a half stock market lost 20 percent of its value in a matter of weeks.
In Covid 2020, the S&P lost 33 percent in one month.
In 2022, the S&P lost 30 percent from January through October.
So please don't be a victim again.
Get yourself an active manager who understands
the dynamics between inflation and deflation.
You'll do yourself a lot better and have a much better retirement, in my opinion.
Goodness said it better, agree a thousand percent.
And Michael, when I edit this,
I will put up those links to all the resources you just shared.
I love the fact that you very courageously
share your personal email there for folks to contact you directly.
Get ready for the deluge, my friend.
It's as always, my friend, just been a pure joy and pleasure
to have you on the program. Thanks so much for coming on.
Thank you. And God bless your new venture.
All right. Well, I'm very happy to say that now is the time on the program
where we bring in the lead partners from New Harbor Financial
to react to what Michael Pinto just said, as well as talk about
what's caught their attention in the market since the last time
they and I were on camera together, which was a couple of weeks ago.
I'm joined by lead partners from New Harbor, John Lodra and Mike Preston.
And again, New Harbor Financial is one of the few financial advisory
firms that is officially endorsed by Thoughtful Money.
John and Mike, great to see you guys.
Really good to see you again.
I think this has been the longest hiatus.
We haven't had some active on our parents with you since about 14 years ago
when we first started kind of getting to know each other and collaborating.
So it was a long but we're so happy to be back with you here today.
Well, thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry, Adam, but we just want to say it's real to be back
and knowing you're a long time and and, you know, really value
our relationship and happy to be back here with you on Thoughtful Money.
Well, thank you, guys.
And I do want to very openly and publicly express my gratitude
for just how supportive you've been through this whole transition
ever since you first heard the news.
And so wonderful to have you back on here to share your expertise
with the Thoughtful Money audience, as well as help me begin to get the
the free financial consultations back up and running, too.
I know that's a huge resource that folks have been missing.
But guys, before we get to all that,
we just had another phenomenal discussion with Michael Pinto.
You know, as I was taking my notes, I was sort of ticking mentally in my head.
Yep. OK, this is going to resonate with John and Mike.
Yep. OK, this sounds pretty similar to what the guys at New Harbor doing.
So I'm going to guess that you guys were pretty simpatico
with how Michael is seeing the world here.
But don't let me steal your thunder.
Mike, why don't we start with you? What was your reaction?
Sure. I'll go right to the punch line.
The way that Michael is allocated.
He's very defensive about his defense's defensive as we've seen him,
you know, watching all of his videos and commenting on
quite a few number of the videos that you did with him.
He's he had said that he's at about 70 percent treasury bills right now,
eight percent gold, eight percent defense stocks.
I guess he said he was two percent short junk bonds and two percent anti beta,
which is essentially the kind of large cap growth stocks,
you know, essentially a short exposure there.
You know, we agree that makes sense, it makes sense for most people,
for many people, 100 percent T-bills make sense right now
with treasury bills up at five point two to five point four.
You know, it's really hard to beat that,
and which is why we have a big chunk there as well.
It's not it's not 70 percent.
It's closer to 40 something percent, but it's important to have some dry powder.
Clearly, Michael is very concerned about the economy.
He talks about a crash, you know, essentially a crash landing next year,
a recession or even a depression and followed by stagflation.
This is an appropriate allocation for that type of expectation.
We've never seen valuations as high as they are right now
or or in the last couple of years.
We're still a little bit below the January 2022 high.
I suppose that was the ultimate high valuation point so far,
but we're still right there, not far from there.
And at these levels with a Shiller PE in the mid 30s and even higher,
if you account for margins, stock market cap to GDP that's approaching 200 percent,
all kinds of different things that are just really off the charts high.
And it's almost like they have to stay there forever now,
because if they don't, the whole thing blows up, the whole debt pile blows up.
Michael talked about the debt being 33 trillion
and how by 2040 the payment on that existing debt
will be 100 percent of revenues, tax revenues.
I mean, that's really scary.
So there's not a lot of things that the central bankers can do.
We're kind of backed into a corner.
So he talked about a really defensive allocation.
By comparison, we're about 40 percent treasury bills, 10 percent stock miners,
gold stock miners and about 22 percent stocks in general.
We have very, very slightly increased our allocation to stocks over the last few weeks.
Most of that is hedged.
I'm sure we'll talk about it a little bit more later in this program,
but we saw a lot of our short term indicators reverse up a few weeks ago.
That's why we reduced our hedges and we very, very judiciously
and tactically added some exposure in key sectors that had good chart patterns,
that had very high relative strength against the S&P.
But we still have hedges on our portfolio.
We just moved the strike price or the deductible of those hedges way down.
The strike price was up around 4,500 on the S&P.
On our S&P puts, we moved those down to 4,100 to preserve value.
We didn't want to spend too much premium because we thought a real risk was occurring
of another blow off top and the jury's out.
We can take a look at some charts,
but so far, that's what it's looked like.
As we broke the downtrend a few weeks ago, so we're extremely bearish as well,
but we have to admit that the technical indicators have improved
and that for now, the direction suggests that we should reduce our hedges
and take a little bit more of a bullish stance, although it's a very small one.
All right. I appreciate you sharing that in such detail
because these are challenging times for everybody to navigate,
but certainly challenging times for professionals like you where you're out there having to,
you've got your fiduciary responsibility to try to grow the wealth of your clients,
but to do that in as risk-managed a way as possible.
You're seeing this market that you fundamentally think is overvalued,
but you've been able to make that case for many, many years.
It doesn't mean the market's going to correct tomorrow given these extreme readings
and you now are seeing technically in some other indicators
that show that it may indeed have some more further room to run.
So, rather than just sitting on your hands fully and being fully out of the market,
you are saying, "Okay, we're seeing that we can take some opportunity
to capture some of that run-up if that goes on,
but because we're skeptical about the market,
we are putting our hedges or our insurance in place
so that if somehow a market correction catches everybody, including us by surprise,
at least you guys have these safety nets in place that kick in
before the market falls that much and therefore really buffers your portfolio
versus further losses from there where, of course,
many, many other people are just riding fully along.
If there is a market correction like that catches everybody by surprise,
they're going to be really hurt by it.
So, John, I'll let you react as well before we turn on the camera.
You were telling me about sort of interesting report from Vanguard,
which is famous for creating its index funds,
which has been driving so much of the passive investing trends of the past two decades.
And it sounds like even they are now a little bit worried about
or maybe sounding a bit of an alarm about a passive investing strategy
in this market where valuations are so extended, like Mike was saying.
Yeah, I'd love to talk about that.
And it really kind of hearkens to Michael Pento's comments about
the traditional 60/40 static portfolio,
not only having been a really challenging way to have invest over the last couple of years,
but going forward will likely be very challenging.
That's very much in our DNA.
We don't think having static allocation makes sense.
We think tactical shifts, either among sectors of the stock market,
but more importantly, allocations between different kinds of assets
that we've already talked about and we agree with Michael Pento,
having a very large allocation to not stocks or long-term bonds,
but very short-term treasuries makes a lot of sense.
That flies in the face of the static passive investment philosophy.
But the fact is, as you've preluded there,
Vanguard even came out with a report recently and basically,
and we did a very short video review of this report on our own YouTube channel,
the finest New Harbor Financial Group on YouTube.
But basically, they have some very pointed comments in there that a static portfolio
can and oftentimes does fall far short of meeting the goals.
And when we think about goals, we think about our clients.
It's not about getting eyeballs on CNBC or any channel,
but about helping our clients make sure that the money they have is not here just today or tomorrow,
but it's going to be there for 30, 40 years or more perhaps during retirement.
So Vanguard did a report there and they highlighted that there have been periods
when valuations are high that stocks, for example, have had a negative 5% annual return over 10 years,
bonds even 0%, and it correlates with valuations.
Valuations are very poor short-term timing indicators,
but they're actually quite robust predictors of longer-term returns.
In fact, you can show mathematically that the statistical usefulness of
valuations becomes more robust the longer you look out in time.
So for example, valuations are very poor predictors of performance over the next one year,
for example, or the next three months,
but they're very robust predictors of performance over the next five, seven, 10 years.
In fact, the longer the timeframe,
the more statistically robust those valuations become.
So that's our view of long-term investing,
using that information to tactically
underweight things like equities when they're extremely overvalued.
So yeah, absolutely.
We totally agree with Michael's comments there and we not only agree with it,
but we express that in how we advise our clients to allocate their portfolios.
All right. That's why it's so worrisome when we pull up that chart that Jon Hussman has,
the scatter plot that he shows that basically projects
the expected average 12-year return for the S&P given its current level of valuation.
I believe that's still hanging out in
the negative four percent annually for the next 12 years.
As you said, it tends to be more predicted the longer timeframe you go out.
So that's a little bit worrisome.
All right. So a couple of quick things.
One, you mentioned the New Harbor YouTube channel,
and I want to give you guys some kudos for that, some well-deserved kudos.
You guys have been the past couple of months really investing
in producing a lot of content yourselves on your new YouTube channel.
I got to say, guys, it's great that you do
a really good job of creating these pretty concise, digestible explainer videos,
either about things that have just happened in the market or trying to make
a certain concept better understandable to your audience.
So folks, if you're watching this,
if you haven't been to the New Harbor YouTube channel,
just go to YouTube and type in New Harbor and search for it.
I want to make it very clear that our channel is primarily,
we want to be able to speak to our clients at their level,
and we're never going to try to be what
you have created and will create again with thoughtful money.
In fact, we are as hungry digesters
of your information as probably your most avid viewers,
because in our seats,
Mike and I, we pride ourselves and our team of
being experts and we set high standards for ourselves,
but we also need to inject a tremendous amount of humility.
One way we do that is make sure we take in the perspectives
of others and challenge our own strong-held beliefs.
So your channel, the guests that you bring on,
we're not only pure with you,
but we digest viciously the content you put out.
So we thank you for that.
Well, thank you, and Mutual Admiration Society.
And it's interesting, I get people who are saying,
"Well, Adam, I love thoughtful money.
I've stopped watching this channel or that channel."
And I just want to make it clear to folks,
it's not a competition.
There's lots of great educators out there all over the world,
and we should be ingesting as much
of the useful quality content wherever we may find it.
So anyways, I just want to flag that.
I think a lot of the stuff you guys are putting out
is a great complement to the long-form interviews
that we do here.
All right, so last thing on Pento,
he sort of scoped out this arc of last hurrah run-up,
followed by probably pretty vicious market correction.
He talked about the average correction of 32%
in the S&P during recessions,
and he's thinking it could be worse than that,
given how overvalued things are.
But then he sees a prolonged period of stagflation
over after that, right?
And each of those different phases
requires different positioning that went through with him.
I'm curious, for his stagflation forecast,
how does that fit versus sort of how you guys see the world?
- I guess I'll respond to that.
I mean, stagflation implies inflation
coupled with stagnant growth.
It's possible.
Yeah, my own opinion,
and I think that John and I mostly agree on this,
my own opinion is that I think that we see
an asset price crash that surprises most of us,
which could even, in my opinion,
could even roll into deflation.
I think that potential deflation
is a bigger risk than stagflation.
We'll see.
But it's in the policy response to that shock,
that surprise, that we may see
either runaway inflation or stagflation.
And I think that Michael was saying or implying
that stagflation could come in conjunction
with the Fed's response,
because they are gonna flood the world with dollars.
That's all they know.
That's all they do.
And from these levels of valuations,
and you mentioned Hussman's chart earlier.
It's funny, I actually have it up
on my other monitor at the moment.
Valuations imply negative returns from these levels.
That either means that we, in general,
won't go higher from here,
or if we do, we'll end up lower
than we are today, 10 years from now.
And so, Michael also talked about,
and I mentioned how 100% of tax revenues
you're gonna go to pay the debt by 2040.
That's only 17 or 16 years away now.
If you throw an economic contraction
or a stock market crash into that mix,
and on top of that, a housing market crash,
which has to happen in general,
the whole wealth effect,
historically, has gotta come unwound.
That's what happens when you print fake money
to solve every problem.
So, you know, I don't know how to predict
whether we're gonna see stagflation
or straight off inflation.
I mean, inflation, I suppose,
would be a measurable economic growth
coupled with inflation.
You might be able to accept that
if you've got good GDP growth,
but stagflation would be more of a flat GDP
coupled with, you know, horrible inflation.
The way that we're approaching that
is high cash values,
hedges on whatever equity that we have,
and a strategy on how to get in
and what we think is likely to be the crash.
We have a layering strategy
coupled with options that we will start layering in
to either sectors or indexes, indices, I should say,
on the way down at key technical levels.
But the charts that Hussman and others point out
say that the market should be,
or the S&P should be at 1800 or below
to produce 8% returns.
You know, I hate to say that,
but that's like a 70% decline from the top.
And if we have one more blow off top after this,
and we could, it's only gonna get worse from there.
You know, there's people on Twitter
and on the internet calling for moves up to 6,000 plus
on the S&P.
We can't rule it out,
but ultimately the crash will be worse.
And without really strong GDP growth,
which we're not seeing,
nor can we likely produce organically,
the market's bound to be a lot lower.
So high cash, buy the dip very slowly,
very slowly and with hedges,
and hopefully get fully invested at much better levels.
And so that's probably my best answer.
The only last quick thing I'd say is about bonds.
I do think, like Mike thinks,
that there will be a short opportunity,
short being six, 18 months.
You know, where long bonds will rally quite a bit.
And, you know, I think that could do well
during that time as well.
- Okay, obviously bonds, the future of bonds,
very different,
whether you're going into a stagflationary environment
or deflationary environment.
And basically we're gonna have you guys on the channel,
you know, weekly from here.
So you'll be able to kind of, you know,
audibly, you know, iterate your projections
based upon what's happening on the ground.
Just because we've mentioned it a couple of times,
I'm just gonna pull up the latest version
of this chart from John Hussman
that we've been referring to.
This is his chart that's basically, you know,
looking at history and saying, okay,
when the S&P has been this valued,
here are the 12-year returns it tends to deliver.
You can see here, this chart's the most recent one
I could find, but it's over a year,
sorry, a month and a half old here,
showing back in kind of mid-October
when stocks were lower than where they are right now,
valuation wise, that it was projected
to deliver a negative 4% return per year
for the next 12 years.
And so folks, it probably doesn't mean, you know,
like clockwork every year is just down 4%.
It probably means pretty wild swings,
big corrections, big recoveries and whatnot.
But the net change would be, you know,
a decade plus of negative returns in the stock market,
given, you know, where we're starting from today.
If, you know, is this gonna happen?
I don't know, we're gonna be watching very closely,
but as John said, it's studies like this
that tend to be where valuation
tends to be a lot more predictive
when you're looking at it over a much longer timeframe
than say the next month or the next quarter.
So, all right guys, we're running out of time here.
Real quickly, we have seen gold kind of wake up of late.
And I know gold plays a role in your guys' portfolio.
I know that you guys have held it for a long time,
especially given concerns about inflation
and loss of purchasing power
and just the general undervaluation of commodities.
But John, maybe I'll hand the football to you here
in terms of wrapping up.
Is there anything about the recent action
in activity in gold that's catching your eye
more so than when gold was back up here last?
- Yeah, absolutely, love to talk about that.
And it is one piece of our portfolio allocation.
We're not all in,
but we think it's a very important part of the equation.
And we agree with Michael Pinto's comments
about interstate static flash share environment.
That's exactly the environment
where something like precious metals and commodities
can actually do quite well,
even if bonds and stocks,
traditional financial assets do poorly.
Adam, I'd like to share a couple of quick charts though,
if I could, you kind of illuminate this discussion.
So hopefully you can see this,
your viewers can see this chart.
First thing I want to point out
is gold has kind of gotten a bad rap.
This chart, what I've done here,
and we actually, to be clear,
many of our clients own gold bullion in various forms
and accounts and faults and things like that.
And we actually, from an investment standpoint,
like the gold miners,
they're obviously a very appropriate way
to play a longer term move in gold,
but the miners actually quite undervalued
relative to the price of metal itself.
And you might even say, we freely admit,
they've been laggards relative to the metals,
if you look out over the last three years, for example.
The caveat though, the last one month or three months,
the miners have outpaced the metal itself.
So we think that's a rather encouraging short term,
maybe handing over the baton, so to speak,
the relative strength.
But this chart here,
I wanna first kind of point out that
as much as these mining stocks have frustrated people
who hold them, including us and our clients,
if you look, if you go back to the peak
in the stock market of January, 2022,
and this basically shows the performance of the broad,
some broad markets, the S&P 500,
the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500 eco weight.
Gold miners as measured by GDX and ETF
has actually outpaced on a total return
over that timeframe, the last essentially almost two years.
If we look at year to date,
with the exception of the sectors,
and these are sector ETFs,
the sectors that are very heavy weighted in the mag seven,
the magnificent seven stocks,
these super overvalued stocks like Nvidia and Apple.
And we've talked about a magnesium here,
but you look here, gold miners have actually been up
about a 9%, this is year to date,
and it's outpaced pretty much every sector,
except for the tech sector,
which is again, heavyweight to those mag sevens,
the consumer discretionary,
which has some of these discretionary item stocks
that we think are in the crosshairs
with looking at consumer debt loads
and start raising default rates and things like that.
And then the other sector was communication.
That's, I think, very heavily weighted in two stocks,
Facebook and Google, right?
So those are part of the mag seven.
So as bad a rap as gold miners have gotten,
they've actually done pretty darn well
over the last couple of years,
and especially this year to date.
So I wanna stop sharing that
and just go to a near term chart of the gold miner
just to eliminate that a little bit more.
So I'm gonna share our trading screen here.
This is a chart of GDX, again, the gold miners.
I'm gonna hide our faces here, hopefully.
So this is a daily chart.
Each one of these bars is a daily move.
We had a massive, massive move higher yesterday right here.
Today we're kind of flat, virtually unchanged,
but a couple of things.
We had a low here recently at $25.62 a share in GDX.
This is, again, a basket of mostly senior gold mining stocks.
This is a very powerful breakout from this.
And in fact, you can kind of see
what we might call a head and shoulders
technical pattern here.
If we draw the neckline somewhere around here,
this projects a move up to 33, 34-ish.
So a pretty good further move from here.
You'll see some dotted lines here.
These are basically hedges we have.
We have a collar position
on half of our gold mining exposure.
Where we have a put option
that basically protects below that prior low.
Okay, and we paid for that put option
by selling almost virtually costless.
There was a couple of pennies of debit that we had per share.
I think it might've been about 4 cents per share.
So relatively negligible.
But we sold the call option here at this,
what we would see as a natural resistance level at 33.
So that, you know, and the other half we have on hedge.
So this is a very powerful near-term breakout.
Combine that with the last month and last three months
outpacing of gold bullion by the miners.
And we think it's a very powerful setup.
- That's awesome.
And I'd love how you show there
how you guys are using options
to both add safety and security to the portfolio.
But if you ever get into a scenario
where your covered calls are getting called away
to a certain extent, you're pretty thrilled.
'Cause it means the underlying assets
actually done really well
and provided a really nice return for your clients.
- That is right.
And, but we also actively manage those option positions.
We, you know, if the conditions support it
and we'll take the evidence as it comes,
there's nothing stopping us
from moving that collar hedge out and upward.
So in effect, you know, similar to like a trailing stop.
So just because we have a call option
and that expires in a couple of weeks,
middle of December, by the way.
So we'll be reviewing and what to do with that.
But it's very possible that we may move those up and out.
So, you know, our clients may not be leaving any money
on the table in terms of capped upside
'cause we may have the opportunity to move those hedges
up and out and still ride a trend
if it continues in that direction.
- Great.
And folks, this is a big reason
why I have these financial advisors
come on this channel every week
is to show you how professionals are thinking
and reacting to what's going on in the markets,
but also using their expertise to do things
like mitigate risk while still preserving
as much open upside as possible.
And, you know, having them come in every week
gives us the ability to see how they're making changes
in real time, week to week in their portfolios
to what's happening on the ground.
And again, this is a reminder for folks.
You know, this channel is of the mindset
that most people watching this are regular people
with real lives or real demands on their time.
They don't have the expertise, the time,
the bandwidth, the interest to be managing,
you know, their financial portfolios
in this highly focused way that the professionals do,
which is why I think you should work with,
most people watching should work with a good professional.
Obviously one who takes into account all the issues
that Michael and I talked about
and that the advisors here and I talk about.
I have the guys like New Harbor on
so you can see what a good financial professional looks like.
You will have the opportunity if you want to,
to talk to these guys and have a free consultation with them
if that's what you choose.
But if not, at least you know
how a good financial advisor looks,
thinks, talks, operates, et cetera.
So that when you're surveying
and talking to other different ones,
you know hopefully how to separate the good ones
from the posers.
All right, so folks, I gotta wrap things up here.
John and Mike, it's so nice to have you guys back on.
The program, Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
Great having you back on, great commentary.
Folks, as I mentioned,
we are setting up a free consultation service
where if you just want to talk to
one of the endorsed financial advisors by Thoughtful Money,
have them give you feedback on your personal situation
and what they think you should do.
I'm working furiously in the background to get that set up.
Once it's up and running,
you will be able to go to thoughtfulmoney.com
and schedule one of those free consultations.
It's not quite up and running
as at the time we're recording this,
it may not be up and running exactly
by the time this video airs,
but it should be up and running within a week or so.
And so if you're going back to that URL
and it's still password protected,
hopefully within a couple of days, it shouldn't be anymore
and you should be able to go access it
and schedule a free consultation
if that's what you want to do.
More on that as I make progress.
And just wrapping things up here, folks,
if you enjoyed this conversation with Michael Pento,
who's always wonderful to talk to
and you wanna see him come back on the program
and if you wanna show John and Mike how excited you are
that they've been able to join us here,
please show all that by hitting the like button,
then clicking on the red subscribe button below.
What was that little bell icon right next to it?
And as a reminder, at my new sub stack
where I'm giving lots of updates
on the whole thoughtful money movement throughout the week,
I'm also sharing my Adam's notes,
which are my write-ups to all the main interviews
that we do here on this channel.
And if you wanna get those, go to the sub stack,
the premium subscribers get those Adam's notes
to sign up to the sub stack for free or for premium,
just go to adamtagert.substack.com.
And again, by the time you see this video,
the notes for the interview with Michael should be published.
All right, John and Mike,
just wanna give you guys the last word here.
Mike, anything you wanna say to folks as we wrap up?
- Just wanna say it's good to be back here with you, Adam,
and we really do enjoy speaking
to folks that reach out to us.
We're serious when we say that we wanna help.
You're not gonna get a sales pitch, reach out to us.
We'll have a big prank discussion.
We'll give you our best unbiased advice.
And a lot of people have found that valuable
and we enjoy doing it.
So thanks for watching.
- All right, folks.
I know this has been a bit of a long video,
but if you're still hungry
for more of this type of information
and you haven't seen it yet,
I had an interview with Simon Hunt
that just released right before this one.
And I'll tell you folks,
there are bearish outlooks out there,
and then there are Simon Hunt's outlooks out there,
which are just incredibly bearish.
But I think it's a very valuable discussion to listen to
because Simon sits outside of the US, he's based in Dubai.
He's been a commodity expert for his very long career.
So watching the flows of commodities is his expertise,
which is basically like watching the flow of blood
through the global economic circulatory system.
It gives him a really interesting
and somewhat unique insider's view on what's going on.
And for that alone, I think it's worth listening to.
If you haven't watched that yet,
I'll put up a link to it right here
so you can watch it after this video.
John and Mike, thanks so much, guys.
Again, great to have you back here.
Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
