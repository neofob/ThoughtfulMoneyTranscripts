Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. The media is full of reports that the economy is in fine shape due to a
"strong and resilient consumer" who has held up much better than expected during the recent years of high inflation and high interest rates.
But has the average consumer truly shrugged all that off? Or are they in worse shape than we're being told? For a deep dive into the true state of the US
consumer, we'll hear today from Neely Taminga, researcher, professor, and co-founder of the retail consulting firm Distill.
Neely, thanks so much for joining us today.
Thank you, Adam, for having me. It's a joy to be here.
Thanks. It's a real pleasure. I've been following you for a good while on Twitter. Really appreciate your tweets there and the value of them.
You bring a lot of data to the party, which I very much appreciate. Fun to meet you for the first time here, Neely.
Look, lots of questions here for you. Like I said, we're going to take a deep dive here into the state of the American consumer because that's
really kind of your bailiwick. Before we get there, though, can I just kick this off with a general question I like to ask all my guests at the
start, which is what's your current assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
Oh, you know what? I love not having an assessment of the global economy. I get to focus singularly on the US consumer.
We get asked every once in a while to do engagements well outside of our wheelhouse.
And I have tremendous joy in saying no. We say no to a lot of things so that we can serve our expertise and just the US consumer.
So I read the news like everybody else and I pay attention to it.
I even teach international business occasionally when they're at the bottom of the barrel on professors.
But I will say the focus that we have is primarily the US consumer. And to answer that question, it depends which consumer.
You know, this is a really interesting year in 2024 when the consumer is not going to act monolithically.
And we're here for it. We think it's the nuances where the alpha will be.
Okay. So when you say which consumer, you know, on this program, I've talked in the past about how the economy seems to be really
bifurcating, where it's kind of like the top whatever percent. You probably know the dividing line better than I.
I kind of pick roughly the top 10% because they seem to own the vast majority of the financial assets.
But it sort of seems like they've been doing just fine. And of course, as the financial markets have been off to the races,
they're doing even better as a result. But then everybody else seems to not be enjoying that party.
And a number of them seem to feel growing pressures here as the cost of living has continued to go up.
And even though wage growth has picked back up, it still hasn't made up for the huge two year period or so of negative real wage gains or losses.
Is it a two tier consumer landscape like that? Or is it even more broken up than that?
You know, we we actually view it's way more than that. We think it's way more multilayered. It's layered by life stage right now.
It's layered by income demographic. It's layered by employment status.
It's in it's also layered by we think it's even layered.
Unfortunately, this year it's going to be layered by political affiliation, probably, too.
Right. And that's going to be probably one of the more depressing elections that we have ahead of us,
no matter which side of the aisle you're on this year. So it's it really depends.
There's a lot of different nuances to it. And that is and that's OK.
This is actually what it should be. I think it was.
Look, we go back to 2020. You know, everybody was shutting down.
And I'll never forget we made a huge bet. My husband and I actually in going long March of 2020.
And we did that because I knew as soon as that CARES Act was going to be passed, the consumer was going to act very, very predictably.
You hand them a ton of cash with no strings attached and they are going to spend it.
And it's wild. You know, the federal pandemic unemployment compensation of the summer of 2020.
You know, everyone was concerned about laying off 24 million people overnight.
But I know that when you handed for 18 straight weeks, people more than six hundred dollars a week of extra payment.
Guess what? They were actually making more money than they were while they were employed.
So, you know, it really is follow the money. And in 2019, that's not how it was to predict the consumer economy.
It was probably the easiest year ever was to predict the consumer economy in 2020, even though that seems maybe counterintuitive.
So we continue to think we're going back to normal, you know, different different strokes for different folks.
And that's what's going on. You know, everyone's got a little bit of a different situation.
If employment holds, we'll be OK to navigate that nuance.
It's really navigating whether or not that overall employment demand is going to be able to hold while we're trying to figure out what's the new normal in consumer demand.
OK, well, you can bet I'm going to bring the conversation to employment here in just a little bit.
All right. Well, how do you want to tackle this then?
So you've told us there are a number of different ways in which you sort of slice your lens of the consumer and that that's actually more business as usual for you.
So we've sort of had business as unusual maybe the past couple of years as everything got deformed by all the stimulus and intervention.
So I'll let maybe you drive here initially and then just pop in with questions.
Let me show we have a little visual. I'm a visual learner myself.
And so we pull this little visual for our clients when we're talking about what's going on with the consumer.
Maybe this will help us and your viewers as well.
And what you can see here is this isn't the whole U.S. economy, but this gives you a little bit of a sense of both the life stage as well as perhaps you can imply some economic variables.
On the left hand side, these are the three primary groups we're constantly looking in and around mainly because of their size and their impact.
Millennials as parents is a huge component right now. If they're parents, they're typically they have houses, they have jobs.
In many cases, they have multiple jobs and they are significant.
They're just really kind of getting into that sweet spot of spending on the economy.
And we think about this group all the time. Millennials are exceedingly frugal relative to generations before them.
They're anxious in many ways, too, but they're studied consumers and they will spend where they see the value.
And so that's what a lot of people have to focus on is, you know, are they actually providing the value to millennials?
But they are in aggregate, you know, 70 plus million in size and parents and homeowners, right, increasingly becoming homeowners.
And they are they're spending and that's a pretty decent force in our economy.
Then you have the consumers as retirees, you know, 66, 65 million strong in this group.
These are the baby boomers. They're living large.
Like you're seeing great. You know, we're joking about first watch restaurant group today.
They had some really good sales overall. These people love to brunch and pickleball right now.
You know, they love to live in these communities and hang out with one another.
I was just spending time with my mother in law. She's an amazingly healthy woman of 78 years.
And she her life is vibrant. Like I have a hard time fitting in her schedule.
OK, to spend time with her sometimes. She's just extremely busy and it's it's wonderful and glorious.
But the consumers of retirees, they have had a whole different economic situation.
You know, the cost of living increases, the stock market vibrancy, their Gen X children, you know, me included.
They're there. They don't need help from their parents at this point. Right.
And so they're kind of living large and focused on grand grand babies and and living active lifestyles.
And so we have a pretty solid understanding of what's going on with the millennial group.
And we have a pretty solid understanding of the consumers as retirees.
And if you look at that, that's an aggregate about one hundred thirty million folks out of three hundred thirty million in population.
The U.S. in the primary consumption households. The group that we don't know about.
OK, the one that we're we're just very focused on making sure we understand this group is what's going on with these levered consumers.
They're Gen Zers largely right now, we believe, in terms of the overleveraged. They are also maybe on the younger side of the Xers.
We need to make sure their jobs hold up. We're trying to look at their wages.
We're trying to get a sense of truly where their leverage is because we're not really sure by now pay later is fully capturing what's going on in the leverage piece of consumption.
But that's the group that we're probably most worried about in terms of tripping up on consumption.
So hopefully it's not data that you're probably looking for, but there's data behind every single one of those statements.
But it's the visual of those three groups that we're most focused on trying to figure out.
Super helpful. I'm a visual guy, too. So this really helps me.
A couple of questions about some of these cohorts, if I can interrupt the flow just for a minute here. All right.
So we've got millennials that are hitting their prime spending, earning and spending years.
But that's what makes them really important as a cohort here, besides just their size, is they're really coming into their full spending potential.
And of course, we have a consumer spending driven economy. So that's super important.
One might say, I can think of a whole bunch of conflicting narratives here, so I want you to start batting them down.
One is that, well, as the millennials are entering their key spending years, the wave of boomers that retire,
the famous 10,000 boomers hit retirement age every day.
You would think they would maybe start ratcheting their spending down because they're now not working anymore.
You're saying that's not what you're seeing right now, right? It sounds like you're saying those guys are still living large.
Maybe their portfolios are fat from record high all time stock prices and stuff like that.
They can now get a return on their bonds, which they couldn't get for much of the past decade.
And so we're not having that seesaw of millennials rising while spending of retirees go down that they're both spending.
So I guess you could make an argument, hey, we should have a lot of economic growth going forward because everybody who can spend is spending.
I want to flip the script a little bit where we've heard that millennials would be the first generation to not have the same quality of life,
the same economic prosperity as the generations that came before them. So yes, they're a big cohort. Yes, they're beginning to spend.
But do they potentially have less to spend because they're not as wealthy on a relative basis as boomers were at that same age?
That's a really great question, and I'm going to answer it with something we're pondering. How about that?
Because the interesting thing, this is more putting the straight up demographics hat on for us.
One of the more interesting things that we have to observe is millennials formed households later.
I think that no one's really debating that point. They onboarded later and therefore the dual incomes happen later and therefore the time value of money happens later.
I mean, you can do all the things about later, later, later. And is that going to be a positive thing? Is that going to be a negative thing?
Obviously, the HP 12 C would tell you earlier is better with more income earlier, invested, et cetera, et cetera, time value money.
OK, here's what's interesting. And this is a when I think of how we sort our brain space, it's like, what do we know? Because it's factual, observable, and generally everybody agrees with it.
You know, what do we believe, even when you have conflicting facts? Because this is, you know, you've researched it and you have deep time and expertise into understanding what that belief really is.
And then if we're not left with what do we not yet know? I think that we're not yet doing our full time job in the not yet know space, which is where I love to live, because I think that's where we find the alpha.
In the not yet know space for millennials, maybe it's possible that because they've onboarded later in their household formation years, will the divorce rate actually be a lot lower?
No. And when you think about just the sheer amount of cost that divorces can have to personal wealth and income and like you think about what that might look like.
I mean, this is something I would love more people to actually study this. I think millennials are going to be married longer and happier than the generations before them.
And what could that mean on the other side of that wealth creation? So I'm not here to like break up with the idea that millennials can't be a powerful economic force.
I think time will tell. But certainly, you know, the boomers did not do themselves a favor with their divorce rates at a very high level.
And it'll be just fascinating to watch. What does it look like if you stay intact from a financial perspective, too?
I open this up. If readers see this or watchers see this or listeners see this, send me the literature. I would love to see and read it, because I think this is going to be a very interesting case study on millennial house formation, but then also resiliency.
That's a great point. That's a great point. And certainly, you know, as an exer, you and I are exers. But millennials, I think our generations have sort of we saw, you know, a lot of us grew up in divorced households.
And I think a lot are saying, hey, if I can avoid that, I will. Right. And so, you know, we all know that divorce is a real impediment to wealth building over time.
So maybe it's a really interesting theory. So the questions I'm going to ask next, are there more shorter term than what the millennials do over the next 20, 40 years as a cohort?
Just because I'm trying to get a sense of where the consumer driven economic spending may go. Let me go back to our retirees who even though they got divorced, are still doing pretty well on average.
And this, I think, I believe this bucket, the mean really matters more than the median to a certain extent, where you probably have a lot, you know, a smaller amount of very wealthy households that are really pulling up that average.
Because I read a lot, at least, of how unprepared the median person of retiree age is to retire. I mean, you see different estimates, anywhere from $0 saved in the median retirees account up to maybe like $100,000.
But either one is not enough, you know, if you're 65 years old to fund the next 20 to 30 years of your life, right? So how do we square the "Hey, retirees are doing great" with the data that seems to suggest that there's an awful lot of them that are totally unprepared for retirement?
Agreed. And we may not actually see the wall hit on this just yet. And I don't know when that's going to be.
My parents, you know, my parents were born in the years where you were at the absolute peak of the boomers, right? So I have an actual visual in my head around what that population wave looks like and where they're at in their state of life.
Granted, their experiences are not everyone's experiences. But I'm in the camp that Belize will age in place. And I think you're seeing that now. I think there's evidence to say it has been happening for a while.
I guess I'm always a little sad when I see the narrative around like, you know, aren't the boomers being so greedy for sticking around in their homes, you know, and it's like, well, you know, it's their assets, their homes, or they're able to do whatever they want to do with it.
And that that agent in place, Adam, I think is going to be a a lengthener of their ability to consume and to spend it for multiple reasons. So go with me on this.
First and foremost, you don't I mean, it is so expensive to go into these these assisted living type homes or communities and what I mean, like it's a significant shift. And way back in the day, you had to show what your income was lately.
And I mean, like in the last, I think, 10 plus years, you have to basically show what your asset values are. You have to kind of hand over your your assets to these organizations as you go into these assisted living type homes and communities.
And so you really don't transfer, you know, kind of your wealth from one from your generation to the next, because you kind of just say, I'm going to not be a burden to my children in retirement in these final years, and therefore I'm just going to hand over my home to, you know, and ultimately the assets to the assisted living place.
That's a big shift, you know, and how that kind of transfer of wealth looks. And I think because of that, you're seeing more and more of these boomers just decide to age in place.
COVID also plays a really interesting thing, something we've observed and we've read some literature around this has been when everybody did their COVID bubbling right in 2020, it kind of redefined what you were determining as your community.
So for some people, they redefined their friend groups based on choices around masking or not masking, vaccine or not vaccine. You know, people were like, hey, we want to be close to grandma and grandpa, so we're going to COVID bubble with them.
There are statistics out there that have flown around how parents during 2020, 21 and 22 have increasingly written a check to their millennial children, older millennial or younger millennial children in order to buy homes dot dot dot near them where they currently have their homes.
You know, you saw kind of that out of urban back to suburban sort of movement. And so I guess I asked the question back. Yes, you're right, there's a lot of people who haven't saved much, and they definitely will.
And I think I do, I'm concerned, right for what these retirees are going to need in their later years. But there's definitely a tranche of call it middle America type retirees that are probably able to live in community with their family.
And in aging in place in a home that they wouldn't be able to I mean, either they own it outright at this point or the monthly payment is reasonable enough right to kind of manage through a part time job and some sort of Social Security.
They're just going to live longer, I think, in their communities in age and place. So that's where we're at on that. But that's definitely an area where you can't find a definitive data point. That's a great example of you have to pull the mosaic together on that one to come up with that assessment, which is what we've done.
Okay, so I'm going somewhere with this. So what I hear from you so far, you're saying, you know, millennials, all things considered, they're doing okay. Retirees, doing okay. I don't hear you ringing a warning bell saying like, I think either one of these cohorts is going to lead to some sort of crisis in the next couple of years.
Right. Okay, now we get to levered consumers, which very well could be a Venn diagram, perhaps of some of these other ones too, because I'm sure there are lots of retirees and millennials that are that are levered.
And now we get into the recent history here economically, right, where we had had a period of very low interest rates, and low as measured by CPI inflation, and then both on a relative basis shot the moon, you know, two years ago.
And households are having to still recover from the after effects of that. And yes, we gave folks stimulus checks and stuff like that. And I'm about to ask you, how much pig is left in that Python? You know, is it all gone? Is there still some there?
But more importantly, while inflation has moderated substantially, right, it's still higher than it was before all this happened. And there's some signs that it still could be a little sticky from here. But probably more importantly, the cost of borrowing has gone up dramatically.
And it's, you know, the Fed is now finally talking the fact that they're planning on rate cuts, but their current guided pace isn't, you know, isn't one of alacrity.
And there's a lot of reasons to think that there are three rate cuts that they've got to the market to this year, may get delayed or may even get pushed, you know, into a future year.
So there's uncertainty around that too. So basically, the longer rates stay up in the vicinity where they are right now, the weight of that higher cost of borrowing weighs on the consumer household.
How concerned, how big of a factor is that?
OK, that is a really good question. And I wish I could give you an exact number. And we're headed towards that in our research. So, you know, what you're seeing us talk about right now is what folks should very likely, if they're interested in this, should follow our research, because this is what we're hoping to kind of nail down.
Like, how many of the retirees, how many of the millennials, what's going on with Gen Z? And really, the beginning of that leverage concern was really twofold last year.
One is the student loans, which I think a lot of folks have kind of chalked up to being like, oh, is it really a big deal that we had to repay these student loans after, you know, 44 months of non-payment?
We still think that it is. We still think that it is a big deal. And there are things that are unfolding even this month, you know, related to student loan repayments that we think are meaningful.
So I'll get back to that in a minute. But that's a pretty decent concern that we have.
And some of that is retirees, believe it or not, you know, parents and others kind of staked their kids in that process. And that's a bit of a concern, right, in terms of like all of a sudden you thought you were going to have to repay the loan and now you do.
And, you know, millennials are less likely to qualify because of income on some of the income-driven repayment plans. It's going to make sense for them just to repay their typically graduate student loans at that point in time and their big chunky payments.
So there you're right. It is a Venn diagram to some extent between retirees and millennials as parents, but they're probably OK to pay.
We're just concerned about this YOLO.
Girl math, you know, sort of spending economy, spending, spending that has occurred over the last year and I don't have the specific number right off the top of my head.
I apologize for not having this, Adam, but I remember looking at the labor market last year and just looking at the sheer number of jobs that were added to the economy for folks between the ages of 20 and 24.
It was substantial relative to the overall reported jobs number. And it just was like, oh, OK, so you basically onboarded a big chunk of the job market, you know, kind of new jobbers out there between the ages of 20 and 24.
And they don't really see themselves having a path forward maybe for owning a home right away, maybe even having to pay their student loans.
How much of this strong economy is just because you've got a bunch of people who are like, yay, giddy, Taylor Swift economy, like, let's go sequencing glitter.
And like, is that sustainable? I don't know. I don't feel like that it is, but it is it.
I'm sure there's a lot of that. And there's probably going to be more of it now for those that own Bitcoin to say.
Or the gambling economy. Right. Right. That's the thing. That's like a real thing. OK, I mean, that is a thing.
All right. And we can we can talk about that, too. But I wonder how much of it, too, is also on the doom spending side, which is sort of the fatalistic effort.
Right. Like, hey, if the future is not going to be fun, I got some cash right now. May as well have a good time today. Right.
Correct. And that works ish, maybe for a while, but we just simply don't have anything in our historical data, not just us.
Like the world doesn't have this in their historical data to say how much of that buy now, pay later mentality.
You know, what's the runway. Right. Of your ability to do that with this new kind of payment method that really isn't captured by a lot of the other kind of aggregated data.
And that's when you go, what do you know? What do you believe? What do you not yet know?
And the not yet know piece, we just simply I don't think we really know the full impact of this buy now pay later.
And I'll give you one quick little example. I don't know if you've done this. I admit that I'm not one to like fully study my credit card statement.
You can just pay the thing and move on. Right. And. You know, I had to go, I think, for like, you know, your HSA spending, I was like, oh, I need to go through and like double check to see this one doctor payment and like see, you know, so I can get my HSA to reimburse me.
Whatever I was doing, like your end HSA adjustments. And I went on my app on my credit card and I was like, oh, my gosh, like right there.
It allows you to say like, oh, hey, this payment I want to I want to extend this payment into payments.
It just offers it to you. And I was like, what? So that that that aha kind of freaked me out a bit because I was like, how many people are looking at this and actually clicking on that button and saying, yeah, I want to extend this payment?
It's just I don't want to sound judgy, but I mean, if that's happening and just being offered and pushed as an idea, why will we be surprised when all of some people can't pay and the delinquencies are going higher and they are going higher?
And we have another chart on that. But, yeah, well, I've said, you know, several times, a number of times on social media that I think one of the most predictable headlines a year from now is how nobody could have seen how by now pay later was going to blow up on everybody.
Right. We do seem to be gamifying it, you know, especially towards the worst audiences, the younger audiences that don't necessarily understand it or can least afford the pain that may cause.
But let's let's put that aside for a second, because I do think that's a symptom. Right. I think I think that's a symptom of some of the issues we have on the leverage side of things.
But let's just take, you know, the average consumer household. But let's let's you know, let's take those millennials as parents. Right.
We've seen credit card debt rocket higher now with the the ending of all the the relief programs from from the stimulus.
And we've seen it. We've seen it rocket higher. We've also seen the rates that debt charges that revolving debt charges rocket higher.
I believe they're at record highs as well. So it's record high debt levels that are being charged record high APRs.
And we are starting to see, I believe, and you might have even just mentioned this, that we're beginning to see delinquencies kick up in consumer debt.
The chart that I've last seen, I'm doing this from memory, so yours may be better. We're beginning to see the credit card delinquencies kick up as well as the auto loan delinquencies kick up.
Not so much yet on mortgages yet, at least. But these are sort of early signs that we would expect to see of the consumer getting trouble.
Yeah, this is the exact chart I was thinking of. So, you know, again, we're seeing the canary maybe, you know, staggering around a little bit there.
This this again, this just this. Oh, and I didn't even mention, you know, the millennials as parents who are now going out to look for a house and home prices haven't come down yet.
Mortgage rates are twice what they were two and a half years ago. Right. So it's not like people just magically have a lot more money to spend to make up for all of that increased cost of debt.
I don't want to see the question, but is there a valid concern here that the increased debt costs are eating away at consumer spending and that we'll see overall consumer spending suffer as a result?
Yes, we do think so. And while weather was blamed, we think January retail sales is somewhat of an indicator of that.
You can see I can quick swing back to that picture. I actually have the January retail sales pulled up over here on the left hand side.
You know, this is the January retail sales deceleration. I mean, that's a pretty market deceleration in the month of January, just like resume.
And you can see right next to it is restaurants, which is a pretty decent proxy for discretionary spending. And that, too, you know, had a pretty significant deceleration.
You know, was it weather? Sure. You know, weather will always get its place and its blame.
But we think when we talk anecdotally to our our pool of contacts and what have you who are decision makers of large companies, absolutely.
There's a belief that there was pretty decent exhaustion or inability to continue to consume because, you know, when you have a higher rate and higher minimum payment and a higher this, that's less capacity for you to spend.
Or, you know, at worst, you know, at best, hopefully it's the shock of seeing the payment going, oh, wow, I actually have to pay this off, you know, and be responsible and do so.
So there. Yes, we think the consumer has definitely been exhausted.
What's not helping and maybe this is jumping ahead a little bit too much, but what's not helping and we actually updated this for your show today.
You're welcome. So this is fresh data is, you know, the tax refund season is not helping. Last year, it was a significant contributor to consumption.
You can see the last year number. This is the the number of refunds had ticked up significantly higher, you know, from kind of 30 million refunds to 35 million refunds in February last year from 22 to 23.
We're back down below the 22 levels in terms of the number of refunds for the first four weeks of the tax season, which is largely covers February.
So not even just the number of refunds were down, but you have 14% fewer refund dollars as well, whereas that had actually been a little bit of a tailwind last year.
It is now actually a headwind to February this year in terms of --
It's so interesting. So we can almost remove the pandemic dip there, right, because it's such an outlier. And if you do, I mean, you see a pronounced trend here of fewer refunds going to people, you know, year over year.
This is what a seven year data series. And not only are the refunds fewer, but the total refund dollars are going down, too. And I just got to ask, I mean, are there any changes in the tax code that could be responsible for this or is this really just a sense that
people are making -- people making less taxable income here? I don't know.
Okay, so I am a total tax nerd, I will tell you. Ironically, I pay a tax attorney to do my taxes, one for business and one for personal, but I love nerdy net on taxes and retail consumption.
And because it actually matters in certain months. And I think if I were to just go, okay, one thing that you can take away from this whole conversation today is consumer spending needs to be thought through the lens of the consumer's experience, not how we see it as observers of the economy.
And this is, I think, can be really, really critical and can be a perspective shifter for 24 for anyone who wants to kind of follow along the bouncing ball of consumption spending.
Let me give you an example. It doesn't matter what CPI is for, you know, whether it's even tracked well or not, for health insurance, car insurance, the consumer experiences that price at renewal.
So they're not thinking about it in March and they're not thinking about it in April, but when they have to go sign up for their annual health care plan at their organization in October, November, that's the day that they have the price shock on what their health care premium is.
And they see it and experience it again on January 1st when they have to pay it out of their paycheck, right? Thinking through the lens of when consumers experience, you know, consumption factors, whether it's price or capacity, that's what really matters in monitoring consumption behavior.
And if I were to sum up my entire career on Wall Street, that is basically where we would win often, right, is when others weren't thinking through that lens of consumer.
Taxes is a great example. Someone could look at this and say, well, this is just February. Is it just a couple billion dollars? Does it really matter? It matters to the consumer because they're experiencing their ability to have a bonus car, an extra appliance.
You know, Whirlpool just laid people off, by the way. They can, you know, have their vacation, right, or possibly their extra tickets, their Taylor Swift tickets. I mean, these are the things that they think through when they think of refunds.
This is my bonus money. This is my bonus extra. And for, you know, 30 million people right now, right? They are not experiencing joy when it comes to refunds, right? They're actually saying, oh, it's lower.
Now, what's interesting, too, if you go back to 2019, do you remember the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act? Do you remember that? OK, so it was signed really late into law in 2017. It went into effect in 2018. And when it went into effect, it was this funny little thing where the withholding tables needed to be adjusted and they weren't adjusted.
And so they ended up basically pre-realizing the tax cuts all throughout 2018. And in 2019, when people went to go file their taxes, they were like, wait, why do I owe? What's going on?
And they're like, well, you basically, you know, there was a whole spin in the Trump administration around like, well, you were benefiting all last year from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, right? But you can see those numbers are like fairly small, like on our chart from 2018 and 2019.
You know, yep, you have fewer refunds, those fewer refund dollars. Now, think through this. You had one of the worst performances in retail sales in spring of 2019. It was horrible. People were just, it was just not good. And we had actually had record reported jobs numbers for January that year as well.
So it'll be really interesting to see how this spring actually rolls out with the trends that we have thus far in February. But March could be better. And so this is why we're not totally fatalistic about the whole thing.
But March last year, what I'm showing you is what the continuation of the season was. It had a huge drop in the number and the number of refunds as well as the amount of refunds because it was a pull forward from March into February. And so this is what we're up against is this big decline.
This kind of twenty five billion dollar decline of tax refund dollars in March last year. So how consumers behave in March this year could be very telling. It's teed up to be immaculate. If it's not, then we then Houston, we have a huge problem for consumer this year.
So we're watching March as much as we're monitoring kind of what's going on in February. March is the month, Adam, to focus on it. The consumer is teed up for total like superior excellence optically.
Their anniversary in the SNAP benefits, their anniversary in SBB, the anniversary in like a really bad headwind in tax refunds. Guess what? Easter's earlier. It's all in March this year versus being somewhat over into April last year. The tee up is immaculate for consumer.
If March consumer retail sales are horrible, you all need to pack up your bags and go find somewhere else to invest. Right. Because it is it's it's not going to be a good sign. So we're watching March.
Wow. Okay. Of course, we won't know the March data until when? April, April, mid April, mid April. Okay. All right. So I've got so many questions. I am cognizant that we didn't get to the second half of your chart from the start, which is super important because it's it seemed to really wander into the job side of things.
Do you want to pull that up real quick and just explain the rubric and then we can get into the specific jobs numbers? Yeah.
These are the three primary conversations going on in C-suites. You know, as we move from being a consumer centric economy, which we are, we are also now being mindful of being a profit centric company.
And this is where I think you're going to start to see labor normalization. If I were to summarize a lot of our conversations, it's that there's an acknowledgement that labor hoarding existed. I mean, that's not a new concept out there. But I would say that's definitely confirmed in a lot of our conversations with C-suite leaders.
But as they are navigating forward with, you know, what are all the tools, you know, check GPT being probably one emblematic of all the other AI things to be considered, they're reevaluating their tasks, they're reevaluating their labor structures, their overall levels of people, you know, had a conversation very recently with a company where they just went through a reduction force.
And really, it was around removing duplicate layers, you know, of just, they just got themselves to be too layered up.
Yep, the accreted bloat and bureaucracy of corporations. Yeah. So they're just, and their ability to make swifter decisions with more impact is better. And that is, that's great. I love that for the longer term of our companies. I don't like it when we lose jobs, but I do love it that we have companies that will endure.
And that is, with that, too, becomes this whole physical space evaluation, I think, as they're trying to, this whole return to office dynamic, I think is really interesting, because I think it has more to do with figuring out what leases you needed to re-up versus, you know, actually fully meeting people back in their seats.
And I'm just curious, what are you finding there right now? Or is the pendulum swinging back towards working office? Or are they, is it really, it's a hybrid world, and we just need to find the optimal divide between home and office?
You know, it's, I've had a lot of conversations on this topic in the last 30 days with decision makers. And I would say, from my vantage point, it's sitting somewhere around, look, we don't want to lose the ability to be flexible.
You know, it's important for people if they feel like they need to go, you know, work from home for a day to kind of run their laundry or do something with their kid or, you know, whatever it is.
We want to be a place that honors that. However, presence, physical presence absolutely matters. You know, decisions, difficult decisions need to be made when people are looking at the whites of the eyes of one another.
And I think that that is, that also has a role and a place. But nobody wants to be recalled back to office or to just look like a desolate wasteland of cubicles either.
So I think the decision makers are trying to figure out what does that look like and what are those cultural expectations that we can reasonably put into place without losing our best talent.
And it's complicated. I mean, this is a hill we'll die on. The case studies that will still yet to be written on the breaking of the contract of employment, you know, the kind of the cultural contract of employment in April of 2024 when we fired 24 million people overnight
and declared some people essential and other people not essential. We will be feeling the effects of this for decades. It will, you know, it was, it's very interesting to me.
And that's basically because it taught, I mean, all workers, but I'm going to guess more younger generations of workers, that there is no corporate loyalty, right? When the chips are down, they're just going to drop you like a hot potato, right?
And so they're much more skeptical about, do I ever really want to fully commit to a company going forward knowing that they don't have my back?
Yes. And that makes me sad. I mean, I think work is beautiful, right? I think the ability to go and create something and do it in community with one another is just a phenomenal thing.
So I think those who figure out how to restore the vibrancy of that while honoring human dignity along the way, those are the people who are going to win. But it's forever fractured. And this is where case studies will be written even decades from now.
Yeah, okay. And yeah, I mean, COVID was an event like the Great Depression where it just shapes a mindset and that mindset doesn't change until those generations pass on decades in the future.
All right, so I want to get to your data around what's currently happening in the jobs world. But real quick before you go, I want to ask sort of a higher level question, which is,
we have been providing, even far pre-COVID, what I call a malincentive to corporations to employ as few people as possible. The price of employing humans has just gotten more and more expensive as time has gone on.
And then now, for a long time, we were giving them practically free debt to go out and invest in automation and offshoring and all that stuff. Now we have the AI boom, which is making the siren song even sweeter. Oh my goodness, I can eventually get rid of whole departments.
I'm blanking on the company, but I just saw an article yesterday touting one company that basically did a side by side test with its new AI, with its customer service department, and the AI is doing a better job with more accounts at a much lower cost basis.
So that's kind of being tattered out there now. It's like, hey, that's right. Hey, if you're in corporate America, AI, if you're a manager, it's going to be your best friend. If you're an employee, it's painting a big target on your back. So where I'm going with this is,
regardless of what we're about to talk about, about what's happening in the employment market right now,
is there indeed, I know maybe it's one of those elephants that in the room that people don't necessarily want to give voice to, but I mean, are we facing a coming era of
massive labor dishoarding because companies are just deciding, I don't need it anymore. And you were talking about the company that removed its bloat. Yeah, I mean,
when you cost cut, you look for the easy cuts first, but I'm talking not just in a downturn tomorrow, I'm talking about next 10, 20 years. Is it just going to be harder and harder? Will the power be shifting more and more to the company and less and less to the employee because frankly, they just don't need you unless you're a true specialist?
Yes. And I think about this often because I am also a professor. And I'm about to launch, you know, classes.
And, you know, I can get a little sassy sometimes as a professor, I think with that professional lens on. And thankfully, I have the trust of my students. But, you know, just recently at a student, we did these kind of end of classroom participation or presentations on a topic.
And I had a student just kind of say to me, granted is end of the day, I'm sure they were tired. And this is not emblematic of their character. But someone just kind of said, Do we have to stand up to do these presentations?
And I just shot back out of them. And I said, if you think you can charge $1,000 an hour by sitting down, go ahead, sit down. Right. You know, it was just, it was just, you know, just getting prepared to deal with what it is to step out and look different than everyone else.
And you can see it even in the internship flow. So I think I live in this two different worlds right now on internships, as well as on just friends. Yeah, I do. I'm going to say this right now. I have been in paper, in print, I do believe that we're going to have the job losses that we are currently seeing the restructuring that we're currently seeing is not reactive restructuring.
I think there's a lot of things that people are like, well, where are the claims data? Like, where are these big layoffs you're thinking of and you're going to see, Nealey? I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, they're going to be extremely surgical and permanent.
Like, it's not coming back. That is the concern that we have.
And so, I mean, that's my concern. And I feel like Elon Musk really showed the way, at least in big tech, where he basically amputated 75% of the staff of Twitter and companies still alive and by a lot of stats doing better than ever, right?
It just really caused companies to wake up and say, whoa, I got to maybe just reevaluate what a critical employee is because this guy just got rid of three quarters of his workforce and he's still around.
I think he was secretly the envy of almost every tech CEO the day that he did that because they realized what they had to do. And I was just on the phone. I mean, just before we did this, I was doing a group of other consultants that we chat with and kind of share notes on about the conversations we're having.
And he does more operations. And, you know, he was sharing with me that a role, kind of seven tenure type experience role, software engineer, they're getting hundreds of applicants in the Midwest, in the Midwest, like, you know, Green Bay area, right?
To work in some of these roles. And I mean, in the past would have been like, can you fog a mirror? We want to hire you.
I mean, so this is where we go with the data does not reflect. You know, I'm not here to call to cast stones on saying like it's some big conspiracy and why the data is doing what it's doing.
I have a theory as to why the data has been inconsistent, I think, with what reality is. But, you know, it is not at all what we're seeing or experiencing in the job market and those that we talk with.
I think that we have an imbalance and which is why I think people feel maybe less optimistic about their future because they're seeking for something new or different and they are not finding it as they go and get some of these jobs.
All right. I'm going to ask you to perhaps restate that because I think I want to make this the lead teaser coming into this video. I think I hear you saying that the data that you see on the job market does not match this incredibly robust
jobs market that we keep hearing about month after month, that there's way more openings than applicants and anybody who wants a job can get a job. Sounds like you're saying it's a lot harder out there than we're being told.
We do. We think that it is more difficult to find a job than what is perceived in the positive press around the labor market.
Whether it's at the entry level on internships, you know, internships are not feeling the way that they have historically right now, or even available as they have been historically.
That's a leading indicator. You know, several different C-suite conversations we've had around those looking for that seven to 10-year experience sort of cohort of employee are finding significant supply for very little demand.
It just feels a bit off, Adam.
OK, great. Not great that it is, but great that you clarified for us. All right. So this is the segue into whatever employment data you want to go through.
I'm looking forward to whatever you have, but I think you might have some info on payroll tax data, too.
But OK, so we've got this macro trend over the coming decades of, hey, you know, there's just maybe going to be fewer jobs per capita out there that we've been used to in the past because of all these new technologies that are replacing real humans.
Sadly, that means it's probably going to become more competitive market. I feel badly about that because I also feel like, present company aside, I'm not sure education system is doing as good of a job as preparing college students and high school students for the job market that it used to.
And so it's kind of a double whammy, right, where you're less prepared going into a harder market. OK, so that's the macro picture. Now, in the here and now, what are we seeing?
And like I think it's true to say, hey, it's not as rosy a story as we're being told. And I'm anecdotally in my life seeing the same things you are, Nealey, where I'm seeing people who are very qualified candidates who got laid off or who are graduating from well-respected universities
and getting out in this market and saying, everyone's telling me that they're just giving away jobs, but I'm finding it really hard. So what is the jobs data telling us right now?
And this is why I don't have the jobs charts for you. It would just perpetuate, I think, what is inaccurate at this point. You're certainly incongruent with what our experiences have been on the anecdotal side. And that is, it optically appears to be good jobs, good wages, low unemployment.
But this is not new. This is not our idea. But we ascribe to this the accounting of the jobs through both lower participation rates on the survey data that are coming in through the BLS that certainly we believe has made the data a little bit less reliable.
In addition, you have just the seasonal adjustments. Much has been made about the seasonal adjustments or through the birth deaths adjustments in the data. And we agree with that concern about whether or not you're having good and accurate data.
And I provide this visual to think through what happens with seasonal adjustments. I mean, again, when you fire 24 million people overnight, that's going to throw somebody's model off.
You're going to underestimate what those jobs are in the subsequent years, and then you're going to end up overestimating on the whipsaw of the normalization or the effect. I almost think of it like a data point that sits at the tail, the end of a tail of a dog.
And as it whips back and forth, you have wilder swings on the seasonal adjustments. And that's what's happening with the data from our vantage point.
And I need to make this clear, because I think sometimes we have animosity. I have friends at the BLS. I genuinely enjoy the people at the BLS as friends, and they're extremely helpful when I have questions around clarity with them.
These are good people. I want to deal with this with dignity. I just think the structure of how they're calibrating and calculating the data is off because we had a once in a lifetime type event that have caused their systems to be off.
Got it. It's sort of a variant of the bullwhip effect where you get unexpected volatility, and so you overreact to it, and that creates even greater distortions.
So I guess you're nodding as I'm saying this. Does that, and again, no aspersions to your friends at the BLS, but does that just mean that their models just aren't useful right now?
Yes.
If we're pilot, and that's our altimeter, we can't trust it, so we got to be looking out the window. When you're looking out the window, what are you seeing that gives you indications of where the job is marketed? What's the type of data that you're looking at here?
So we are thinking and monitoring through other means. You've alluded to this, the daily treasury statement is a great place to be hanging out and looking at some of the data.
The reason why we like the daily treasury statement, every once in a while, Adam, people are like, "What's one topic you could talk about for 10 minutes without stopping?"
I'm like, "Me?" The daily treasury statement, and all of it's in many uses to someone who observes the economy.
You've got 10 minutes, let's go. You've got 10 minutes here, sister.
Okay, I won't do it in 10 months, but I will say that it's a great document because it's high frequency. You get it every single day. It's cash in, cash out on the economy.
You do need to not use it without some expertise and caution because the way that payment flows happen can differ based on days of the week can matter on this analysis, not just days.
So sometimes I see people will do, "Oh, well, this is what the month of..." Tax refunds is a good example. "This is what the month of the tax refunds are." Well, you can't compare a Wednesday month end versus a Tuesday month end because actually if you look at the pattern of when tax refunds are paid out, they're paid out on Wednesdays.
So you kind of need to go level it up day of the week to day of the week. So you can't use it willy-nilly. You have to kind of know what you're doing with it, but it's extremely informative.
And on the tax receipts, they have generally speaking been positive this year versus last year. It's hard to fully know, though, in some of the tax receipt data how much of that is bonus related or wage related.
So we don't have the number of people getting paid. So you have to make some assessments and adjustments in that data about what you think is actually wage increases versus number of people increase or bonus related.
So we don't put a ton of stock in the tax receipt data until you get through the first quarter because of all those different things that can happen.
But one thing we did notice is that the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, the FUTA taxes, which are measured and monitored by us very closely in payroll taxes.
So not tax withholdings, but payroll taxes paid by businesses. They were very strong in January. They ended up being really strong.
They actually started out really weak, which was kind of interesting and almost like maybe payroll wasn't doing this wrong.
And then at the very end, they had some big payouts in January. But what we think is going on there is you have states like California and I think New York is the other one where they had been underfunded in their payroll taxes.
And so they kind of have to cause their companies to pay more in payroll taxes. They have less of a discount.
So it gets really technical as to why that is. But when you think about that, like if they're underfunded, then does that mean that they've been unable from a state level deficit perspective?
Can they, you know, like you start going, wait, are the states healthy? So then you start thinking about local government health.
Oh, I live in California. I can answer that question for you. For us at least. No. What is it? What is it? They're not, right? I mean, they're running deficits.
Not at all here. Yeah.
So I think that's the next wave of this that we're kind of thinking through from a labor perspective is how much labor has also been held by local governments, by colleges and universities,
right? That might need the right size on the other side of COVID stimulus, which that's really the last. You asked about stimulus earlier.
The last kind of hanging on of stimulus is really been in the education space and all of that stimulus money is like done at this point.
And they were kind of the last wave of it. And you're starting to see, unfortunately, more and more school districts come under significant pressure because they're on the other side of lower enrollments.
Therefore, they're not getting some of the additional federal funds and the stimulus payments are going away. So you're going to see a reckoning very likely in the education space from K through 12 all the way up through higher ed on post stimulus this year.
And that is super sad. It is sad. But at the end of the day, and this is for a different interview entirely, I think we're doing all this deficit spending.
And of course, everybody comes up to the trough and wants as much as they can get at the end of the day to be sustainable.
You have to largely live within your means. We've probably been overspending for way too long. And we're going to have to get to the point where we're going to have to make the hard choices of what are the programs we really value and what are the ones that we don't.
And maybe everybody's going to get less, but some are going to get a lot less versus the ones who really need to feed.
Personally, I think education should be really high at that list. And then we should also be asking ourselves what return are we getting on for that spending.
And sadly, I don't think those hard decisions get made in advance. I think they get made in response to lots of pain. So you're nodding because I'm saying this, which scares me because I'm always looking for the optimistic out to my concerns.
But okay, so you walked us through a bit what's happening there with the payroll tax receipts. But punchline, what are you seeing right now? Are we still doing okay? Are you seeing declining trends?
Because what I like about the Treasury data, as you were saying, it sounds like there's some methodology you're going to get familiar with, but it's not like a BLS model where there are birth death assumptions or CPI where you've got hedonics or all that stuff.
It's just, hey, this is what was paid. So what are you taking away from that?
Overall, okay. I don't think it's as robust as what the January jobs number suggested. And we'll see, you know, later this week, depending on when this airs, right, what the February jobs number is.
But we don't think it's as robust as what the BLS numbers are suggesting. The clearer picture for the tax receipts will be on the other side of March because there's a lot of noise in the data that occurs in the first quarter.
So I'm just trying to say, like, it looks okay, but it doesn't tell you always the full story.
And, you know, in the meanwhile, I think what cuts through all of that noise is it kind of doesn't matter what it is right now. It matters what it will be.
And that's where I think having these tactical conversations of reducing bloat, restreamlining the way that decisions are made, being thoughtful about bringing in interns to first hires, right, that's that slowdown in the hiring rate is where you'll see that really probably before you see the layoffs.
And I think that is clear that we're starting to see that slowdown in the hiring rate, even in the deficiency of the JOLTS data, you're seeing that, you know, kind of come through.
And that is the leading, that would be the leading indicator out of the jobs data is more the slowing down of the hiring before you actually get to the layoffs.
And that's evident. I would be shocked if someone's actually debating that point at this point.
Okay. So just to sort of put a pin on that, it sounds like you're saying you're seeing leading indicators that make you think that the jobs market is going to be tightening.
And maybe that's even a kind way to say tightening could be just getting more efficient tightening could be Oh, gosh, we're getting to something we're worried about time will tell.
I got so many other topics I want to talk about with you, but we're getting short on time, obviously, the housing market being one of them.
I was really hoping, but we might need to save it for next time, because it's such a big topic, which is the wealth gap. And this, you know, I know you said it's much more of a patchwork quilt style of consumer segments.
But I think you can draw a line across many of those segments and put a few on one side and a lot on the other in terms of who's benefiting from the majority of the fruits of the bounty here in the national economy.
And just like some of the concerns you had about preparing students for maybe we're not preparing them as well as they need to, you know, we're not preparing them fully for the challenges that they're going to be facing the tougher world they're going to be facing.
I think nothing good comes from sort of this corrosive concentration of wealth into fewer and fewer households going forward. You're nodding as I'm saying this, maybe we'll squeeze some of this in.
But let me try to get to the punch line, which is, I see a lot of data that I talk about on this channel, and I have definitely had lots of conversations with a number of the guests who have a, you know, they're concerned about where things are headed.
This is largely those that are predicting recession and stuff like that. I'm hearing from you, I'm not hearing a lot of alarm from you right now about the state of the consumer and therefore the state of the consumer driven economy.
I'm hearing some caution, but not alarm. You know, what do you want people to leave here with in terms of their understanding through your lens of where the economy is likely to go for the rest of this year?
And if in your answer, you can kind of give us a nod to what recession odds you project. Are you in the soft landing camp, the no landing camp, the hard landing camp? Yeah, I'm not gonna ask you to predict a time or anything like that, but just sort of a risk threat level.
Here's what I'm comfortable, how I'm comfortable responding to that. With what we can see and what I believe is largely predictable out of most consumption behavior, we're going to muddle along. Okay? We're going to muddle along.
There's two caveats we make to that from our vantage point. Number one is we don't know really what the runway is for the leopard consumers. I'm going to try to tackle that in our research this year to try to put more rigor behind how to kind of think through that that runway.
But right here, right now, I don't think it exists. I haven't seen the analysis that passes the rigor test on really understanding what that runway is on the leopard consumer.
And it's more than a million people, right? I mean, we're talking probably, if I had to guess off the top of my head, we're talking like probably 20 millionish to 30 millionish sort of consumers that have some sort of touching on this overleveraged dynamic in some form or fashion.
So we really want to know what that runway is. We don't know. We're in the process of attempting to try to quantify that. So that's the first unknown.
Similarly, there is a second major unknown, which we really didn't talk about, but I think you've talked about it with other speakers, is how many businesses are also overlevered?
With the corporate debt wall. I was just going to go here.
So if I were to say, like, why are you concerned about that, Nealey? Because I had breakfast with the head of a consumer, like a community bank, obviously won't name names, and I asked the question.
Would your lenders know who within your loan portfolio received the employer retention tax credit? Like, you would know if you saw the PPP loans, right? Or the EIDL loans. The banks would know about that.
But would you actually know if any of your business owners received the employer retention tax credit? And you thought about it for a minute and he was like, I'm not sure we would.
And so I just am wondering how much lending has happened over the last, call it 20 months, 22 months, you know, prior to when that program was shut down in July, where the optics of the ability to kind of spend was just a little bit of a mirage on the cash, too.
And how many people have been overextended? Maybe it's a million businesses. Maybe it's 13 million businesses. I don't know. But there were 400 billion dollars extended into the EIDL loan program.
The economic disaster loans, essentially, which were kind of the subprime-iest businesses of which they employ, geez, I think they were, yeah, I think it was like four to five million people that they employed across, you know, the 400 billion dollars of loans that were there.
And that would be pretty substantial if, you know, some of these folks were unable to pay back some of their loans. So we're just we're thinking through that piece as well.
Like, what's the runway in the consumer? What's the runway on those businesses on kind of the subprime consumers and the subprime sort of businesses? And where is that that point going to happen?
Because that is what could end up kind of cratering, you know, the economy and declare the landing.
Yeah. And what's so interesting is I don't necessarily see them as being completely siloed from one another either.
Right. So if the overleveraged consumers start tapping out, their spending drops, that then tightens the screws even harder on these overleveraged corporations.
They then have to lay off people to cut costs and the cycle, you know, continues down the way that it does heading into recession.
You're nodding as I'm saying all this. OK, I'm curious. Does one of those two keep you up more at night?
Really? Let me ask this. Let me give it a trial balloon out there. So we've got 20 to 30 million people you're guesstimating fit into the overleveraged consumer group.
But all companies are facing higher debt maturity re-ratings as we go on, as long as long as rates stay this high. Right.
And some companies have more cash and the ability to get better rate terms and others and whatnot.
But pretty much the entire corporate fleet is going to have less to spend in the future as its old debts roll over at higher rates.
Yes. I would say we probably think more about the corporate side of what is the unknown that would concern us more because of that.
And because it's actually what we know least about, I think, in terms of can you get the data that you need on that group of people and what that impact is?
And I think it's just more disparate. I think that's the concern that we have. It's just more disparate to figuring out those subprime type businesses that won't be able to weather that storm versus the consumer piece.
That's a little bit more. You have the ability to kind of know that better and see that even earlier.
So I think it's what we don't know that concerns us the most. I mean, I remember Danielle DiMartino Booth at the end of, gosh, she was in an interview at the end of, I think, 22, so December 22.
And I had the privilege of asking her this question on Twitter space around X space around what concerns her the most.
And she said, you know, private credit just went to places it didn't belong. And that statement from her has probably been tattooed.
It lives rent free in my head. I mean, it lives rent free in my head. And I think about it often.
She's a wise woman. And I think about that phrase often when we're navigating data.
OK, got it. So I'm going to have to wrap it up here, but really great topic. Great conversation. What I'm taking away from you is if neither one of those cohorts really stumbles, at least this year, you kind of muddle through.
I think were your words, which is, hey, it's not going to be necessary gangbusters, but it's not going to be that terrible.
Right. The Uber bears will probably not be vindicated here. We're probably going to get through it.
OK. But of course, we've got to watch those danger areas like a hawk. So I'm curious of the data sets you currently already have.
So I know you're working on building even better ones, but the ones you currently have, what are you going to be watching most closely to see if either one of those two danger zones starts getting into trouble?
That's a great question. One would be on of course, we're going to watch the tax receipts, like particularly on the other side of the March 31 date when the noise becomes less and tax refunds.
I would say that is when I'm thinking through the lens of companies and how they buy their goods and where they get their confidence, if they have a really great march with really great reads on their business, they're going to be able to buy intelligently about what those demand curves are for the balance of the year and probably procure a tremendous amount of like fuller price margin through those early reads.
If March ends up being a bust, I think it's like a game over on consumption for the year.
I don't mean to be a fatalist about it, but yeah, no, I think March is going to end up being a very critical month.
And this is just the 20 years of the sell side analyst in me coming out with just understanding that pattern and that behavior of what matters when you start to make the decisions.
So March is going to be a critical month because of all the different things that should go right. And if they don't, it's a problem.
And then when you said about the data sets, I think even in the reported data, however flawed it may be, we're obviously watching for some of the JOLTS data around not just the job openings, but the hiring rates, the other separations.
And then also we're looking very closely at things like multiple job holders as being somewhat of an interesting leading indicator, especially relative to continuing claims.
We've created our own metric around that, and it kind of gives you a sense of why people are stretching for multiple jobs while also the continuing claims, if it extends, they can't reabsorb basically workers into the workplace.
And so looking at those two together is kind of a unique metric that we're looking at right now.
Okay. So anyways, Nealey, we will drop whatever we're doing in April. If the March data comes out and it's in the game over phase, let us know, come back on and we'll talk about that.
Sorry.
All right.
I hope it's not.
Yeah, look, we all hope it's not.
I hope it's not.
All right. Well, look, for folks that have enjoyed this discussion, and maybe this is their first exposure to you and they'd like to follow you and your work from here on out.
Where should they go?
I get to hang out with you on the platform of X. So @NealeyTaminga is the handle. It's a name you can't hide from, so it's cool.
The great name.
And also, you can find us also on our, we have a new data platform we launched, and you can go to iq.distilladvisory.com or just our website, distilladvisory.com and click over to it.
It's a fun database where you can just upload whatever data set that you want and just click a few buttons and it tells you what in the economy correlates with that data set.
So it's a cool little diagnostic tool that we've created. And yeah, it's been fun. It's fun to build something.
Right. All right. So I will put up the URLs to those resources when I edit this, Nealey, and hopefully all the data hounds go over to your website and start playing around with that tool.
All right. I'm going to ask you one last question. I'm going to do a little bit of housekeeping beforehand, so you've got 45 seconds to think about this.
We've been talking a lot about money issues, but been asking a lot of folks in the program recently, what's one non-monetary investment that you would encourage the viewers here to consider adopting in their lives?
This is a little bit more of sort of like a life wisdom and we've gotten all sorts of great answers to date.
So while you're thinking about yours, real quick, folks, if you enjoyed having Nealey on the program, like the deep dive into the consumer space and want to see more of it,

You can pocket $35. I just want you to get the best value, the lowest price that you can lock in.
All right, Nealey. Oh, real quick. So muddle through economy here unless some of these shoes drop that Nealey and I are concerned about drop.
For the average investor trying just to sort of make sense on how to invest through all this. I know we didn't get into the market so much here.
But at the end of the day, consumers, their number one goal is to build wealth and protect it from the ravages of inflation.
And you want to make sure that you, unless you're a really experienced DIY investor, which I think most investors, regular retail investors are not.
I myself like Nealey, tax expert, but uses a CPA for her own taxes. I have a financial advisor who manages my accounts.
Highly recommend that most people watching this video work under the guidance of a good professional financial advisor who takes into account
all the macro issues that Nealey and I talked about and that all our other guests on this channel talked about as well.
If you've got a good one, great, stick with them. But if you don't have one who's already doing that for you,
or you'd like a second opinion of a good one that meets those criteria, consider scheduling a free consultation with the financial advisors
that Thoughtful Money endorses. You see them on this channel with me every week. You go do that, just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com,
fill out the very short form there. Again, these consultations are totally free. There's no commitment to work with these guys.
It's just a free public service they offer to help as many people as possible make as prudent positioning decisions as possible today
versus what might be coming tomorrow. And with that, Nealey, now we're back to you. What non-money related investment would you
encourage folks to consider?
For me, every morning, before I let my feet hit the ground, I actually go through a whole process of prayer in the morning.
Whether it's investing the time to just pause and meditate, for me, it expresses as prayer. I just think it's incredibly important to be
daily grounded that the world needs us, that we matter, but that we're not the center of things.
I think that that, for me, has been really critical, that tension of mattering and having importance, but not significance
based on my outcomes or even my identity. For me, prayer does it. Time is an investment, and that is a morning practice that I believe heavily in.
That's great. I will say, you're the first one to mention this, and I'm really glad that you did. It's all about getting your head right
and your heart right before you attack the day. It's like orienting your compass before you actually head out on your journey.
I talk a lot about Internet's full of interviews of people who live to be 100, and they ask them what matters in life.
They all pretty much say the same three things. I've been mentioning this a lot because people keep bringing up relationships
and health, which are two of the three things that they mention. But the other thing that they mention is purpose,
is that my life mattered in some way. It's like a key nutrient that if you don't have in your life, it's really hard to feel fulfilled by it.
Again, you've got to figure out what your mission is before you can go out and pursue it. The daily check-in that you're talking about,
I think, is just very essential to that. That's something I know you work with younger people in your professorship role.
That's something that I think social media has really taken away from a lot of kids, is the sense of mission and purpose,
because there's so much comparison to other people out there that there's not the introspection of,
"Hey, who am I? What matters to me? What do I want to be a part of with my life story?"
As a result, I think it's a not insignificant contributor to the depression and anxiety that we see in these younger cohorts.
I think it's because they largely have a lack of purpose in their lives. That's one man's opinion.
Agreed.
All right. Well, Nili, thank you again for coming on, for giving us so much time.
Again, we're going to sit here on tinterhooks, waiting to see what happens with the March data.
When it comes in, please let us know. If it's something that really changes your outlook, then come back on the program and tell us in detail.
You betcha. Thank you so much, Adam. Appreciate you.
Real pleasure, Nili. Appreciate you too. Everyone else, thanks so much for watching.
Thanks for watching.
Thank you.
