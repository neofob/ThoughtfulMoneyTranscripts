Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. It's a tough time to be
an investor. There are cross currents galore in the macro data, the financial headlines, policy
decision making, and market technicals. After the easy decade that followed the great financial
crisis where markets dependably churned higher year after year and you could make money just
going along pretty much any stock or ETF and "buying the dips" along the way, suddenly it's
taking a lot more hard work to earn a good return. What are the keys to investing success in today's
more uncertain environment? Well, for guidance, we're fortunate to talk with Andy Konstan,
founder of the macro economic research firm Damped Spring. His work there builds on his
earlier tenure at elite firms like Salomon Brothers, Bridgewater, and Brevin Howard. Andy,
thanks so much for joining us today. Pleasure, Adam. Looking forward to the conversations.
Great. Same here. Well, thank you so much for coming on the program. This is the first time
that I've had the pleasure of interviewing you, so thank you. Looking forward to this as well.
I got a lot of questions here largely based on a lot of your recent work, Andy. Real quick though,
before we get to those, let me just start with a general question I like to ask at the beginning
of all these discussions. What's your current assessment of the global economy and financial
markets? Yeah, sure. Let's start with the economy. I think it's
important to recognize the various differences in the global economy. It's not a global economy that
is in sync across the regions, and that has a lot to do, I think, with the reaction during and after
COVID in each of the various countries along with their regular differences in dynamics, but in
particular the response to COVID and subsequently, which put the U.S. recovering more robustly,
quicker, more inflationary. Then as you go east, Europe was less inflationary and less stimulative,
but also stimulative, so they recovered relatively quickly. Then when you get out to Asia,
China and Japan were notably absent in terms of their fiscal response and their monetary response
to COVID, and they have lagged. I think we're well past the supply disruption portion of COVID.
That was transitory, was going to be transitory. The Ukraine war put a bit more oomph into that
action, particularly for Europe, but we're long past that. The things going on in the Red Sea
are once again potentially supply disruption related and could cause inflation to bounce
on the supply side. But what hasn't been yet resolved is where inflation will settle, and
now that the supply side transitory phase is over, now we're into where will we land.
I've been describing three different islands, recession island, soft landing island,
and higher for longer island, and for almost 18 months now. Well, it's even longer than that,
probably 20 months now, and I've always been a resider on higher for longer island because
I didn't see the potential weakening economic growth that many on recession island found.
But what I have been surprised about and been wrong lately in particular in the last two to
three months is the market sense that in the United States at least, we will successfully
execute a soft landing, which in my way of thinking is limited to no job loss and inflation
returning to target. And the data is heading in those directions. So I get why markets are
pricing that type of soft landing occurring. I'm just still very uncertain whether it will
actually occur. And betting on a soft landing at this stage in markets seems to be a bad risk
return bet. And is that because you think, how much of that is because you think markets may be
wrong, that it might not be a soft landing overall, and how much of that is due to current levels of
market valuation where they're just quite elevated? Well, I mean, I think about the levels is the
consensus. That's where investors have placed their chips and buyers and sellers have met.
And so the buyers have decided that there's a soft landing and the sellers have said,
well, maybe not, but at this level, we're not going to bet on that. And so I think it's mostly
about market pricing. I don't think there's any additional certainty just because we're,
I like to think of this in the metaphors, closer to the runway, whether we're going to slam hard
into that runway, land and taxi to the gate, or have to touch and run and go off the other end of
the runway for another trip around. And so I'm just not sure where we are in that phase. And
maybe that's my failure, but I know where the market is. And so to me, it's a matter of making
a risk reward bet on what the outcomes could be. And if I lose 500 basis points by saying
over cash, by saying a soft landing isn't going to occur and assets make 10% this year,
bonds, stocks, gold, a portfolio of assets make 10% this year, and I make 5% on my one-year bill,
I'm okay with that because the downside is quite a bit more.
Right. Right. And the downside in the one-year bill is zero. You get to sleep really well at
night. All right. So great entry. Let me ask you a couple of questions about your framework
that I want to actually get into inflation a bit. When you talk about these islands,
recession island, South Landing Island and higher for longer island,
is the recession island the hard landing island?
Yes. Yes. That's when the economy either, when real growth goes to well below trend
and unemployment rises. Okay. So just help me understand on your higher for longer island
that lag effects don't eventually get us to recession island.
Yeah. So, I mean, I think that's the trick, right? You have to think about what is going
to cause inflation, what the cycles of the economy are likely to be and economies go
through cycles. And this economy here is going to be a slightly different cycle than ones in the
past, but it's going to have cycles. And so the question is, we've come from a period of very high
real growth and very high inflation driven by strong demand from government passing on money to
the economy through spending and which was monetized by the Fed and supply chain disruptions.
And so normally, if inflation never had that supply disruption, the question is,
would we be in a classic cycle where then in an expansionary inflationary environment?
And the things that would result in the next cycle of a inflationary expansionary cycle are high cost
of long-term debt, which makes individual next real projects more expensive and levering up.
And that levering up causes eventually people expecting higher real growth than actually occurs,
which causes these projects to fail and the marginal new levered up player to start cutting,
which causes a reduction in demand, which causes a reduction in somebody else's income,
which causes firings, and that's how an inflationary expansionary cycle turns into a
deflationary recession. And so if it wasn't for the supply chain disruption, who knows where we'd
be, but that would be a normal cycle coming from an inflationary expansionary experience.
And what determines the depth of each of those things at some level is monetary and fiscal
responses. And so we can succeed to have a normalization to normal growth and normal
inflation without a deflationary recession, but it's just very rare and requires a significant
amount of good fortune, and that includes global influences and well-tuned monetary and fiscal
policy. And to me, though, given the size of the economy and the amount of dislocation that's
occurred over this last three to five years, three to four years, it's just a very hard thing for
these policymakers to get right. And so to the extent that they overdo spending and under do
tightening, you end up with a higher for longer environment. At some point, they recognize that
they have been unsuccessful in causing this inflationary expansion to slow and they take
additional steps. And that's really been the story of the last 18 months. The Fed has continued to
raise rates, but unfortunately, fiscal has continued to pump money. And so the effects of
the tightening have been felt less than they otherwise would have if fiscal had been a bit
more austere. And so they haven't gotten it right yet, and they've gotten it right wrong on the
stronger real growth side than anybody certainly that was living on recession island expected.
But ultimately, if they have a, and this is a question, if the policymakers, which particularly
in this cycle includes fiscal policymakers, have an objective to bring this inflationary high NGDP
economy back into trend NGDP, there's more work to be done. And it may not be the Fed,
it may have to be on fiscal, and fiscal may not have any interest in doing that,
which would mean that we'd last longer in a higher for longer environment, certainly then markets are
priced. Okay. So I think if I'm understanding this correctly, then that your higher for longer
scenario is sort of something I've been flagging for a while here, which is we've had at least
right up until the last Fed meeting, the Fed really working hard to jam on the monetary breaks
on the economy. All right, we're going to tighten, we're going to hike rates, we want to slow things
down. But you've had the fiscal side jamming on the economic accelerator at the same time,
right? So you're kind of burning the engine to a certain extent, but that's what's been
keeping things going stronger for longer, we'll say, than the recession island folks thought.
So it sounds like that's sort of your higher for longer scenario is when that's still going on.
And I guess I want to maybe trundle into the policy side of things, which is
presumably that being at odds like that can't last forever. And maybe the Fed is blinking here,
which a lot of people were surprised by Powell's last press conference. But I guess the
question is, I want to ask how long can you continue to have those sort of monetary and
fiscal forces be at odds? But maybe the better question is just what do you see happening going
forward policy-wise, both on the monetary side and the fiscal side?
Right. So I think what we now know about the Fed is that they are thinking about a lot of things.
And let me enumerate the things. Firstly, the most important thing that they have said from
the get-go is that their preferred tool for monetary policy is the short-term interest rate.
And so they've described QT, which is another lever that they have currently pulled,
as operating in the background and largely priced in to when it was announced back in early 2022.
And so we have the particular lever that they are focused on is the short-term interest rate.
And they've made it very clear, though the market seems to have
woken up to this idea when Waller spoke in early December, they have made it clear for
15 months prior when they wrote their first SEP that described the path of the economy
that they expected, the slowing of inflation, the falling of the increase in unemployment,
and the slowing of real GDP, and that that would lead to a rate cut in 2024 and further cuts in
2025. And it all came crystal clear to markets when Waller spoke, but it had been reiterated
prior to that by Powell and by each SEP, each dot plot. And that is that for a given level of
monetary policy, let's say they have a restrictive agenda, for that restrictive rate, they have a
rate, it's some premium to their completely theoretical R-star, and they have a rate and
they'd like to keep it at that rate and stay restrictive for as long as they view the need
to be restrictive. And then when inflation comes down, in order to stay similarly restrictive,
real interest rates, you have to cut the nominal rate. And that's been in the SEP from the get-go.
And last June, it was at 100 basis points of cuts in 2024. In September, it was at 50 basis points
of cuts in 2024. And now it's at 75 basis points of cuts in 2024. And it's all just the same Taylor
rule that as inflation falls, you cut nominal rates to maintain the same level of restrictive
policy. But the market is reacting in many different ways to that. There have been periods
of time leading up to the banking crisis in which cuts for 2024 went to hikes in the balance of 2023
and then no cuts in 2024. And to a point today when, well, not today, but soon after the Fed
meeting in which 165 basis points of cuts were priced into 2024, which is significantly more
cuts than the Fed, who's basically kept it fairly within 25 basis points of where they are right
this minute for the whole year for 2024. And the market has said that the Fed is behind the curve,
ahead of the curve, behind the curve. And so markets have fluctuated on that news
while the macro economy has just been doing basically the same thing.
Growth, jobs, all the real sort of hard data things related to the growth have been pretty good.
And inflation has come down rapidly, driven, I think, mostly by supply side, but potentially
also the short term interest rate hikes have caused some demand side contraction.
Okay, so going forward policy wise, I'm interpreting this, so correct me in any way,
but it sort of sounds like you're taking the Fed more or less at their word. You don't think that
they're being terribly contradictory from the script that they've laid out kind of from the
start of this thing. How about the fiscal side? Yeah, the fiscal side's in gridlock.
So the fiscal side, most of the traditional
fiscal impulses have to have that can cause some sort of market and economic reaction
has to occur when you have a unified house, senate, and presidency, and we just don't have that.
So no surprise, this gridlock has resulted in fiscal being fairly neutral
in terms of, and unlikely to be able to be used as a lever by the administration to have an effect
on the economy. They have two other tools, and one of the tools is something I've been spending
a lot of time explaining to people over the last couple of years, but recently for high effect is
what their choice is, how they spend the checking account that they have, which is called the TGA,
and how they issue the debt they need to pay back the Fed and finance the economy,
and those things actually have some sort of lever to the real economy and to financial assets,
and so I think that's where you've seen most of the moves that have come in markets in 2023
were associated with that lever being pulled, and essentially because the Fed has said that
quantitative tightening is just going to occur by allowing their balance sheet to run off to mature
in the background, essentially that lever, the effectiveness of quantitative tightening,
has been entirely handed to the fiscal side, to the treasury, and they've used it for a variety
of good and I'm a believer probably less cynical than most. I think they've basically done what
they should have done, but it's had meaningful impact on markets. Okay, and that's because it's
basically provided incremental liquidity that has found its way into markets and propped up the
markets more strongly than most expected heading into 2023? So the treasury general account
spending, which happened from the beginning of the end of 2022 to the middle of the summer
before it was rebuilt, was due to the debt ceiling, and what it did is it allowed people
to... It gave the spending that had already been legislated to the real economy, which they could
have used to buy financial assets, and they would have had to buy some financial assets, but for the
debt ceiling, the government didn't issue any. So because they were not sopping up some of that
liquidity with issuance of bills, notes, and bonds, that left the spending to be stimulative to both
the economy and financial assets, and I think you saw that in both of those things in the first
half of the year leading into a pretty robust GDP print in Q3. And then starting in July, they said,
"We're going to issue a ton of bonds and stocks and bonds and bills and notes for the balance of
the year to rebuild our checking account," and so that resulted in not only did they have to issue
to rebuild their checking account, but they also had to issue to pay back the Fed and they had to
issue to fund the deficit. And that put a significant pressure on assets in late July through
Halloween. And at that point, the market had been pushed down quite a bit, and the treasury decided
to delay in increasing coupon bond issuance on Halloween, and that was the bottom. The market's
been up ever since. Okay, so we've been pulling these levers on the fiscal side that seemed to
have been driving the action more of late versus the monetary ones. There are a couple of other
programs out there that are also affecting liquidity. I know you've written about them
in your most recent report, and I've had people on this channel sort of talk about them, and I'm
hoping maybe you can just sort of help demystify a little bit about this for people. So there's
the reverse repo program that has been getting drained, and as it is drained, that is seen as
an easing or a stimulative factor, but that thing runs out at some point in time. There's also
the bank rescue program that was put into place almost a year ago, the BFTP, and that is coming up
for technically, I guess, expiration, although it's debatable what's going to happen.
Will the Fed continue to extend it? Who knows? I'd love to get your thoughts on that.
I've had some people in this program that say, "Hey, those two things are kind of timed around
the same time," basically. If your finger to the wind looking at how the reverse repo program is
decreasing, and some have said that's kind of been masking the impact of QT, and that once those
things stop, are amended, diminished, whatever, then we're going to really feel the bite of QT
much more than we felt so far today. I don't know if you agree with all those assessments,
but I wonder if you can just sort of demystify the soup of all these other levers that are being
pulled that are driving the action too. Sure, I'll try. My most recent damp spring
report was entitled The Evolution of the Fed Balance Sheet, and that's really, we're talking
about three, really four, and possibly five items on the Fed Balance Sheet that are moving around
quite a bit and need to be understood. To do that, you also have to understand
two other important, three really, other important entities that exist. One is banks who take bank
deposits from people who can spend that money on financial assets or consumption, who also can
create money out of thin air by lending it to people for those things. Money market mutual funds
who have taken on a significant amount of cash in the last, because of the sizable government
spending, who need to invest in something that pays cash-like returns. And then investors
themselves, investors who are interested in owning risky assets, either long-term treasury bonds or
corporate bonds or equities, and their willingness and ability to lever up their investments or
de-lever their investments. Those are the players in this game, and every one of them has an impact.
Let's just start with what's actually happening to the RRP. The RRP is a program that the Fed has on
its balance sheet that allows money market mutual funds to... Banks are allowed to, but they don't
use it for a reason that's not worth going into. Money market mutual funds are the lion's share of
the money that's invested in the RRP. And that money provides overnight interest to the money
market mutual fund, which is very attractive to them. It's not a T-bill that matures in seven days
or 364 days or somewhere in between. It's ready money in case somebody wants to make a withdrawal.
So they've placed some money with the Fed and they get the SOFR interest rate for that.
And so why does the Fed have that program? Well, the reason why they have that program is
the money market mutual funds have all this cash. And if they didn't have this program
to give the money to the Fed, they would chase other short-term interest bearing investments
like T-bills and private sector repo and drive interest rates lower because they would have this
demand, which would result in interest rates, market interest rates being below the Fed's target.
So the RRP program allows the Fed to keep interest rates in their target range.
And so that's why the program exists. Because there was this excess money and the Fed wanted
to manage monetary policy, it had to offer this program. Now we're going to step into the shoes
of the money market mutual fund investor who has three principal investments. They have cash from
their investor. They can go to the RRP, which we just talked about. They can provide private
sector repo, which allows investors to lever up, or they can buy T-bills. But T-bills have a longer
maturity. And so they have to consider, are T-bills a good deal today or not a good deal
today? And that's a complicated question. If you look at where interest rates are,
there's 160, 150 basis points of cuts priced into 2024. That would, to me, say is a T-bill a good
deal? Well, I don't know. It's yielding based on that 150 basis points of cuts in one year.
So they're constantly comparing the overnight rates they get in repo, both RRP and private
sector, and bills. But we do know that for the last six months, the Fed, the Treasury has been
issuing $1.9 trillion of bills, and that's cheapened bills up enough so that money market
mutual funds say, "Yeah, I'll take my bills." And so they do. And you can see that by the extending
of duration of their average maturity of investments. And you can see that by the decline
in the RRP, because what the money market mutual fund is doing is saying, "I'll take my
money back from this program and invest in bills." So sorry, the decrease then in the RRP is really a
market-driven event versus a Fed intention-driven event, where it's just the money market fund
saying, "I think I got a better use for that money than Park can get in the RRP." Right.
Most of it... So there's two things that are happening at the same time. One is that the
government had been trying to rebuild the Treasury general account from 40 billion where,
well, it was very close to zero during the debt ceiling, to what is now in the 700s. And so that
created a drain on the private sector. So there's a drain on the private sector from that.
And there's a drain because $60 billion of Fed runoff happens every month. So
that combination of things of 60 billion times, call it five months, and 750 billion of TGA,
created a drain on the private sector of about $1.3 trillion, $1.4 trillion.
And so that's what's happened. So now the question is, who does it come from? Why did
it come from the RRP instead of from what are the only other alternative for that
drain? Bank reserves. Bank reserves have been stable. And that's where the market forces comes
in. The RRP investor only has three choices, bills, private sector repo, and the RRP.
Depositors who have bank reserves offsetting them, banks themselves who could buy assets,
could buy any asset at all. They could buy stocks, they could buy loans, they can buy mortgages,
they can buy long-term treasuries, they can buy anything they want. And so they haven't really
changed their portfolio allocation meaningfully. What has happened is we had to drain the system
of $1.3 trillion, and it came out of the RRP. And so that's all that's happened. Now, does that mean
that there's been a liquidity injection or contraction? The money in the money market
mutual fund, those investors, they don't know the difference. They don't know. They have their money
in the money market mutual fund. They're just getting their money market return every year.
They don't care where it's invested, so they're not changing. And so the question is,
so bank reserves haven't really changed very much. Does that mean that, and the depositors,
they're just depositors, bank balance sheets haven't grown at all. So it doesn't seem like
there's been a contraction or expansion of risk-taking that's associated with this whole
year's worth of action. So to me, that net liquidity argument that many, I'm sure, on your
program have described depends entirely on ultimately what bank reserves do. They've been
relatively stable and certainly wouldn't account for any change in markets. But more importantly,
bank reserves do not provide banks with any additional ability to lever up,
to print money, to create money, or cause them to contract because we no longer live in a world in
which bank reserves are required. Fractional banking was ended, fractional reserve banking
was ended around COVID. So I think that whole idea of liquidity like that is less important nowadays.
Let me just clarify two things. One, so it sounds like you're saying the draining of the RRP,
it's not really a net contributor to liquidity, it's almost more just sort of like an asset swap.
Cash is going from this bucket at the RRP over to this bucket over here in T-bills.
Just to clarify for the audience, when you say that fractional reserve requirements for banks
were ended in COVID, they were ended meaning banks didn't need to hold any reserves at all,
their requirements were completely removed. Is that correct?
Yeah, zero. There is no reserve requirement in the US banking system. What is required
is that the only way you can... Adam, if you send a check from Wells Fargo to me and you have an
account at Wells Fargo and I deposit it at Chase, my deposit grows, your deposit shrinks, and bank
reserves are transferred between Wells Fargo and Chase. So bank reserves are needed, they literally
provide the way that banks settle the checks that their account holders write.
So don't get me wrong, bank reserves are needed, but they aren't part of the thing that determines
whether a bank can offer a new loan or be forced to redeem an old loan.
Got it. Got it. Okay.
The question is, and this is the big thing that I wrote this about, this evolving Fed balance sheet,
which is I said that part of the drain on both... So RRP plus bank reserves is being drained by
TGA plus QT. TGA is now full, so there's no need for that drain. So now the only thing that drains
RRP and bank reserves is QT. And whether RRP gets drained or bank reserves get drained is subject to
bills market forces. So that's the picture that I'm trying to paint for you. Because the TGA is
no longer being drawn, RRP isn't going to fall as rapidly. And so extrapolating to say three months
from now is just not doing the hard work one needs to do. And that the drain is not occurring
that rapidly anymore because the TGA has been built. But the market forces of T-bill issuance
and the value of a T-bill relative to the RRP rate could result in shifts as they both fall,
because of QT, shifts from one to the other. And that'll depend on market forces. And so
that's the picture. And over the weekend, well, firstly with the Fed minutes on last Wednesday,
and then over the weekend with Lori Logan's speech, the idea of slowing QT
was surfaced. And markets took off on Monday on that news.
>> So the trial balloon has been floated. >> Right. And I saw one of the houses,
I think it was Bank of America, say that we read this thing as a signal that QT will be over by
June. And so July, there'll be no more QT at all. And I think that's the most extreme view that I've
read, that they really want to end QT, take the balance sheet down, what's that, four more months,
five more months, and reduce the pace starting early. That's like a $200 billion decline in,
further decline in their balance sheet. That's the most aggressive interpretation of this thing.
And I've laid out in my work a number of alternative interpretations.
But I think the most important thing that was described in Lori Logan's
conversation speech is, number one, she is concerned that the fall in long-term interest
rates from 5% to 4% is a significant easing of monetary policy and is taking away some of the
monetary tightness that she thinks the markets, the economy needs for inflation to be brought
down. She said that in one part. And then she described concern about the RRP reaching zero
as a, what I read it as, as a financial stability concern that somehow when the RRP reaches zero,
and we'll get to the BTFP in a moment too, because that's as you said on the calendar, that there'll
be some sort of frictions that could cause central bankers to decide to stop QT. And this is the big
tagline that that speech had in it that I think markets have completely ignored, which is her
desire to slow the pace of QT so that it can achieve its goal. And so her, the tagline is
slower for longer. And so the question that begs is, what is the direct? We're all market
observers. When should the QT end? And the Fed's been pretty clear that they think that when
some combination of RRP plus reserves is around 11% of GDP, they should begin to taper.
And that's the only thing they have in print. Governor Waller said that about a year ago.
And they've reiterated that statement time and time again. And that's a statement that would
say that there's a trillion dollars more of balance sheet reduction to do before they are
complete, as opposed to Bank America's idea of 200 billion. What Lori Logan is saying is to get
to a trillion and not stress the system so that something breaks. Let's just go a little slower.
Let's do it slow. Yeah. And that would get us to what, like 6 trillion on the Fed balance sheet?
In terms of assets, 6, in terms of bank reserves, around 2.8 trillion.
Okay. RRP is at zero by then. Yeah. But it sounds like the goal is not really to get down to
pre-pandemic levels on the balance sheet, that they're kind of saying, "Ah, 50% is good enough.
50% of the increase is good enough." Right. And you can think about the Fed's balance
sheet on that side, but I think you have to think about what it is in terms of bank reserves,
because for them to bring their balance sheet down, they'd have to take bank reserves out of
the system. And so, remember what I said bank reserves are important for, not for banks to
determine how much leverage they have. That's being handled by many other things in stress
tests and in the Basel III framework. But what is important is this grease that flows through the
system all the time. Basic functioning, it sounds like. Basic functioning. And so, you have 6,500
banks in the United States, 30 of them are the big ones, but they need reserves. So, you can't take
the balance sheet down to 3 trillion, because that would literally mean no reserves. Because the only
way to take the balance sheet down is that's an asset, the liability is bank reserves.
Yeah. It's the RRP and bank reserves. Once the RRP is zero, it's all coming out of bank reserves.
Right. Unless the government wants to run a smaller checking account, which they have
statutory reasons why they can't. So, the principal relation, then that's why people
are looking not at the asset side of the balance sheet, but at the reserves, the liability side,
and the bank reserves. And so, they've got a number that's a trillion away. And so,
they want to make sure they get it. And so, I read Lori Logan's thing as
financial stability related. And so, that begs the question, what's going to break?
And maybe this is the transition to the BTFP.
Oh, sure. I think that's-
That was put in place when the system started to break. Yeah.
Right. And so, the BTFP was a program in which, not dissimilar from the discount window, which
has been a century maybe, I don't know, long program for the Fed, in which troubled banks
who need bank reserves can lend physical assets, bonds and stocks and loans to the Fed.
And the Fed will give them bank reserves for it against the collateral they pledge. And
that's all BTFP is too. It just happens to have some...
It credits the collateral in a way that they get more dollars for every piece of collateral,
more reserves for every piece of collateral they offer. That's a small thing. That's a haircut
thing. It's not as important as most think. But what is important is, during the time,
deposit flight was occurring at many of these troubled banks because people wanted their money,
bank runs. And so, $100 billion of deposits went from the troubled banks to the banks that weren't
troubled. And remember that Greece, with it, were the bank reserves. And so, these banks no longer
had bank reserves. And so, they couldn't operate without bank reserves, and this allowed them to
do it. And so, it's going to end. It's scheduled to end on March 11th. And Vice Chair Barr,
who's responsible for this program, said he intends to end it. And Governor Williams yesterday
said, "It looks like it's going to end." And so, we have this March 11th date. And at that point,
all these banks that have $140 billion... By the way, there's been a technical thing,
which is the program was designed poorly, and now banks, with no problems at all,
are using the program because it can be arbitraged. And I won't go into the details
of that. But basically, it just means that some banks that aren't necessarily struggling are
using it to get kind of free money through this arbitrage. Yeah, not only free. Money that pays
50 basis points to them for nothing. They literally pay the Fed and receive from the Fed
doing nothing and make 50 basis points. So, that's a bad thing. So, that's a good reason to end the
program. The bad reason to end the program is these troubled banks that borrowed 100 billion
dollars in the first month of the banking crisis. And so, what do they stand? And I'm sorry. Let me
ask you a question that you can address in your answer, which is, a big reason these banks were
troubled is they were sitting on collateral that they had amassed, basically following the Fed
script, which was that interest rates are going to be low forever. And they were buying what they
thought was safe collateral, these many cases, sovereign bonds, treasuries, and all of a sudden,
the Fed changed the game on them. And that was back in March of last year. And if I'm remembering
correctly, bond yields are higher today than they were back then. So, if they have to start taking
this collateral back from the Fed, it's more impaired than it was when they were in trouble
in the first place. So, tell me, how does ending this program not instantly put these banks back
into critical condition? Yeah. So, firstly, let me address the -- if you were a bank manager back
then and you are blaming the Fed, you should be fired. It's not your job. The Fed doesn't manage
your bank. You manage your bank. Right. And you should have interest rate hedges and all that.
Do whatever you want. You can do whatever you want. If you want to bet that the Fed's going to
keep interest rates low for longer, have added, but don't blame the Fed when they don't. The
consequences are yours, you as the bank manager. That's true. And I don't want to get into a big
debate about this because I'm not a banking system expert. But if you look at the Fed's actions
since GFC, it was always, "We're going to step in and keep things low." So, it's somewhat
understandable that these guys just said, "Look, this is the world the Fed has created for us."
And they're accepting the consequences. But let's get back to them, which is you've got $100 billion
of collateral that's probably -- well, I would say it's probably not changed much in market value,
though interest rates are modestly higher. They were quite a bit higher in October. But
modestly higher. The bonds have gotten one year shorter. And so, some of them are accreting toward
par. And so, what's going to happen? Well, I guess the first thing that I should probably point out
that will probably make any answer completely moot is any time between now and March 10th,
the day before the program ends, anybody who's using the program can extend for a year.
So, there's no crisis coming.
Got it. So, everybody can roll over the insurance for another 365 days.
Yeah, there is no event. So, I think that's an important thing.
Right. At least no event for the next year.
Next year. Right. What I think will happen is they'll end the program because right now,
it's offering an arbitrage and they don't want it to grow anymore. But the troubled banks have
another year. So, there isn't a crisis coming from that. Now, that brings us to QT. And it brings us
to the RRP and how you would project the RRP. And so, as I said, the only draw on reserves and RRP
at this stage, because the TGA is fully built, is QT. So, if you include the mortgages,
which you actually have to do, there's approximately 80 billion of drain per month
on the combined RRP plus bank reserves. So, now the question is, is that going to all come from
the RRP? Is it going to come even 150% of that from the RRP? And that all comes down to market
forces. The market forces that have been driving the preference of RRP investors to fund the
drain has been T-Bill issuance. It is an interesting time. We're going to get a quarterly
refunding announcement that is going to tell us how much the Fed, the Treasury plans on borrowing
in Q2 and what its composition is. And that'll be a very important bit of data. But I would say that,
I'm not going to go into that here. I think it has tremendous alpha and really should be studied by
your viewers, but I just can't, I don't know yet what I'm going to actually say when I think of
that. But what I do think is that one has to look at the seasonal financial needs of the US
government and recognize that the second quarter is when large tax receipts are made and the
government runs its smallest quarterly deficit. So, quarterly deficit will be small. What does
that mean for issuance overall? And what does it mean for bills issuance? Well, if you were to take
last quarter's coupon issuance and assume it's fixed, there'll be no bill issuance,
no new bill issuance whatsoever in all of Q2, zero. There've been times when there's been
negative bill issuance of three, 400 billion. Even if you just assume it's zero, there's not
going to be any supply for the RRP to buy. And so it's unlikely that the RRP falls much at all,
because the market forces pressing bills yields up won't be there. So I think it's very likely that
you won't see the RRP getting to zero until well into the second half of the year. And thus,
if we're still a long way from the RRP reaching zero, we're still a long way from any sort of
taper. And that's what I would say is my overall synthesis, which is Lori Logan thinks financial
conditions are too easy, which would bode for maintaining QT. She's concerned about financial
stability issues in the frictions as we reach zero, which is a reasonable thing to be worried about,
but wants it to go on for its full path of a trillion dollars and is watching.
And I think they'll have another discussion in January and discussions in March,
and ultimately they'll see the RRP's evolution and come to a decision around taper. But if they
do nothing for 15 months, QT's done anyway, because by then you'll have reached the
trillion dollars. So it's not like a super pressing issue.
Okay. All right. Well, that maybe hopefully helps some viewers here breathe a little bit easier,
who've been hearing some of these predictions of Armageddon when some of this stuff happens.
So first off, Andy, thank you for demystifying all that. It's been great. My brain has been
stretched. I've been kind of hanging by my fingernails as part of this discussion,
but I followed everything you said and it was great. So I think our viewers are really going
to appreciate the clarity here. I could talk with you about these issues for much, much longer,
but timewise, I got to start landing the plane here. So I want to get to the so what part of
this. So given that outlet, and if there's anything you want to sort of say about your
general market outlook for the rest of the year, please, please elaborate. But what positioning,
what type of assets seem appropriate for this type of environment? What ones might you think are
ill-suited? How does this sort of translate into a positioning strategy?
Right. So I think right now, asset prices broadly measured by things like bond term premium
are unattractive, relative to cash. It's not like they're awful. They're just unattractive relative
to cash. So they don't have a great risk reward. And so right now I have 50% of my beta portfolio
allocated to cash and the rest allocated to a broad selection of assets. And in my alpha
portfolio, I have short bonds, short stocks, and that's really about it. And I'm using about,
call it 40%, 40 to 50% of my risk budget short assets. So I'm not taking a big bet right now.
I do think that assets are by and large unattractive relative to cash. And
when the Fed meets and the Treasury announced its quarterly refunding announcement,
I'll see what they do. And my trigger will be if the Fed walks back some of the financial conditions
QT related easing that we've seen, QT pausing related easing we've seen, continues to validate
the slow cuts that are in the SEP and data supports them doing that, meaning data doesn't
crater in the near term. And we got a decent inflation number for the first time in about
14 months. That was a little warmer than it had been. If data doesn't crater, I expect them to do
that. And then I'm going to watch the QRA and see how much issuance the Treasury needs to do
and what its composition is. And when I see both of those things, I'll either
flip to flat given assuming asset prices are around here or go a little bit more short.
OK. So basically, we've got a couple of important milestones coming up that are going to help
influence your choices here. But I didn't hear you say, oh, if this happens, I'm going to get
a lot more excited about risk assets and think about long. It still sounds like your choices
right now, you're thinking based upon what you're expecting are either flat or more short.
Yeah, I think so. I mean, I do have lots of things that would make me confident in going long an
asset. Like if I were confident that inflation was going to remain high and growth was going
to remain high, my preferred position would be long stocks and short bonds. If I thought that
inflation was going to undershoot and be low and the economy was going to weaken and real GDP
growth was going to be low, I would be long bonds and short stocks. But right now, I'm not confident
of either. So the question is, should I be long everything or long cash? And where I come out
right now is long cash. And it's a subtle point. All right. Well, look, this has been a
great discussion. Andy, I'll be following your work, but I want to offer that when
you get that information, if it does cause you to take a strongly felt position, please let me know
or please feel free to come back on the program. But I definitely want to get the word out to these
viewers one way or the other about what you decide to do there. All right. I know I'm going to get a
lot of grief for wrapping things up here, but I got to be respectful of your time. Lots of questions
I didn't get to. Hopefully, we can get to them next time. I do want to mention, you said a lot
of what your decision is going to be based upon your assessment of the outlook for
inflation and growth. Just a quick commercial folks just recently recorded an interview with
Lakshman Achuthan and he gave his forecast for both. So that might be a nice video to
piggyback on top of this one once you're done watching this one. As we wrap things up here,
I've got two more questions to ask you. The second one is going to be that what's a non-monetary
investment you'd recommend that folks consider. The first one, very important for folks that have
really enjoyed this discussion, Andy, and maybe this was their first time getting exposed to you
in your work. Where can they go to follow you from here? Yeah, so I'm @dampspring on Twitter
and I'm taking a short sabbatical on that on Twitter till February, mostly because I want
to conserve the alpha that I have in this very interesting period we're faced with.
But you can also join me at dampspring.com, which is my website, and you see the work I've done,
which I have an exhaustive archive of prior work. All right, and actually let me ask you real quick
about another venture that you're involved with. I think it's called Two Gray Beards,
and I'm happy to say that working on my -- Very nice, very nice. Thank you. But in there,
you talk about how -- this really struck me. You said, "Retail investors,"
so average investors, regular people who have amassed some wealth, you said sort of the high
six to high seven figures are "the most underserved category when it comes to working with
financial advisors," that they get the highest relative fees and the worst timely advice. Can
you just take a minute or two to talk about why that's the case, why that's important to you,
because the work you're doing at Two Gray Beards, I think, is to help address that issue. And then
maybe one other question to tack onto that, and I'm sorry to force this all in right at the end
here. I'll be quick. I can go on. Nick Giovanni and I created -- who's an ex-Solomon colleague
of mine created this service called Two Gray Beards in which we provide 20 minutes a week
of videos explaining what we think is important for you to know about financial markets so that
you can have a better conversation with your financial advisor. And we think -- And it goes
back to my father passed recently, and I was working with my mother about how to manage her
finances. And she's paying multiple tens of thousands of dollars to financial advisors,
who, by the way, I think her financial advisor does a pretty darn good job. But in general,
people with a million to $20 million of wealth are paying $10,000 to $200,000 a year in fees.
And what I'm seeing broadly is there's a, let's sell them some of our high margin product,
alternatives, for instance. And otherwise, let's keep them in some form of either 60/40 or
age targeting funds. And that's tired. That's 40 years that that has worked.
It's just unclear to me that that's the way to go forward in the environment that we're now in.
And so I think that for a modest fee for us to produce these videos, and for 20 minutes a week,
you can end up, you do it for three months or a year, you can have a much better
conversation with your financial advisor when you do. Because what it mostly looks like to me is
that you, unless you're extremely active, you are spending time investing in your business,
investing in your life, doing the things you love. And then you're having once a quarter or once
every semi-annual period, or even once a year, conversation with your financial advisor.
Or you're making a hard call when you say, and one in which you've got fear or whatever,
when you have no background having the call, but you're calling to say, why am I losing money?
Right. And none of those are good things. None of those, you're just completely at a
disadvantage. And I don't even think you can necessarily evaluate a financial advisor with
the understanding of markets that you have to know what good is. So what we're trying to do is
help you have better conversations with your financial advisor. So I love this in just full
transparency. So what do we do here at Thoughtful Money is we have a couple of financial advisors
that I think are much more like-minded with you, Andy, in the sense that they look at a lot of
the same factors that you do and take them into account. And so I interview, I have them on this
channel weekly. And the main reason to do that is just to model for people with a good professional
financial advisor who takes this type of material into account, how they think, how they react,
how they interpret. And it's not necessarily to work with these people, although a lot of
people choose to do so, it's to show them what a good advisor looks like and how they think so that
they can use that when searching for one on their own. What I love about what you're doing is you're
even saying, "Look, if you're going to stay with the current advisor you have right now,
this information will be like a catalyst to help you get a lot more out of it than you currently
are." And I just think that's a great service to be providing to people.
Right. That's the mission.
All right. Well, look, in wrapping up here, right before we get to that very last question,
Andy, just a couple of quick housekeeping things, folks. One, if you've enjoyed this conversation
with Andy, we'd like to see him come back on the program again. Please vote your support for that
by hitting the like button, then clicking on the red subscribe button below, as well as that little
bell icon right next to it. And just a reminder that I am publishing my Adam's notes, which are my
quick notes, detailed summaries of the interviews that I do on this channel. Those are offered at my
sub stack, adamtagert.substack.com. All right, Andy, in wrapping up here, last question for
you. We've talked an awful lot about money. What's something that is not money related,
but still a worthwhile investment that you think people should be adopting in their lives?
So I was going to say a general thing, which is the most important thing you can do is optimize
your productivity asset, meaning get good at something and earn on it. But I'm going to make
it even more narrow and it's going to sound like a gray beard. Read more books. All right. That's
great. Well said. And that builds off of some of the things that folks have said earlier, but
read more books, get exposed to additional frameworks. One person who was making a similar
comment, Andy said that when you're reading an article, and most people just skim the headlines,
which is the worst thing to do. But when you're reading an article, you're kind of getting like
somebody's opinion, like something that just motivated them that day. When you're reading a
book, you're reading a framework that somebody had to put together and work for a long period of time
to crystallize for you. So you're getting a way of seeing the world. And that's a lot more valuable
than just what somebody dashes off in a morning in a fit of rage or inspiration. So you're nodding
as I'm saying all this. Yeah. All right. Well, very well said. Andy, this has been wonderful.
Reminder, folks, if you've got some stamina left, check out the interview with Lachman
Chuth and I'll put it up right here. But Andy, I can't thank you enough. Thank you so much for
coming on. Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
