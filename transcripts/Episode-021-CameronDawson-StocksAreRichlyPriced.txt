Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. By many calculations,
the stock market has returned to rich valuations. Following one of the best November's in market
history and now juiced by fresh optimism for rate cuts, now three of them in 2024, how valid are
concerns that stocks are becoming increasingly overpriced and a pullback is warranted? To find
out, we have the good fortune to talk today with Cameron Dawson, chief investment officer at New
Edge Wealth. Cameron, thanks so much for joining us today. Thank you for having me. Well, hey, it's a
pleasure to have you on the channel. This is the first time I've ever interviewed you so I'm so glad
we could make this happen. I'm so glad you could be one of the new faces here, one of the
first faces here on the new Thoughtful Money channel. So thank you for coming on for doing
that, Cameron. A lot of questions here for you and as I sort of referenced in the intro there,
we've had an interesting curveball this week with the surprisingly dovish guidance that the Fed
offered this week and the market's response to that. Before we talk about that specifically,
if I can just start with the more broad question I like to ask at the beginning of these
conversations, what's your current assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
Yeah, I think if we're starting with the economy, it's one of continued resilience.
We go back to the beginning of 2023 and consensus estimates for GDP growth for the US were at just
0.25%. We're now well over 2.5% for consensus estimates are getting even further up. We had
Atlanta Fed GDP now just print today at 2.6%. So that's above trend. That's after an absolutely
gangbusters quarter in the third quarter. And so what we're still seeing is, yes, there's signs of
fraying. There are signs of things around the edges. You could point to different pieces of
data to say there is pockets of weakness, but they're not big enough. They're not sharp enough,
or they're not meaningful enough to derail the continued growth of the US economy. They're not
enough to derail the employment market, which, of course, we know drives consumption. When people
have jobs, they spend money. And so the end result is, is that we're continuing to chug along on
growth. And I think the biggest question that is probably on all investors' minds and maybe
incrementally less on the mind of the Fed, according to this week's Federal Reserve meeting,
is that does that better growth come with the risk of renewed inflation? And we have been in this
period over the last few months where growth has been a lot better, but we haven't had inflation.
Is that because of productivity? Is that because of the adoption of exciting new technologies?
Or are there other drivers and dynamics that maybe we shouldn't extrapolate what's happened over the
last couple of months into the future? I think that will be a really key debate as we go into 2024,
meaning that if you see a re-acceleration in inflation, the pricing of the Fed is going to be
whip-sawed around just as it was in 2023 and 2022 for that matter. And then from the growth
perspective, we continue to see signs that at least through the first half of the year,
we're unlikely to have that recession. And we'll continue to assess the dynamics and see if it
is the second half of 2024 risk, or maybe it's a 2025 risk. Now that's for the US. You asked about
the global economy. And what we do see is more distinct weakness, certainly out of places like
Europe and even in places like Canada as well, where you actually have a far more interest rate
sensitive kind of economy, meaning that you have more floating rate debt, whether you're looking
at mortgages or you're looking at bond markets that tend to be more about bank loans, which are
floating rates. So meaning companies feel the pinch from higher rates in the way in Europe,
a lot more than they do in the US. So there certainly are signs of things like slowdown
in Germany and other pockets within Europe. And that likely means as well is that you have the
potential for an easing cycle within those economies. You kind of have to have this offset.
And I think that the one key thing to observe is that not all easing cycles are created equal.
And there are some using cycles that we've had over the last 40 years that have been
good easing cycles. You're easing because inflation is falling, at least that's what the
Fed is trying to do now, or because there's some fears about growth, but really growth isn't that
much of a concern. You have times like '95, '98, 2019, all times when easing was good. But then,
of course, you have times like 2000 and 2008 and 2020, for that matter, where easing was
bad. So if we get the easing, is it good easing and we hit new all-time highs in markets? Or do
we get the easing and it's the bad easing and the Fed's cutting for kind of an uncomfortable reason?
You know, that's probably a question more for 2025 as we're talking about the recession
dynamics. But I think that, you know, we always have to keep in the back of our mind that be
careful what you wish for kind of scenario. All right. Great, great kickoff to this. So
I've had a couple of interviews since the Fed news came out. And a little bit of,
you know, a little bit of either like, you know, Paul certainly projects a sense of being pleased
with how things have been going. And he's projecting a sense of like, yeah, you know,
it looks like we're winning the war, we're not going to declare victory just yet, but things
are going along the course that we would like. Therefore, you know, we're much more likely to
certainly cut next than hike again. I mean, he didn't say it, obviously, but I think the signal
he was giving was, we're done with rate hikes. And of course, you know, with the Fed dot plot and
their guidance, that it, you know, now the expectation is for three rate cuts in 2024,
when it was only two a month or two ago. So on one hand, they're projecting a sense of confidence.
I have heard sort of the other side of the story, which is like, hey, the economy is actually like
doing okay here. And why are they going to cutting sooner than they've been projecting? In fact,
just like two weeks ago, they were saying they weren't even thinking about talking about rate
cuts. Does the Fed know something that we don't that they're not letting on about? Like, perhaps
are they more worried than they're letting on? I'd love to get kind of your thoughts about that.
But if we can in your answer, how surprised were you by this week? And does it change your outlook
in any meaningful way? Yeah, I was surprised by the degree of dovishness by the Fed. You know,
it's interesting because I had spoken to Neil Dutta, who's the chief economist over at RENMAC
a few days before and then the day after. And I remember he said to me, you know, people shouldn't
be surprised by big pivots by the Fed. They've done this all the time. Powell said he's not going
to go 75 basis points. They're not considering it. And then lo and behold, he goes 75 basis points
two weeks later, you know, back in 2022. So at the end of the day, we probably shouldn't be that
surprised. But to your point, it's interesting. You go back to the December 1st speech he gave
when he said we're not thinking about talking about rate hike or rate cuts. And in that,
he said rates are restrictive and so economic growth is slowing. Now, it's a question of slowing
from what? Yes, slowing from the third quarter where we had this huge well above double the
potential growth rate or kind of the average growth rate kind of quarter. So, yeah,
of course you would slow from that. But, you know, when we look at the data that he had going into
it, you know, the Atlanta Fed GDP now was sitting at below one and a half percent. So maybe he's
saying, yes, here's the evidence. You're slowing down. Well, as we mentioned earlier, that got
revised higher to, you know, two point six percent today on the back of the stronger retail sales
data and other components. So I think it's really hard to make the argument that they're cutting
because they're seeing distinct weakness. The Fed has never been good about looking into the future
and saying, oh, yes, you know, there's going to be this economic weakness that will come. They tend
to take what has recently happened and extrapolate it. Now, of course, they did try to predict the
future with the whole transitory business, which obviously didn't work out. But, you know, you've
had Powell now effectively cast off all of the other assertions he was making back over the last
couple of years. You know, the whole history warns against cutting too soon, evoking the memory of
Arthur Burns from the 70s and stop go policy, saying that we must get rates to a restrictive
policy level and keep them there, end quote, for some time. And that, you know, that you have to
get in and keep rates in the higher for longer camp just threw that all out the window. And so,
you know, obviously the first reaction by a lot of people is to go conspiracy. It's an election year.
They want to they want to support the economy, getting pressure from Biden. Yeah. And that that
could very well be true. I mean, you know, we go back to late 2018 and there was a lot of questions
about, you know, in that December 2018, if if Trump was kind of pressuring Powell to do the
pivot that he did, you after markets melted down on Christmas Eve of 2018. So, you know, I think
that that that is likely a component of not wanting there to be a recession in a in an
election year. And I think the other question would be is that, you know, would we have had
would we have a recession if they didn't cut rates? Is the is the economy about to hit a
refinancing cliff where you have now people actually feeling the pressure from higher rates?
And is there risk that that growth would slow material materially and unemployment would go up
materially if they didn't cut? I don't know if that's the case. You don't have a lot of evidence
for for that kind of relationship yet, but clearly that's on the Fed's mind. So if there's anything,
that's the thing that they know that we don't know is that if they didn't cut, we would have we would
have a recession. And but, you know, at the end of the day, the equity market is kind of telling you
that's not the case. Right. Earnings estimates aren't coming down. Equities are roaring, going
back to very, very extended valuations with this idea that we can have our cake and eat it, too.
We can have liquidity. We can have an easy Fed that helps boost valuations and we can have a
strong economy that keeps earnings resilient. Okay, obviously, that's what the markets are
hoping for. I think a lot of people, and I'll put myself in this camp, are still scratching
their head saying, "What changed since the beginning of December?" From the we're not even
thinking about talking about rate cuts to this guidance here. And one question I want to just
sort of put into that is financial conditions have been easing. So as the Fed has been trying
to kind of tamp down animal spirits, the markets have not been helping him. And so
he's had this market that's been really just ready to discount everything the Fed has
said and take it higher. And the whole year, Powell has said, "Nope, I'm not pivoting. I'm staying higher
for longer." The market has said, "I don't believe you," and every time the markets had to move its
benchmark. But still, it hasn't really mattered. Asset prices has powered higher. Up until
this past week, I thought that that was probably pretty frustrating for Powell.
But to a certain extent in this two-week period, he went from continuing to sort of
tell the markets, "Nope, you're not going to get what you're looking for," to basically kind of saying,
"Yeah, I'm going to give you what you want." And if the markets are doing fine, I mean if the
economy is doing fine, I wonder why he doesn't take the opportunity to be tighter for longer. He's
always said, "Hey, if we're going to err, let's err on the side of tightening too much because we know
how to fix that. We know how to reverse that and do easing and whatnot. It gets harder if
inflation gets away from us." So I'm just curious. Do you have any sense for what might have
changed? So I think let's go back to the beginning of this year, which is there was a really
peculiar interview that Powell did in, I believe it was February or end of January, early February,
and Powell was asked about financial conditions, which had eased really materially coming out of
the October low. Yields had fallen, equity valuations moved up substantially, credit spreads
had narrowed quite a bit, and all in financial conditions were at easy levels that we hadn't
seen since the start of 2022 when they were tightening policy. Actually, financial conditions
were easier at the beginning of this year than they were at the beginning of 2022 when Powell
was saying, "We need to get financial conditions tighter." And he had done all that hiking and
tightening during 2022, but as you said, financial conditions were even easier, right? Yeah, exactly.
And he responded in a peculiar way, which is he said, "Oh, no, financial conditions are much
tighter today than they were back at the beginning of 2022." And everybody kind of looked around and
said, "What are you looking at?" And what he was looking at was an extraordinarily narrow definition
of financial conditions, which is just real interest rates, meaning that the financial
conditions indices that we look at, and we know that the Fed looks at it as well, include equity
valuations, credit spreads, level of interest rates in the short and long term, the dollar,
and some have some other added components to them. And what that captures to your point is that when
you have these broad financial conditions indices, it does capture the wealth effect.
It captures the role that rising asset prices have in consumer spending. And what's funny is that
that actual wealth effect is one of the express purposes of quantitative easing. When they first
initiated QE, you go back to the original justification and assessment. One of the ideas
was that you would push people out the risk curve. You'd get people to start investing again. That
would then allow people to, and you do that by suppressing risk-free interest rates. As you get
people to invest again, that boosts the wealth effect and that boosts consumption. One of the
best analogies as to why QE would boost consumption in this really kind of roundabout
way is from Mark Blythe. And he talks about, he's an economist, and he talks about this idea of that
if you're trying to fill a glass of water, effectively through QE, what the Fed did is that
they put the glass of water in the sink, but then they flooded the house and said, "Oh, hey, look,
the glass of water is full," not mentioning that the rest of the house is flooded.
I think that that narrow definition of financial conditions that Powell adopted being just real
interest rates ignores that whole wealth effect. And we know that that contributed to the inflation
we had in 2020, 2021, and started '22, where the wealth effect was so huge that you were seeing
inflation in things like cars and houses kind of feeding on itself in this speculative and risk on
fervor. I agree with you kind of where I scratch my head and go, what's the purpose and the goal
that you accomplish here? Because we do know the biggest risk in them doing this. I think the most
detrimental downside for them pivoting too soon is one where you have a repeat of Greenspan cutting
in '98 and you have a huge speculative bull market like '99 and into 2000. And yeah, a lot of people
made a lot of money, but also a lot of people lost a lot of money. There were people who were locked
out of investing, got so burned by investing that they stayed out of it for a generation.
Also remember that when you hit that new high in 2000, that ultimate high in 2000,
it took you 13 years to make a new all-time high. So financial bubbles are horribly destabilizing
for long-term returns and long-term investments. And I think if we were to say, what's the biggest
risk that you would have is it's in two stages. You get a bubble because you get this speculative
fervor that comes back. You get a melt up, valuations go to crazy, crazy levels. And then
you get a crash on the other side. What that means is that you kind of have to be impartial
in the beginning. You can't beat them, join them, but just be extraordinarily resilient or resistant
to narratives because there'll be a lot of narratives that say, oh, of course we're going to
trade at X times earnings because we're the best economy in the world and AI. And you'll have every
story to tell you as to why it makes sense. But when you look out on a five-year plus rolling
basis it could be pretty dangerous. That's not our base case, but I think we have to see that
as a higher probability today than it was going into this Fed meeting earlier this week.
Okay. That's really interesting. Okay. You mentioned several things I wanted to talk about,
and you may recall from the intro to this, I talked about how markets had been already
pretty richly valued and then they vaulted higher after the Fed meeting. So when you look at,
you talked about what happened leading up to the 2000 market collapse and similar. In fact,
when we look at the past recessions that folks watching this have lived through,
most of them occurred after a pretty aggressive rate hike campaign by the central banks and then
it plateaued for a bit and then really right just as the rate cuts started was when the economy
started falling into recession and the Fed was cutting down clearly in rescue mode at that point
and the markets in most cases had pretty substantial corrections as well. So from a simplistic
standpoint, you can look at that pattern and say, "Oh my gosh, we seem to be perched right there
on the edge of the cliff at this point and this is right where they start cutting and this is where
everything falls off the cliff again." Who knows if that's going to happen? I don't know. We can
say we're starting from a position where assets are richly valued by most metrics here. And I know
that you have relatively recently talked about assets having moved very far very fast and so I'm
curious to get your thoughts about that. Before we do though, you talked about the wealth effect that
QE is supposed to generate. We have been in a tightening regime over the past year and a half
or so since the beginning of 2022, but when you look at liquidity, when you look at measures of
liquidity, it's been net positive in most cases. It declined through 2022 but sort of bottomed in
October and hey, no big surprises. Liquidity started to recover, the market started to recover.
It has largely been rising this year and so we're in QT but it's really maybe more like stealth
QE and that may explain a lot of the market's activity this year. So you're sort of nodding a
little bit and smiling as I'm saying this. I'd love to get your thoughts on this and does it
almost make the Fed saying, "Yeah, we're probably going back to rate cuts next year sound like we're
going to do QE on QE." I think a lot of people probably don't realize
the liquidity story and have been thinking we're in tightening. Are we really in tightening or like
I said, are we really in an easing regime that's masked as tightening? Liquidity is
in the eye of the beholder. So there's so many different ways to define liquidity but we can do
these broad ones where we look at things like Fed balance sheet, reverse repo reserves at the Fed
and what you can see is that these kind of patchwork measures of liquidity declined
really sharply all through 2022. They rose in '20 and 2021 of course during the Fed super stimulus.
They contracted in 2022 and to the surprise of many including ourselves, they expanded in '23
despite the Fed still doing QT, despite the Fed still raising interest rates. The dynamics around
why that would happen does have some relationship not just to monetary policy but also to fiscal
policy. There are arguments that as the treasury has funded itself with bills so really short-term
debt instruments instead of bonds, coupon bonds on the longer term that this is actually added
to liquidity and made it so that way that's found its way into the market and it's kept
longer term interest rates from going maybe as high as they need to. There will be people who
will argue that the treasury has to go back to more coupon issuance next year that they can't
keep doing this bills business and the end result is that you could actually see liquidity drain
next year and wouldn't that be an interesting paradox where we all thought that 24 would be
the year the Fed's cutting rates. Of course liquidity is going to get better. I think a
wildcard scenario would be one where because of treasury funding we're still running record
peacetime deficits that are not in a recession. Record wartime deficits, you meant, right?
Well, wartime level deficits in peacetime. In peacetime. Yes.
Outside of a recession, we've never seen anything like it and that of course has to be funded. It'll
be slightly less bad next year, but it still is near a record, meaning it's unprecedented
and isn't it interesting that now you have stimulative fiscal policy and stimulative
monetary policy at the same time as that you're still near 50-year lows in unemployment.
That's a lot of stimulus and on a year-over-year basis, the fiscal impulse does slow down versus
23 into 2024, but I think it is an interesting thought experiment and I think that there's
a few people out there on the street who have great perspective on this of what does liquidity
do next year because the thing that we can observe is that valuations are very correlated to liquidity
and valuations mostly for growth stocks are very correlated to liquidity. They're less correlated
to interest rates and that's how we look back. If you had asked me at the beginning of the year,
will growth stocks re-rate by 45% this year while you see real interest rates go up to
well over 2%? I'd say no. There's no way. It doesn't happen. That's not the relationship.
The reality is it's not real interest rates. It's not interest rates. It is liquidity and so having
a view on liquidity probably is the fulcrum to every single call that happens next year.
It's kind of an unsatisfying state to be in that we live and die by this, but I think given the
leverage in the system and it is a liquidity-driven market, I think we have to be very aware of it.
I've only really half joked that I do several of these interviews a week and we talk about
all sorts of different macro and technical indicators and all that stuff and I sometimes
say, "Should we just throw it all away and just watch liquidity? Is that really the only thing
that really matters here?" As you talked about, even if you decide to do that, it's tough because
there's all sorts of different ways that different people measure it, but I'm curious saying that it
should be the fulcrum of an outlook. What is your outlook for liquidity going forward from here?
I think that I don't know. I'll be perfectly honest, I do not know. I don't know if the
Treasury has the wiggle room to continue with the bill's issuance and if that can actually
continue to add to liquidity. I think the Fed will continue to do QT, but that's been completely
offset by reserves in other places. Maybe what we find is that as interest rates fall and people
get reinvested and money comes out of money markets, that could have some dynamics on
liquidity, but it's something that we're still working out a way to predict. It caught a lot of
people flat-footed this year. Look, I think a lot of people will argue that it doesn't matter.
At the end of the day, earnings estimates for gross stocks, mostly the Magnificent Seven,
were up a lot. Gross stocks grew earnings by 160% this year. Liquidity be damned. You still have
great earnings growth, but I think it's something that we can't ignore, mostly when you start the
year at such a high valuation. We're trading at 19.6 times forward earnings. The only time that
we've traded above this level, we briefly touched 20 times in July, but outside of that, the only
times we've traded above that level was in 2020 and 2021 and then back during the tech bubble.
2020 and 2021 were of course liquidity-driven markets. You also had earnings which were
depressed in 2020 and they grew then 50% in '21. You put a big multiple on those earnings,
but real interest rates were negative 1.5%, balance sheet growing $5 trillion,
money supply growing 30%. It's a very different liquidity environment than it was back in those
times. People make two arguments as to why you could get back up to those multiples.
A, paradigm shift in technology and consumption or composition of the index and comparing to
history just doesn't make sense anymore. That one's a little hard. It's a very this time is
different kind of argument. Remember back in 2021, the Schiller PE is published online. You can pull
it up. Robert Schiller puts out a note that says stocks aren't overvalued even though my Schiller
PE is at the highest valuation since the tech bubble. Don't worry, stocks aren't overvalued
in 2021 because interest rates are so low and saying, "Oh, well, it's the earnings yield and
the spread over interest rates so the cyclically adjusted equity risk premium." Of course, that was
incredible top ticking on valuations. They plunged over the course of 2022 as liquidity contracted.
The fact that in order to get to your upside calls, and this could happen if we have that
bubble. If we have that speculative melt-up bubble, you could see valuations completely
disconnect from fundamentals. In that scenario, what you say is if you can't beat it, join it in
the short run but realize that forward returns are going to be really ugly in a forward three to five
year basis simply because valuations will have become so extended. You pull everything forward.
You're just pulling everything forward. Yeah, exactly. I'd love to talk with you in a second
about how you think folks can plan for that should that indeed happen or at least surf it as it's
going on. Real quick, back to liquidity, just your thoughts on two other things. I'm curious if you
think they'll get your sense of how material they may be. One is the reverse repo program
has been contributing to liquidity and it's draining down at a pace where folks say the
current trajectory should basically be exhausted by maybe the end of Q1 next year. So I'm curious
if that program is no longer contributing to the liquidity situation if you think that makes a
difference. The other one is we're coming up on the one year anniversary of the BTFP
and unless Powell decides to change the rules and amend the program, in theory at least,
the banks are going to have to basically repay those loans. Are either one of those two do you
think material for next year? I'm not sure about the first one with reverse repo. I'm not an expert
on it and it's something that I'm doing a lot of work on right now. So let's talk again.
Okay, we'll punt on that one. Yeah, I was listening to Powell's comments yesterday
about that kind of level of reserves and what it means for QT and how much they'll do and kind of
that right level of whatever they're deciding. So I need to do some work on that one but we'll
talk about the BTFP. Great and just so you know at any point in time going forward from here next
year, year after, you've done your research on anything that you think is an important message
to share with the audience. You're welcome back here anytime. Yeah, that stuff's hard though.
So on BTFP, I do think I would put a higher likelihood that they extend it
because what do they gain by letting it expire in March? I don't think that they really gain
anything. They might gain another banking crisis. It's all
going to depend on where the price of those assets is at that time. And they're still going to be
underwater because a lot of these assets were bought in 2020 and 2021 when deposits were surging
and yields on the 10-year were one percent and below. So even if the 10-year comes down,
you're still going to be sitting on some pretty hefty assets or at losses much less than when
the 10-year touched five percent. But I do think that the Fed will extend that. They don't need to
introduce, make the choice to introduce uncertainty for regional banks and so I think that it's one of
those things where it's a crisis policy tool that morphs into a permanent policy tool. Yeah,
like what we've seen so many times. There's a quote, it might have been from Reagan,
but it was something like, "There's nothing more permanent than a temporary government program."
Yeah, and I think that there's some interesting arguments as to why the banks bought so much of
that long-term debt and pressure because of different reserve requirements for the banks
that they were getting pressured into allocating the balance sheet into the debt at the time when
Treasury was issuing so much debt to fund all the COVID spending. And so there's this underground
sort of below the surface idea that they were pushed to put this on their balance sheet.
And so the Fed's not going to force them to kind of eat the spinach of recognizing and
marking to market those bonds. Yeah, and that's a discussion for a different day, but like,
I mean, the pickle or maybe in certain cases, the existential crisis that a lot of these banks found
themselves in then was simply by following the Fed's script. So the Fed was keeping interest
rates low. They had an expectation that would always be the game. They loaded up on, quote,
unquote, safe assets. "Yep, I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing," and then the Fed changed
the game on them. So to your point, it doesn't necessarily want to penalize them for doing what
they thought they should have been doing following the Fed's lead. I mean, that's such a good point
of how many policy pivots where they've gone and done exactly what they said that they weren't
going to do. So when all of us are going, "How could they change in two weeks?" They just always
do. And what that should lead to, though, is that we shouldn't feign surprise if they change again.
And I don't know if they'll change to a more hawkish tone in an election year in 2024,
but you can draw a scenario where you have interest rate cuts in the US that happen to
cause dollar weakness, more pronounced dollar weakness, which then causes you to have commodity
rallies in energy and food commodities. You also have, because you're easing liquidity or kind of
stoking animal spirits, you have continued tightness in the labor force. You have a return
back to the lows in unemployment. You then get renewed wage pressure. And what I'm painting a
picture is a story where in late '25 or '24, I'm sorry, you're talking about inflation not getting
to 2% and getting sticky in that old Arthur Burns stuff. You have a window where inflation is likely
going to continue to moderate in the very near term just because of dynamics, base effects,
and used car prices, and some of the things in housing. But housing is a great example.
Mortgage rates fall, housing inflation comes back, people rush into the housing market again,
and maybe you see prices climb and rents start to reaccelerate. And so you can see how this
becomes a bit of a challenge to claim victory too soon if you assume that you could actually see
this restock inflation, maybe not immediately, but in later '24 into '25. All right. Well, look,
real quick on the Fed, maybe expecting them to be inconsistent really should be our default,
as you're saying. We just had Powell come out on Wednesday and say everything that he said,
and then we just had this morning, we had the New York Fed President John Williams come out and he
said, "We aren't really talking about rate cuts right now." So Powell having said in early December,
we're not even going to think about rate cuts to saying, "Oh, yeah, no, of course,
it's what we're talking about right now," to then have Williams come out 48 hours later and say,
"Oh, we're not really talking about it." So there is a lot of inconsistency here. Maybe
Williams was sent out there to be a bad cop to Powell's good cop and they're just trying to manage
sentiment. I don't know, but it's an inconsistency. I don't know what they gained by that. What do
they gain by having that confusion other than wanting to leave the door open in as many
scenarios as possible? It's like they're Silk Sonic, right? Just leave the door open.
I mean, Greenspan just used to like to confuse everybody so that nobody really had a clue,
right? But they're more sort of contradictory statements. Maybe it's for the same purpose,
but it's much more distracting, I think. I think the market appears to be believing
Powell more than Williams, though. Oh, absolutely.
We saw yields pop higher when Williams was speaking and trying to push back against Powell
and then drifted lower through the rest of the day. So we'll see where they close today being
Friday. We'll see where they close. But as of right now, I think the market puts more weight on
Powell's word as they should because he's chosen. They've been emboldened, too, because like we
talked about earlier, Powell has always said, "I'm going to be higher for longer. The market
has doubted but had to shift. But assets still went up anyways." So the markets are just happy
to believe anything that justifies their sentiment that prices should be higher tomorrow than they
are today. And good to remember that a lot of the hawks are no longer on the board. Either
they left because of the trading stuff or Bullard left to go to academia.
There's a lot more doves today than there was a couple of years ago. And you can see that in
the dot plot. There's still one lone hawk circling up there on the dot plot, that dot that just
hasn't moved lower in projecting and cuts. But like I said, the balance is towards the doves.
The balance is towards the ghouls of the world. Well, and when you look at the Fed's guidance
that's given in the past and predictions it's made about where it expects interest rates to be or
inflation to be, record's pretty terrible. So we shouldn't be putting a ton of weight on that too,
but anyways. And the bond market's record is terrible as well. That is worth making a point
because a lot of people worship at the altar of the all-seeing two-year. And yes, the two-year
yield has sniffed out policy turns. It has been the thing that has driven the Fed, but the two-year
is also wrong a lot. So the two-year, and even we can look at futures pricing at the beginning of
2022, they had rates ending 23, I think around two-ish percent, ending 22 around 1%. Of course,
that's not at all where they ended up and had to be repriced much, much higher. Of course,
that led to some of the weaker markets in 22. But I think it's good to note that the bond market,
just as the Fed is sensitive to incoming data and things change, and when the facts change,
I change. And that's the bond market, that's the Fed and why they do things that are surprising.
Well put. And I think my only last point on this is just sort of markets are going to market until
they're beaten. It's painful enough that they start maybe thinking a little bit more rationally,
but once the animal spirits get going, they just love to run until something more external
tends to start to dampen the party for them. And watch that scenario. That scenario for
equities is really interesting. I was thinking about early 2018 as an example of this when
markets want to market, they run, they have a melt up. If you go back to the first couple months of
2018, markets got really overvalued and they drifted higher and nothing was stopping them to
just keep climbing and climbing. You kept going, you're overbought. What are you doing? You just
kept going and going. And what happened is volatility got more and more and more suppressed.
People shorting vol, it got coiled and coiled and coiled. Then all of a sudden, boom, we had
volmageddon and we had really sharp one week period of weakness in the market that kind of
set off a very weak trading throughout the rest of 2018.
I'm not saying that that's the base case could happen, but I think that investors
should be wary of complacency when it comes to positioning, when it comes to sentiment,
and when it comes to valuations. And so, watch it really closely because it may just be a short
period, but if you start seeing people get overextended, overconfident, it tends to work in
the opposite direction. Opposite direction. I think it's important to note for folks that
may not know this, but volatility has been very compressed of late. It's back to very low levels.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So, history doesn't always repeat the same way, but it oftentimes does
rhyme. So, all right. Well, I want to get to your market outlook and given the sense of current
conditions, because things have moved very far, very fast, as you said, sort of what you're
counseling people who manage money should be thinking of in this environment. Real quickly,
before we do, one big topic, the lag effect, which is something I talk a lot about on this channel.
The market seems to have reached a point of view, I think, where it's just said,
"Look, it hasn't happened yet." And I think the Fed's done a great job of creating this wonderful
soft land, just cotton soft landing that we're going to come down on. I don't think it's going
to matter this time around. There are others who have said, "Are you kidding me? We've had one of
the most aggressive increases in rates that we've ever seen." Those are still propagating through
time for us. We've totally increased the cost of capital in this world. We've got this maturity
wall of all these corporations that are going to rerate. We've got tons of consumers that are
hanging on by their fingernails right now. How relevant an impact do you think the lag effect
is going to have before the story is over? I think that we all are collectively underestimating
the role that the great refinancing wave of 2020 and 2021, plus on the heels of a decade
of quantitative easing of ever suppressing interest rates, how that has dampened and
delayed the economies and financial markets incorporation of higher interest rates this
tightening cycle. If we look at households and businesses, we can see on net that they are
effectively less interest rate sensitive for the largest households and the largest businesses.
The highest income cohorts are the most likely to have a fixed 30-year rate mortgage, but 90%
of mortgages are still fixed rate, and the average effective rate of those mortgages is still below
4%. Yes, if you're going out and getting a new mortgage, it's extremely expensive given mortgage
rates are still above seven. However, the majority of households have not felt the pain from higher
interest rates. You can compare that to prior to the great financial crisis and 35% of mortgages
were floating rate. The Fed raises interest rates and 35% of homes are seeing their mortgage costs
go up, which means that you had people get priced out of their existing homes. And that's why you
had foreclosures. That's why you had for sales. You can tell a very similar story with corporations.
You can look at commercial paper, which is short-term paper as a percentage of overall
balance sheets to kind of just compare like commercial paper balances to the corporate ag,
for example. And what you can see is that prior to the peaks in 2000 and in 2007,
that usage of floating rate debt was extraordinarily high. So as the Fed cut interest
rates or sorry, raised interest rates, people saw their debt servicing costs go up immediately.
Of course, we all know we can look at companies who turned out their debt. A third of the actually
was two thirds of all of the high yield debt that was issued in 2020 and 2021 was for refinancing.
So you had this big, huge refinancing wave when interest rates were so low, which has made
refinancing not happen at all pretty much over the last couple of years. I mean, that's why Morgan,
Stanley and Goldman Sachs are having trouble in their investment banking earnings, right?
People aren't doing debt refinancing in the same way as they would typically do.
So what will happen is when you get into late 24 and really it hits in 2025,
a lot of the debt that was refinanced in 2021 for higher yield borrowers, so lower quality borrowers
does start to mature and you will have to roll it over and you will be rolling it over at higher
interest rates. The question is, are those higher interest rates enough to truly cause
a kind of economic slowdown? It's a good question. I guess we will see, but I would think that that's
why small caps were trading so terribly, right? They're typically high yield borrowers. They do
have more floating rate debt. They have more absolute debt and that's why they're rallying
so much because effectively there's a sigh of relief that, "Hey, maybe higher for longer isn't
happening." So I would say we shouldn't become complacent either on refinancing because if you
look back, this is the one last point on this is that if you go back from the beginning of 1980
at the peak of rates in the 1980s, I think the peak was 1982 or 82.
The probability of you in a seven-year rolling period, and that's the average maturity of
corporate debt is seven years for investment grade debt. The probability that if you issue debt
in year one and then refinance in year seven, 90% of the time from 1982 and through 2023,
90% of the time, you were able to refinance your debt at a lower rate, at the lower 10-year rate.
For the first time, that seven-year rolling period, you're now in a period where rates are higher.
It's Howard Mark C change. What does this mean for financial markets? For what thrived in that
environment of ever falling rates and refinancing at lower and lower rates, does that thrive in an
environment where now you actually refinance at higher rates? I think for the very moment today,
the market, because it's trading so bold up on this idea of the Fed cutting and interest rates
falling is saying, "Oh, it's not a problem now because interest rates are coming back down,"
which makes you think that probably the biggest risk for 2024 is that long interest rates backup.
I think that would catch the market the most by surprise.
JP Morgan publishes their client treasury positioning index, and you can see that they
are the most overweight long bonds that they've been in a very long time. That B of A fund manager
survey has the most overweight to long bonds and the highest reading ever on record of people
expecting lower interest rates, not higher interest rates. It's not saying it could happen,
but it sure is consensus. If 2023 taught us anything, anything that's consensus likely goes
in the other way. Exactly. When everyone's on one side of the boat, generally something else
tends to happen. So in terms of candidates, I know you're not saying this is going to happen
or is even likely to happen, but in terms of candidates that would drive interest rates back up,
is the number one candidate inflation restoking? Yeah. I mean, inflation moving higher would
certainly challenge the levels of where inflation breakevens are right now. They're really highly
correlated to oil prices. You can see breakevens and oil is practically the same chart. So if oil
prices rise, as I mentioned, the dollar falls because the Fed is supposedly cutting and oil
prices rise into 2024. Then you have a scenario where breakevens, which is component of nominal
real interest rates would be biased higher. Then you have treasury refunding, which we'll have to
think about that quarterly refunding announcement. What does that supply demand dynamic mean for
treasuries if they step up coupon issuance? And then growth remaining resilient could argue that
the Fed's long-term neutral rate is in fact not 2%, but something higher. And if that's the case,
then the long end of the yield curve is biased higher as well. So I think that after such
bruising years of bond performance in 22 and 23, people are really eager to say now's the time for
bonds to shine, bonds are back. And I'm not saying that I can tell you a story as to why bonds can be
back, but I think that I can also see the risk that yields rise, bonds have another challenging
year. And we can't be positioned obviously for both outcomes, but I think we have to be very
reactive to the data. Technically the 10-year is still in an uptrend. It's oversold, it broke below
its support of 4%, which was its 200-day moving average. But it could be a false break out. We
don't have enough data to confirm it one way or another. And so we're watching this really closely
because I think that's the wild card for next year compared to where consensus is. Consensus is so
bulled up on bonds. All right. I've had several folks on this program who've been very bullish
on bonds and Dave Rosenberg himself has said the theme for 2024 in his eyes is bonds have more fun.
So definitely an argument to be made, but to your point, it's not a slam dunk. All right. So let's
now get into your current market outlook as things stand today poised to heading into the new year.
And from a positioning standpoint, are there assets that you think are particularly well
suited for the type of road you see ahead? And perhaps are there some assets that you would
really avoid given what you see? Yeah. One of our biggest themes for this year is one of
selectivity. And I know that sounds very generic, but it comes from this notion that we think that
we're still late cycle, which just means that very low unemployment, interest rates relatively high.
Yes, the Fed might be extending the duration of this cycle because of the interest rate cuts.
That's a different debate, but that eventually you'll see a pick up in unemployment. You'll see
in, like I said, still not a call for the first half of 2024, but a late cycle nature to this
economy, which just necessitates selectivity. It necessitates good balance sheets, good return on
invested capital, good free cash flow generation. Right now, we're seeing a lot of junk rally
because of that kind of retirement of the higher for longer risk. But if you see any
doubt creep in whatsoever that the Fed's not going to deliver on the three rate cuts and
bond market has six and a half priced in. So, if that doesn't happen, that's where you could see
a lot of that junk give up a lot of its recent gains. Just like we saw the small cap rallies
this year and speculative growth rallies this year, 45% rallies gave it all back up. And that
really tells you that sort of late cycle nature of things. So, I'm not saying those pockets of
the market can't do well. A lot of them very cheap coiled springs. They can have big runs.
They're beta, like high beta. However, I think that being very disciplined around valuation
and keeping them on a short leash, knowing you're there to effectively rent the position,
not to own the position would probably be a prudent thing to do, which of course comes
with all sorts of tax consequences. So, one of the things that we are doing though is we're
looking, of course, outside of the magnificent seven for opportunities for areas that have been
beaten up that have lower valuations. Selectivity is key because we've been doing this all year
in our equity portfolios, but we're dipping a little bit lower, even lower into valuations
where we bought on a regional bank recently. We had it back about three, four weeks ago
and said, look, it's so bombed out. It has such low expectations. Yield curve is re-steepening for
now and kind of started putting the pieces together. Not too much commercial real estate
exposure and kind of going down the line and saying, yeah, a lot of regional banks don't
want to touch them, but this one we're willing to invest in. And so, I think going through that
process of selectivity is critical for us. We do that across asset classes, fixed income,
for example, within credit markets, your spreads are very, very tight, which just means you're not
being overly compensated for risk at this point, which means that we want exposure to credit.
We do have a lot of exposure to credit, but we want to be very conscientious that if you do see
any deterioration in data, that that credit is likely mispriced. It's not mispriced for the
current rate of data being resilient, but if you do see weakness, that's where you would have a
challenge. And the same within alternatives. When we think about alternatives, a lot of people
saying private equity is completely dead. The average private equity is really challenged.
It thrived in a world where interest rates were low. You could just do financial arbitrage,
financial engineering, and it made a lot of people a lot of money. When we look at the opportunity
today, what we see instead is that there are funds that are fantastic, that have never used a lot of
leverage, are great operators, and are more agnostic to the interest rate environment.
And if you think of all the disruption that could happen over the next two to four years in their
investment period, we think that if you can be highly selective, and it typically for us,
we focus on smaller funds, we don't like the big mega funds that have the law of large numbers,
the opportunity set could actually be interesting. So it's chaos creates opportunity.
And even in areas that we would typically avoid with this backdrop, we're saying where can we,
with a very fine tooth comb, find places where we can invest with confidence that we're investing
alongside some pretty darn good operators. Okay, great. And have some of those interesting
private equity opportunities you're looking at, have they been sort of
harnessed with the rest of the sector? So they're sort of trading at a discount in your eye?
Yeah, I mean, it's all brand new funds. That was the other thing is not wanting to put money to
work at valuations that were set back in 2020 or 2021. And what we're seeing is that some of the
funds are having trouble, not ones that we're investing in, but a lot of in general is that
you see capital raising has slowed quite a bit as people pull back from the space. And I think that
what you're starting to see now is valuations for new deals finally start to make a lot more sense.
There's been a huge spread between the bid and the ask, meaning that sellers want to sell at
valuations that they saw in 2020 and 2021. Buyers want to buy at valuations at today's level and
today's interest rates. And the longer you stay in this environment, the more you're going to start
getting this for sales and you're going to start getting people saying, okay, I have to take action.
And that's where being ready with liquidity to step in these moments can be kind of blank and
you miss them. So it's a lot of valuation discipline. It's a lot of making sure that
leverage is very, very controlled and that the return is not dependent on leverage,
not dependent on what the Fed does. It's actually things that are idiosyncratic and
kind of own your own destiny. All right, great. Last question on this. You mentioned commodities
a couple of times, probably likely to benefit from the expected path of the Fed from here over time.
What's your take on them for next year? Yeah, I think a lot of it depends on the dollar.
The dollar being such an important driver of commodities over longer periods of time,
we see it diverge at different moments, but a much weaker dollar likely does set the stage for
higher oil prices, possibly higher ag prices. You talk about gold a little bit differently,
which we can. The gold story in being a psychological commodity, like some of the crypto
as well, is if you're painting a story where you have a lot of issuance of treasuries, which gets
people concerned about dollar debasement, whether it's true or not, it's the emotion and the fear of
it that can drive the price of psychological commodities. At the same time as you have Fed
cutting interest rates and adding liquidity, where you get real interest rates falling,
which are typically good for gold and other psychological commodities, you can paint a
picture as to how they could do well in that environment of more abundant liquidity,
lower interest rates and a weaker dollar. Of course, a lot of other things are components
and drivers of that, but that's something I think for people to keep in mind. Then on the oil side
of things, you just have people so bombed out in the sector after it being so weak, flows have been
aggressive out of energy sector. A lot of people giving up on the space generalist, giving up on
the space. Seems like a pretty low bar to jump over, but you still have excess supply effectively
in oil. It's a question of could Saudi actually pull a 2014? I remember it was Thanksgiving day
on 2014 and they announced instead of cutting oil production because prices were too low, they
increased production, trying to smoke out the frack drillers. Of course, it didn't work. It
quite gloriously blew up in their face, but don't rule that out as a potential thing that could
drive oil prices much lower before they would continue higher. All right. Thank you so much,
Cameron. There are some big questions that I didn't get to that I would love to ask you the
next time we have you on the program. Housing, big one you touched on a little bit, but I'd love to
get your more detailed thoughts on that and something else just as a little bit of a preview,
but when we talk about the wealth effect, you increase financial assets and then people
who benefit from that want to spend more. We increasingly have this economy where the percentage
of households that own the vast majority of financial assets is an increasingly small percent,
so we sort of have this world, at least from the data I look at, is that kind of the bottom 90%
seems to be getting sort of increasingly squeezed by our current policies here,
whether that's intentional or unintentional. We don't need to get in there right now,
but I would love to at some point in the future get your thoughts about sort of the trajectory
that we are pursuing right now. What are the social implications of that? Maybe it's not as
dire as some are making it out to be, or maybe it is. I don't know, and I'm not asking you to tip
your hat here yet. I just want to let you know I would love to get your thoughts on that in a
future discussion. Two last questions for you here as we wrap up. The first very important one, which
is for people who have really enjoyed this conversation, maybe this is the first time they're
getting to know you. If they'd like to follow you and your work, where should they go? You can find
me on X at Cameron Dawson, and then I'm also on LinkedIn where I share things as well, and that
if you just Google or search Cameron Dawson, you should see me pop right up. Okay, and when I edit
this, Cameron, I will put up the URL to your X handle there and also your name so that people
know exactly what to Google. Folks, I'll put them in the description too so you can have one click
access to that if you want. All right, the next question I'm going to get to in just a second,
but it's going to be what is a non-financial investment that you would encourage folks to
invest in? Real quick before we do that, just a little bit of housekeeping. Folks, if you've
enjoyed having Cameron come on this program, would like to see her come back on in the future,

All right, Cameron, so in wrapping up here, giving you the last word, what's a non-financial
investment that you think would be wise for folks to consider right now? Read more books. I think
that it's very easy to get caught in the day-to-day of reading articles and short form content,
but the ability to read something that didn't take two hours to write, but maybe took two years
to write, and the thought process behind that, the ability to read history so that you have context,
things outside of what you're focusing and looking at on a day-to-day, I think that spending time
reading books is the best thing that you can do for your broader mindset,
your perspective, and I think your career life, joy, happiness, all of the above.
All right, wonderful answer. Totally validating coming from somebody sitting in front of a
bookshelf, so you definitely practice what you're preaching here. Cameron, a similar comment was
raised the other day by Axel Merck, who brought up a really good point, which I think you're making
here, which is to write a book, you have to have a framework. You have to have a way to think about
something, and that's what the book is basically imparting to the reader, and there's a lot of value
in seeing the world through alternative frameworks and determining which ones you think are maybe
closer to reality or not, and oftentimes, when we're just reading an article that took somebody
two hours to write versus two years, or even worse, we're just skimming the headlines or we're
just consuming on the worst of social media, we're not getting that. We're not being exposed
to frameworks, and so the book gives you the opportunity to do that. So anyways, great point.
I really appreciate you sharing that here. I love the answers we're getting to this new question.
Cameron, it has just been an absolute joy. Thank you so much for coming on. Like I said,
doors open to you to come back on anytime in the future, but I hope at some point
in relatively early 2024, we can have you back on and maybe get into some of those other topics I
mentioned, but also just give us an update on where you see things between here and there,
depending upon what's happened. I would be beyond honored. Thank you so much for having me.
Alright, thanks so much. Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
