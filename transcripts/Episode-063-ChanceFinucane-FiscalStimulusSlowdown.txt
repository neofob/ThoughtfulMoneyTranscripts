Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
As the stock market trades at all time highs, is this a great time to continue to ride the
bull rally?
Or has the getting been too good for too long?
Is it now instead a good time to take gains and wait for a correction?
Today we'll hear answers to these questions from Chance Finucane, chief investment officer
at Oxbow Advisors.
Oxbow Advisors is a financial advisory firm founded by Ted Oakley, who appears frequently
on this channel, and it specializes in the needs for high net worth clients.
As Ted's CIO, Chance will share with us what kind of market outlook the firm sees ahead
for the rest of the year, and how it's positioning its clients assets for it.
Chance, thanks so much for joining us today.
Yeah.
Great to speak with you again, Adam.
Hey, it's a real pleasure.
I think this is your first time on the new platform.
So welcome.
Also, congratulations are in order.
Since the last time I talked to you, you became a father for the first time.
So that's the best investment anyone can make.
So congratulations.
Yeah.
No, we're super happy.
Thanks for mentioning it.
All right.
As I said before we turn the camera on, you are way too rested looking to be a new parent.
Your kids could throw something special into his college fund because it looks like he's
letting you sleep a little bit at night.
Yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
All right.
I got a lot of questions here for you, Chance, and a lot of them are based on the recent
outlook that Oxbow published.
So we're going to go through some slides that your firm has prepared.
Real quick though, before we do, let me just ask my kickoff question.
What's your current assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
Sure.
So global economy, it's interesting.
It feels like the United States was the only major economy that dodged being in a recession
so far.
You've got parts of Europe, Japan, China, that have all really been slow in terms of
economic growth.
The U.S., I think because of very high government spending in 2023, as well as the generative
AI craze, was managed to avoid that.
And now at this point, we actually think things are kind of in a weird sort of balanced state
where we've seen a bit of a troughing in interest rates, or if you look at U.S. treasury yields
across the curve, as well as commodity prices.
You're starting to see the oil price trickle higher this year.
Commodity prices in general are starting to go back up over the last month and a half
or so.
So in terms of what that relates to the financial markets, we still have a pretty high baseline
risk-free rate in terms of being able to get a 5% short-term treasury yield.
That's a great starting point for your portfolio.
And at the same time, we've got risk assets in terms of the U.S. stock market trading
at pretty high valuations.
Just looking again today, we're at 20 and a half times forward earnings.
And historically when you get earnings estimates or earnings multiples that high, it's not
a great starting point for great returns in your portfolio going forward if you look out
five or seven years.
So for us, we're looking at this saying we want to try and keep as balanced a portfolio
as possible so that regardless of the direction that interest rates or commodity prices go,
we think we have something that's going to be able to withstand whatever happens and
really is not a time to take a ton of risk considering that very high beginning valuation
in the stock market.
Okay.
All right.
So things are kind of equilibrating, commodities are firming up, risk assets are kind of richly
priced right now.
So the word I heard you use several times, there was sort of balance.
So you're, you know, holding a steady keel and kind of trying to position yourself in
such a way that you can play wherever the action is going to go from here.
Yeah, that's right.
So I think before, if you look back, let's say you start in early 1980s up until 2020,
you had this backdrop of a secular decline in interest rates where it was something you
could use for 30 or 40 years.
And there were a lot of different asset classes or securities that were going to benefit from
interest rates steadily declining.
And then in the 2010s, you had very little volatility.
So it was a great time to be an investor across a lot of different areas.
So far in the 2020s, volatility is a lot higher and it's way more difficult to assess where
interest rates are going in the interim.
I could make a case for the 10 year treasury, you'll go into five or five and a half percent,
or I can make a case for going to 3% depending on what happens in the economy.
So trying to make any significant bets in your portfolio that this is the way it's got
to play out, I think it becomes more difficult.
So from our perspective, we want to try and find undervalued high quality securities that
some might work with higher interest rates and higher inflation.
Some might work with lower interest rates, lower inflation, and we've got something that
we think is going to be able to work through whatever happens the rest of this decade.
And then we'll just turn the dial a little bit as we see more opportunities in specific
sectors and pull back in others, and that'll be the way that we tweak things going forward.
Okay, great.
So let's now just jump into some of the things that you guys are monitoring closely to determine
which assets to actually be in, given where things may go.
I'm going to pull up your slides here, so bear with me just one second here.
This first one that you have here is about rate cuts.
I think you said this earlier that it looks like we're going to get fewer rate cuts that
the market has been expecting up until now.
What do you see as the impact of that?
Because it's so funny, throughout 2023, the market kept playing chicken with the Fed,
kept telling the Fed, "Oh, no, you're going to pivot a lot sooner," and Powell kept having
to come out and say, "No, guys, I'm higher for longer."
Every time the market had to shift its expectations, and yet it didn't matter.
The stocks just kept going higher and higher and higher, and we're still in that trajectory
right now.
Fed delighted the markets in December, saying, "Oh, yeah, we're done hiking.
We're going to cut."
It guided the market to three cuts for a while.
The market said, "Nope, we think you're going to cut seven times."
It's had to walk that back now, but again, it hasn't really mattered stock price-wise.
Is this fact that the market is beginning to wake up, that Powell is going to be fewer
and later, as you say here, or maybe slower and longer, as I like to say it, is there
going to be an impact from that?
And if so, what impact do you think?
We think there could be eventually.
It's interesting to us, too, that there hasn't been a significant shift.
Maybe everyone is still holding out hope that those rate cuts are going to come through,
and everyone's just holding the positions they've had over the last several months since
this rally in risk assets, but when we look at this, if they're only going to cut no more
than a few times this year, and if you actually look, the 12-month Treasury today is yielding
5%, essentially, which would only signal maybe one or two rate cuts, that's a decent place
where you can just say, "If the valuations aren't great, let's just stay in the short-term
Treasury for a while, take our 5% against the 3% inflation rate.
You're generating a little bit of a real return and wait for some better opportunities."
Where we see it in specific sectors is there's been this rally after rates dropped and this
anticipation of rate cuts, whether it was looking at banks or REITs or utilities, there
is this counter trend rally, but now the valuation discounts are not as significant.
If you own some of those areas and maybe benefited in recent months, we would be taking a little
bit of that off the table because now the outlook is a bit more balanced where rates
could move higher or they could move lower, and those sorts of assets really are playing
off of the direction of interest rates.
So unless you think you are really good at predicting which way they're going to go next,
you probably want to have a little bit more balance in the portfolio.
All right.
I don't know anybody who's ... I give a black belt in interest rate predictions too.
So yeah, I think your caution sounds merited.
So you talked here about how the 10-year had been creeping back up above 5% here, but yeah,
I mean, we're seeing Treasury yields rise here.
Is this something that you expect to kind of plateau and find an equilibrium like the
other things that are balancing, or do you think that yields could continue rising higher
from here?
It's hard to say.
I think the way we look at this is we've been using the short-term Treasury anywhere from
three months out to two years as a sort of a ballast point of the portfolio.
If we're not seeing great opportunities and risk assets, this is a good place to have
some part of the portfolio, and we were anticipating there might be a real significant cut in rates
in the near term.
And so what is that going to mean for our portfolio if we go from yielding 5% to yielding
three or four?
Are we going to have to start really looking for other opportunities sooner?
But when we look at where things stand in the economy and the discussion of the Federal
Reserve, we don't think they're in a rush to cut things.
And with the stock market at record highs, nothing seems to be imploding yet in the credit
markets.
They don't have to do anything.
So even though they're not hiking rates anymore, they could just stay at this level for a while,
in which case we can just sit here and continue to participate in the short-term Treasury
market until you start to see things change.
I think on the long-term side, it's also difficult to say so.
It's been a similar rise in the 10-year and the 30-year Treasury, and that's something
that you could see if inflation has really troffed here at around 3% and it starts to
trickle higher.
You could see long-term Treasury yields move higher, and that might have more of an impact
on the valuation of risk assets, similar to what we saw at times in 2022 and 2023.
But as of right now, you haven't seen enough of a rise in the long-term Treasury yield
to have an impact.
All right.
So we've had some proponents on this channel of really going long duration, owning a long
bond.
This has been an argument that's been made for over the past six months or so.
And this was an argument that, look, inflation's really coming under control and inflation's
going to be even lower going forward than it is now, basically betting the Fed is going
to achieve its objectives and maybe some of them even thinking that disinflationary and
deflationary forces are going to really start winning out over inflationary ones.
And so anyways, that strategy has been, hey, go long out in duration, and therefore when
yields come down along with inflation, the bond price is going to surge the highest at
the far end of the duration curve.
I know from previous conversations with you and Ted there at Oxbow that, if I remember
correctly, you've been looking at that as a potential, but the conditions haven't gotten
to the point where you've said, no, this is the time where we move from the short end
of duration curve to the long end.
Is that still the case?
Did I summarize that right?
How are you looking at long duration right now?
Yeah, pretty close.
So we've had some exposure to the long treasury bond, 20 or 30 year treasury bond off and
on for the last couple of years.
And we had a position that was significant enough by our standards that benefited from
that drop in longterm treasury yields over the last several months.
And what we did after it fell to a certain level is we cut that position in half.
And we trimmed a little bit of our sectors in the stock portfolios that benefit from
low interest rates as well, just because we thought that you've already gotten about half
of the move that you would normally expect in a recessionary environment.
If you normally see a 150 or 200 basis point drop in the longterm treasury yield during
a recession, you pretty much got half of that in a short period.
And so not knowing whether it would continue to go, like for instance, the 10 year treasury
yield could go as low as 3% if it played out in a full recession and like it has in the
past.
But we're starting to see some things with the Fed, maybe not cutting interest rates
so soon.
Some of those inflation readings that we're looking at might be bottoming and might be
hanging around 3%.
If that's the case, we've been in an environment where real interest rates have stayed at about
one and a half to 2% above the inflation rate.
So it'd be hard to say that you're going to get a lot more drop in the longterm treasury
yield if you don't think inflation is going to fall.
And maybe just to touch on the inflation point, there was some good work we saw from Hedge
Eye that the base effects, if you look at sort of a two year base effect in the inflation
rate, you're actually going to start to see those base effects ease in a significant way.
And what that means is if you're not comparing against very high inflation from the past
year or two, like you were maybe coming off of 2021, it's going to make it difficult for
the inflation rate to fall significantly more.
And that doesn't mean that the inflation rate has to go back up to 5% or 6%.
It just means it's going to be very difficult to see it get back down to 2% or below like
the Fed would hope.
And if that's the case, it puts the Fed in a tough spot where they may not be able to
cut rates.
And this is sort of an environment that we're going to stay in for several more quarters.
Well, yeah, exactly.
Just two things on that.
One, I last week interviewed one of the co-founders of Truflation, which is a private platform
for measuring inflation in what they claim is a much more realistic fashion than the
BLS.
Truflation uses like over 14 million different data points.
It doesn't have the hedonics and the guesswork that a lot of the BLS calculations do.
And they are saying that they are seeing a pickup of inflation right now in their data.
I also had Lachhman Achuthan from ECRI on the program not that long ago.
And he said that not in the US so much yet, and this was, again, a couple of weeks back,
but elsewhere in the world, they'd already seen inflation tick back up again, too.
And they were expecting the same thing to happen here.
So who knows exactly what's going to happen, but there is definitely some data out there
showing that getting inflation from three something down to two may be much harder sledding
than it was to get it from nine down to three.
Yeah.
And I think from our standpoint, the fact that we might stay at 3% inflation for a while
on its own doesn't have to be a huge negative.
Actually, I remember a report David Rosenberg did with his team that looked at decades of
history in the stock market, and they actually found that the best stock returns for the
index were when inflation was around 3%.
So it doesn't mean that a 3% inflation rate is terrible.
What the problem is is the market is not pricing for that.
It's not pricing for a 5% risk-free rate.
It's going to stay there for a while.
And so when you have over 20 times forward price to earnings ratio, it just sets up for
any sort of negative event to happen in the economy, and you end up taking a significant
loss when you really don't have to play that game right now.
Yeah.
So let me get to my favorite topic then, which is the lag effect, which is the longer that
the cost of capital remains elevated here like this, 5% on the risk-free rate, we have
this corporate maturity wall barreling down on us.
In fact, it's already beginning to hit.
We're going to have close to a trillion in corporate debt rerate this year alone here
in 2024, and then even more than that in 2025.
And companies have been -- they've had the hatches batten down, they've been sitting
on the cheap debt that's currently on their books and hoping that the Fed was going to
ride to their rescue and bring rates down by the time they had to refinance.
Well, the longer it takes the Fed to get to the easing stage, the more and more companies
are going to be hitting that maturity wall here.
So how big of a factor is that in your outlook right now?
It's a factor for sure.
It's something that I think you're seeing both -- we see it more with smaller cap companies
in terms of what's publicly traded.
They're the ones that have more variable rate debt, more debt that's coming due in the next
few years.
The large cap companies, some of them have great balance sheets and the businesses don't
need debt.
Others, they have good corporate finance departments that saw the low rate opportunity over the
last decade and really pushed out their debt maturities further into the decade, further
out in the 2020s.
So we don't think it's as much of an issue there, but for small cap companies, we think
that's a risk trying to invest in small cap businesses.
You better be sure they have great balance sheets, otherwise you risk being hit by that.
And then keeping an eye on that for the consumer because it doesn't hit all at once, but as
more and more people need to buy a new car or buy a new home or they need to finance
more things with credit cards that they're purchasing, all of the rates on those are
going significantly higher, a car loan, whether it's new or used car, it's at eight or eight
and a half percent.
We've got a seven percent mortgage rate, which is a huge increase over most people still
sitting on a three or four percent mortgage rate in their current homes.
And then the credit card rate, if you've got an outstanding balance, has never been higher.
So I think that's going to steadily catch up on people, especially as the excess savings
from the fiscal stimulus that landed in people's bank accounts starts to finally dissipate,
which I think it's taken a long time to play out, but sometime in the next couple of quarters
that will be gone.
All right.
And, you know, we're already beginning to see default rates rise on credit cards and
on auto loans, not so much in mortgages yet, although a little bit, but it's really jumped
notably in credit cards and auto.
So we're already sort of seeing signs of that distress there.
And look, I don't want to be alarmist, but you talked about, you know, you're waving
the caution on small businesses and I would say midsize businesses as well that don't
have those fancy big corporate finance departments that were able to engineer all the low cost
debt securing.
That's where the majority of jobs are in America.
And so if those companies do get hit by the maturity wall and they're forced to do cost
cutting that requires them to lay off workers, then you potentially get that vicious cycle
that leads into a recession where you're crimping consumer spending because people are losing
their jobs or seeing their neighbors lose their jobs.
And so they start spending less, which then brings corporate profits down and then forces
more companies to do layoffs.
So I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is that something that you worry about
the longer that we stay higher for longer here?
Yeah, it is.
I can't remember the exact number, but there is a number of this post that I believe quarterly
that it shows the typical rate for a small business loan.
And I'm always so surprised to see how high it is in the last year or two since these
rate hikes have happened and just the cost of capital has gone up.
And I always think that's got to be difficult for any small businesses that need to take
out a loan like that to keep going.
It's hard to know.
You see some of the challenger job cut data, but just looking at how many companies have
done layoffs in the last year or so, or even in the last six months, it's not huge layoff
numbers.
It's just a few percent of their employee base, but I would imagine over time that starts
to trickle through.
And we've been surprised at the how strong employment has remained on the headline level,
but that's something that's always the last thing to move in terms of the unemployment
rate moving higher.
And once it does, that pretty much locks into the recession has taken hold.
And if you look back at all the recessions of the past 60 years, once the unemployment
rates moving higher by at least half a point, you can't just stop it no matter how accommodative
the federal reserve would try to be at that point.
It always will go up by usually at least one and a half percent or more before you hit
a peak.
So like you said, it's very difficult once that cycle gets moving and it'll be the last
thing that happens, but we still see different data points underneath the headline numbers
that suggest that that sort of outcome is inevitable.
It's just hard to know the exact timing.
Okay.
Yeah.
And I'm kind of jumping the gun here a little bit, but as folks have heard me talk about
on this channel a lot and they've seen the chart, if I can find it, I'll pull it up.
But if you look at the fed funds rate, we have a very consistent history of recessions
being preceded by an aggressive hiking of interest rates.
They then plateau for a while and then all of a sudden we start falling into recession,
in most cases concurrent with a substantial market correction.
And then the fed is just chasing it all the way down, right?
They're cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, but it still takes quarters to a
year or more for the lag effect of their easing to kick in and start to heal the economy.
I guess where I'm going with this is, do you see any argument for why history should not
repeat this time?
Because we've literally just gone through that again.
We've hiked rates more aggressively than ever before.
We plateaued down for a little bit.
Are we going to be able to escape the recession or not?
And of course, everybody right now, the narrative is soft to no landing.
We would say we don't expect them to avoid a recession.
Maybe don't know the exact timing of it.
We thought it might have happened last year and they were able to get through through
a lot of government spending.
We'll see if they're able to avoid it again this year.
But we would consider that outcome inevitable.
And I think to your point, the data points that the Federal Reserve tracks by definition
are lagging indicators.
So if they're waiting for those to move before they decide to pull the trigger and raise
rates or lower rates, they're always going to be behind.
And personally, I think the reason why they've always done that is that it may be difficult
to explain to the average person why they're hiking rates proactively ahead of a potential
increase in inflation or why they're cutting rates proactively before anything turns bad.
So maybe they just need the news to turn bad before they decide to adjust.
They need the air cover.
Yeah, but it just means that they're going to be behind.
In a way, I actually think that makes them predictable that they're going to keep rates
up at this level until something breaks that's significant enough, they have to take action.
And by then, it's not going to change itself in the matter of a month or two.
And we're in a cycle that's going to take some time to play out in the downside.
Okay.
Well, as folks can see, I pulled up the chart here I was talking about and you can see pretty
much before every major recession that we've had here on this data series, which goes back
to 1985, we had this rise in interest rates, a plateau, and then the Fed was just chasing
the graph downwards, cutting, cutting, cutting as we were entering into recession.
Let me ask you this, Chance, and this is pure speculation.
But Powell did surprise everybody back in December, where he had gone from the beginning
of December, we're not even talking about talking about rate cuts yet to, oh, yeah,
we're going to do some rate cuts, probably three.
Do you think that was more for the reasons he was selling the decision of, hey, we think
we're getting pretty close to having our job done and we don't want to wait until inflation
gets down to two to start cutting because then there will be momentum and inflation
will actually get too low, right?
Or is it more, he spooked about something and was trying to get ahead of it, maybe a
rare opportunity where the Fed actually was ahead of the curve, tried to get ahead of
the curve.
Do you have an opinion one way or the other?
I'm not sure.
They have so much data at their fingertips and there are so many people working at the
Federal Reserve across the different offices.
You would think that they would have as good a chance of anyone at seeing when something
terrible might be about to happen in the economy and they could be proactive and try to adjust.
But it's hard to know.
I almost would prefer not to play the conspiracy game because it's hard enough just trying
to manage the money and stay on top of things rather than knowing what they're trying to
do.
I think it surprised me, maybe it's just that they don't do well communicating that they're
going to sit still for a while.
They always have to be either leaning towards tightening or leaning towards cutting.
And so once they knew they were done tightening, they had to start changing the narrative towards,
all right, now we're going to be closer to easing.
And everyone got ahead of themselves thinking it's going to happen any time now.
But we think they're just going to sit here like this for a while because there's really
no need for them to move.
In the long run, they need rates to be lower because the amount of interest expense the
United States government is paying on all this debt is going to become a hindrance on
the overall growth and the deficit they're dealing with.
But as of now, if he wants to keep it at that level, I guess he can because nothing is broken
and if inflation is going to stay at about 3%, he needs to have a little bit more tightness.
If he cuts it now, I think that would just accelerate the inflation rate and commodity
prices go up again, especially given the imbalance between supply and demand in some of these
commodities.
It'll just be a repeat of what people were dealing with in the 70s.
All right.
Well, so, Chance, let me bring this up here because this is a potential additional limiter
of a Fed cut, right?
Which is, you mentioned earlier that commodities were beginning to firm up here.
So we have a little bit of a recovery here in oil prices.
If this were something that were to keep grinding higher from here, that would be a problem
for the Fed, right?
Which is that the inflationary impact of rising commodity and input prices could again make
the Fed have to dial back up its inflation taming efforts as opposed to think about cutting.
Yeah, definitely that would be the case.
And actually our founding partner, Ted Oakley, was looking this up with some other members
of our team.
You can go back to 1970 and every single recession, outside of the COVID recession, which we know
is totally different circumstances, in every single recession, it was preceded by a spike
in oil prices.
So if you look at 1974, '80, '82, '90, 2001, 2008, you saw a significant jump in oil prices
that was part of what would lead the economy into recession.
So you could definitely make the case that we see an oil price increase to a level that
that slows the economy down, that causes a recession, forces the Fed to take action and
cutting rates.
And that could be how this all plays out over the next year or two.
Okay.
And you guys are based there in Texas.
What do your oil contacts tell you about where oil is headed?
It's tough to say.
You could either say that, we'll take a step back and look at it this way, I think structurally
in the long run, there's not enough drilling.
There's still a supply demand imbalance.
And even though plenty of people want to say that the need for oil is going to decline
a significant way in the years or decades to come, I think people forget just how many
markets around the world, emerging markets, need cheaper access to electricity.
And it's not going to come from solar and wind.
They're looking for any way to try and get more electricity going through their countries.
And so there are still more carbon-based forms of power that are going to be needed.
And because of that, I think the demand for oil and gas is going to stay higher than expected.
It doesn't have to grow in a significant way, but just we're not drilling enough to be able
to meet that.
And it doesn't take much of an imbalance for the price of oil or the price of gas to move
up significantly.
So for us, I think that's sort of the backdrop.
And then within that, on more of a near-term basis, we do always want to keep out for,
if there is a recession that pulls down global demand for oil and gas, then you will see
significant drops in the oil price.
And we saw that in 2008 going into 2009.
You went from $147 a barrel at the peak down to about $30 a barrel in '09.
You saw the oil price go negative in 2020.
In a case like today, you could definitely see the oil price fall below $60 a barrel
if you had more of a sustained recession globally.
But because we're not seeing that yet, it tells us that more of the structural imbalance
is what to pay attention to and therefore you could see the oil price drift higher over
the months or quarters to come.
And as a result of that, at the start of this year, we were actually increasing our exposure
to energy both in our high-income strategy and in our client stock portfolios just to
be able to be sure we were participating in that enough because we think that's a distinct
possibility this year.
Okay.
All right.
Well, let's move on here to your commentary around just sort of levels of current market
valuation or one might say overvaluation here.
I think you've got this punchline in these charts somewhere, but I recall you saying
that those who are on sort of team soft landing are basically having to expect, if you're
on the soft landing team, like a five-year bull market ahead of us.
So I guess the question is, do we have the stage set for a five-year bull market or do
we look like we've got the stage set for something else?
Yeah, this chart, and I don't have the bottom lines that signify the years, but on the left
side of the chart in that white section, you'll see sort of a bottom and then there's just
this spike upward and that's 1995 to January 2000.
So for anyone who is using the example of the 1994 soft landing where the Fed raised
rates, avoided a recession, and then it led to this boom in the mid to late 1990s for
risk assets, for anyone who's hoping that could be the case where in the mid 90s it
was the internet, now it's generative AI and we get this soft landing and then everything
takes off, one of the key differences is that the starting valuation in January 1995, we
were trading at about 12 to 13 times earnings in the S&P 500 and most of the huge increase
in the mid to late 1990s in that dot com bubble was from valuation multiples doubling.
You essentially went from 12 or 13 times to about 25 times earnings.
The actual earnings per share of the S&P 500 only grew at an 8% annual rate over those
five years.
Today we're starting at 20.5 times earnings, so even if there's a soft landing and we avoid
a recession here in the next year or two, you're really only expecting to get that whatever
that normal earnings per share growth would be.
Right now I think consensus is expecting 8.5% earnings per share growth for the S&P 500.
In a normal year that's about average, but if you just took five years of 8% earnings
growth and then said that the price earnings multiple of the S&P 500 was going to revert
from 20.5 times today back to the 10 year average of about 17 times, we use 16 but let's
just say it's 17 to increase it, that would only be a 4% annualized return on your stock
portfolio over those five years.
So that's where you compare that and the amount of risk involved over the next handful of
years and this being the starting point to getting that 5% short term treasury rate risk
free, we're okay waiting it out and seeing if something happens in the next year that
gives us some really great opportunities in individual companies we like.
Okay.
Well, one of the things that many people have said has been the key thing that's mattered
really to asset prices and large part to the economy, to economic growth too, has been
net liquidity flows and people measure them differently.
Right before interviewing you here, Chance, I interviewed Michael Howell, who's been on
this program before and that's kind of his main focus is liquidity and folks that interview
is going to be coming out at the end of this week.
It's going to be this Sunday, but net liquidity bottomed at October of 2022, which is kind
of when the stock market bottomed and then we've had just a 45 degree angle up into the
right with the markets.
We have very strong GDP growth for all last year.
It's still pretty robust this year and I've talked a lot in this program about how it's
not just the monetary liquidity that we all got familiar with over the past decade since
the GFC.
It's now heavily supported by liquidity from the fiscal side of things and we are still,
even though we're being told this is a Goldilocks environment and everything's great, we've
got record deficits from an absolute basis, but we also have our close to record deficits
from an absolute basis, but from a percentage of GDP, we're at levels that we have only
been under terms of extreme crisis like major world wars.
So there's been a ton of liquidity going into the system that's kind of been rising all
boats.
Your chart here is saying that that might not be the case for the rest of 2024.
Yeah, I think we don't remember anyone at the start of 2023 suggesting that the amount
of fiscal spending by the US government was going to be what it was and how much that
was a driver of GDP growth last year.
But we are confident in saying that that level is not sustainable.
Like you said, outside of a recession, you usually don't see this amount of this high
of a deficit as we've been experiencing.
So we would not expect them to continue spending at that rate.
And if that's the case, that acts as a negative going into this year compared to the huge
spending of last year.
So the other countries on this chart, those are all the ones that showed very little,
if any, growth last year.
And they're actually the ones, especially in Europe, that maybe they're starting to
come out of a recession later this year.
But the US, they put so much spending into '23 that it's going to be a headwind in '24.
They'll probably keep things a bit slower than people may want.
OK.
And so where are these assumptions coming from?
I see IMF and Rosenberg Research.
So obviously, Dave Rosenberg's team was involved in putting this together.
But what sources are saying that US growth is, or liquidity growth is going to be negative
this year?
And one of the reasons why I ask is, I'm sure many viewers will say, hey, so it's an election
year.
Like, won't they just pull out all the stops to keep things going through November?
Yeah.
I'd imagine it's the IMF, some of their own projections, because sometimes they'll provide
some things, same way that the CBO will provide some projections of how they expect things
to go for the US government for the rest of the decade.
Or Dave's team might have put together some of these as well.
I think for us, we're less focused on the exact numbers or inputs, but just knowing
how cycles work.
If you had this much of an increase in stimulus, it's very difficult to sustain that.
And you're right, given that this is an election year, maybe they do just spend their way straight
through the election, try to keep things strong and get a win in November, that definitely
is a plausible scenario, which would just mean that it sets up for a pretty huge headwind
in 2025.
Right.
And so I would view it as less about the timing as, at some point, they're going to have to
cycle through this.
And so whether they want to cycle through it this year and see if they skate by, or
if it waits till after the election, somewhere in there, it's going to be a headwind that
they can't avoid.
Okay.
And you're making me think of a question I wish I had asked Michael Howell when I was
talking to him earlier, but I'll ask it to you.
When it comes to the impact of stimulus like this, or liquidity like this, is it the absolute
amount of what's being pushed into the system?
Or is it the, at least as it relates to financial assets, is it the amount that's being put
in the system?
Or is it the impulse, the rate of change?
How much more is it today than it was a year ago?
Like if they, give an example, if they put in a ton of stimulus and they keep it going
at the same level, does that keep supporting higher and higher asset prices or does it
only support higher and higher asset prices if they keep adding greater and greater amounts
to it?
I think they'd have to keep growing it over time.
So the absolute level matters when you're going from a very low level or zero to all
of a sudden, 2020 is the best example, that was such an incredible stimulus given out
to try and keep the economy going and turn things around, that it was just staggering
the numbers you were seeing.
But we actually pay a lot of attention to rate of change and it's not just on the economy
level, it's also on the industry or company level.
It's something that, it's very simple, but it's funny how often it can kind of play out
this way.
An example I give that we don't own this stock, we didn't buy it at the time, we think there's
still some trouble in the used car market, but CarMax is a business that is a quality
company.
They had an incredible 2020, 2021, like a lot of the auto dealerships had, but then
they had to cycle through that and you have used car prices falling.
And if you look at a stock chart of them, it basically went from near $150 a share down
towards 50 and it bottomed towards the end of 2022 at the exact time that their numbers,
their quarterly growth numbers, or in this case decline numbers in revenue and earnings
per share, were going to start getting less bad.
And after probably a year or a year and a half of things getting worse and worse, all
it took was things just getting less bad and the stock bottoms and turns and it's appreciated
by about 50% over the year and a half since.
That sort of rate of change is something that we pay a lot of attention to across a lot
of levels within the markets.
Okay, super fascinating.
Okay, but punchline here is that if stimulus plateaus, or God forbid, starts shrinking
in 2024, then that's a game changer likely for asset prices.
Correct?
Absolutely.
Because I think the thing that we were all focused on was how much the monetary headwind
was going to come into play.
If you think about money supply being about as negative as it's been in decades or a century,
and thinking that that was going to really be a big headwind in 2023, and then you have
this fiscal stimulus that was a significant offset, well, you're still not getting any
sort of monetary stimulus yet.
And now if the fiscal stimulus ebbs off, or at least it's not going to increase any further,
then where else is the growth going to come from?
And we think that might be another reason why things slow down here.
Okay.
And we're going to get in a moment, I think just talking about valuation risk that's currently
in the market.
But that's relevant to this slide here, which is Nvidia, as your chart says here, now has
a higher market cap than the entire energy sector.
And I think that that's US energy sector?
Correct.
The US energy sector, this just pulls that XLE, the companies that are in the XLE ETF.
And then the other example, I was going through my notes, Nvidia also has a higher market
cap than the entire Chinese stock market, if you're using the H shares of the Hong Kong
exchange.
So pick your example as to which one shows just how much, how high it's gone at this
point.
Okay, so we don't necessarily need to get into the specifics of Nvidia as a company
itself, although part of that would be instructional, let's do it.
But I guess the question I want to ask you is, are we in an AI driven bubble at this
point?
Are we seeing the exponential trajectories of companies like Nvidia and a bunch of other
companies in the AI space here?
And of course, Nvidia's and some of its brethren in the Magnificent Seven are so big that they
kind of carry the indices along with them.
Yeah, no, I'd agree.
You can look at just semiconductors in general.
It's not just Nvidia, but a lot of the others, semiconductor manufacturers like Applied Materials,
KLA, you could look at Advanced Micro Devices as a competitor of Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor.
A lot of these have appreciated by a significant amount in the last 12 to 18 months.
And it's a bit of an arms race where the customers of these businesses, they know how big of
a trend this could be.
And it's not about efficiency right now.
It's about just trying to secure as much of what you need to run experiments and try and
figure out how to come up with products that would be really useful so that you're not
left behind.
And so that sort of gold rush that these are the sort of, they call it the picks and shovels
of this industry and what's happening.
At some point, we would imagine that their customers start to extract more efficiencies
of what they're using, realize where AI is going to be helpful, where it's not.
Right now, though, it's just all a push.
And because there's a lack of supply available, it's increasing the prices of these chips.
And that's where you get these incredible profit margins that Nvidia is reporting as
the clear leader in the space.
So let me ask you this.
So there's no doubt that Nvidia has been growing its revenues and its profits at mind boggling
rates right now.
And that's the promise of AI, right, and the scramble and kudos to Nvidia for being so
far ahead of a lot of the competition here.
But kind of like we were talking about rate of change, can these record profit margins
sustain and/or grow from here to basically grow their profits into the current market
price?
Or are we more sort of, again, to the question of are we in a bubble?
Is this just more sort of a sentiment mania going on here where we're beginning to price
trees to grow to the moon?
Yeah.
And I know there's a slide from the presentation that I pulled from Charlie Bolello that just
looks at the net profit margin of Nvidia over the years.
And you can see just how wide the cycles are going up and going down.
Semiconductors are a really volatile industry.
And right now, you've just had this incredible boom.
And it could definitely last for several more quarters, even, who knows, a couple of years.
But at some point, there'll be a change in demand, there'll be an increase in competition.
This is just the way the industry works.
So when I was looking at, just out of curiosity, what has typically led these booms in Nvidia
and then when did things turn, the last two times they had a real big acceleration in
the rate of change of revenue growth they were reporting.
When that acceleration stopped, when there was a peak in revenue growth, it happened
once in 2018 and then once in 2021, it was usually about six or seven months later that
the stock price finally peaked.
And then from there, you saw anywhere from a 50 to a 70% decline in the share price as
they went through a down cycle along with the rest of the industry and then things would
pick up again.
So you could look at Nvidia in the very long run and say, this is a great place to be.
They're going to be a huge winner.
But at the same time, you could say, right now, it looks like their revenue growth is
about at the peak of that rate of change and it's about to start decelerating either in
the quarter they just reported or the quarter that we're in now.
And you're going to see a steep deceleration over the rest of the year.
Historically, that would mean that the share price could keep appreciating for another
six months or so.
But then as everyone starts to bake in lower growth, then you could see a really significant
decline in the share price and in the prices of some of the other names in the industry.
And we wouldn't want to be there for that.
We would wait until that all plays out and then see where things stand with A.I. and
all these different sub industries in the space and try and pick out where we want to
really invest for the next run, the next up cycle.
OK, I'm going to ask you in a couple of minutes about Oxbow's allocation, but I'm just curious,
are you very exposed to A.I. right now?
We've got it more on the software side.
So our legacy holdings that we've had for years and years in Microsoft and Alphabet,
we've owned those for a long time.
We also own Adobe, which it's funny if you go back 18 to 24 months, there was this huge
concern about Adobe and increasing competition.
And then now they're viewed as one of the big beneficiaries of A.I. and their share
prices skyrocketed.
So we've owned that for several years.
So we have more exposure to the software side of things.
What's interesting to us is if we look across tech in general, whether it's semiconductors,
software, IT services, we've had a position in Accenture for a long time, which I think
they're expecting to be a big consultant for companies about how to use A.I. to improve
their businesses.
And none of these companies really look all that attractive right now from a valuation
standpoint.
The exuberance around the possibility is probably outrun what the numbers really are going to
be.
And so we really haven't been buying tech positions for new clients that we're managing
stock portfolios for.
We've just been keeping the old positions for clients that have been with us for a long
time.
And at some point there will be a change in expectations.
Those tech share prices are going to fall down by 20 or 30 percent or more.
And that'll be the time that we can start buying more again at the valuations that we
would want.
Great.
OK.
All right.
Here's the chart of the growth cycles that you were talking about.
So unless there's some different reason for history to not repeat here, we shouldn't be
surprised if we see the same thing going forward.
We're getting near the end of your charts here.
But anything you want to say here about how we may soon be seeing the dawn of some love
for commodities and what you kind of call the old economy, which had been so overshadowed
of late by the late being years and years, you know, basically from growth and high tech?
Yeah, this chart is interesting to us because I think it's a reminder of how much the financial
markets and the economy run in cycles.
And some cycles are lasting decades.
Some last 10 or 15 years, like commodity cycles.
And I can remember studying the markets in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
That was a real low point for commodity businesses and sector specialists couldn't even find
anybody to want to hear their work.
And that then set off the 2000s, which was a boom for commodity prices and commodity
businesses.
And in the early 2010s, you still had the oil price over one hundred dollars a barrel.
Everyone was really interested in commodity businesses.
Meanwhile, coming off of the tech bubble, even in 2012, back when Marc Andreessen was
writing the software is going to eat the world or run the world, people still were skittish
about investing in tech businesses, which is hard to believe when you see where we're
at today.
But that was only 10 or 12 years ago that that was the case.
And you could have bought a sleeve of tech businesses a great free cash flow yields.
And now we've had the run we've had for the last 12 years and now it's flipped again to
where tech businesses are pretty highly valued.
They're given a lot of credit for their high free cash flow margins, their good growth
expectations.
And we're not saying that you should sell all of your tech ownership of stocks.
It just means that we're probably shifting to more of a balance where keep an eye out
for some quality businesses that have exposure to commodities, because given the underinvestment
in mining of some of these commodities, that's all it takes to see some pretty significant
profit margins and the right management teams of some of these businesses know how to buy
back stock or find ways to allocate capital well, they can be really lucrative for shareholders.
And so for us, historically in recent years, we haven't been owning a lot in the commodity
business space, but we've been incrementally adding a little bit in our client stock portfolios
over the past year, because we think this is a trend that can continue through the rest
of the decade.
Okay. And when you're adding in your client portfolios, are you adding exposure by investing
in the actual commodities themselves, or are you doing more the producers?
Our focus is more on the actual businesses.
So if it's oil, we're not buying an oil price ETF.
We're trying to find businesses that we think are well run that are undervalued and can
benefit if you see an increase in the oil or gas price, but also could do well, even
if the oil or gas price doesn't go anywhere.
For gold, gold's the only one that we will have an allocation to the actual commodity
in some of our strategies.
But then we also will try and augment that with, there are maybe a handful of miners
and royalty businesses that we think are well run that when they're undervalued, we'll add
those into the portfolio.
But you really have to pay attention because a lot of the miners and businesses in these
different spaces, either they're not very good management teams or they have no sort
of competitive advantage.
They're just kind of playing along with the rest of the market and it's hard to generate
good returns.
So it's probably the sectors more than any others that you have to really have a close
eye on what you're choosing to invest in.
Okay.
And because you mentioned gold, the day we're talking here, gold broken out, it's at a new
all time high.
It's been making a run here of late and I've had a lot of people in this program in the
past who've mentioned gold for one reason or another, but it tends to be an asset that
many have said, "Hey, you should just have some insurance," but increasingly have been
hearing that it looks like it's been basing for a long period of time.
Some of these TA charts for gold, people take back like over 10 years where there's been
this massive decade long cup and handle, and I'm not saying you got to necessarily agree
with that technical pattern, but do you see gold as being at an inflection point here?
It's possible.
I think it's very interesting that normally the gold price does well, at least for an
American investor, when the US dollar is weakening and you see real interest rates move lower.
So maybe inflation stays steady, but interest rates drop, that tends to be a good environment
for gold.
Right now, at least in recent months, it's kind of been the opposite where you've seen
some strengthening in the US dollar and you've seen real interest rates stay higher than
they have over the previous decade where they're maybe about one and a half to 2%, and typically
that wouldn't be a great environment.
And yet to your point, the gold prices stayed pretty steady here and now is above 2100.
So we would view that as a positive, whether that leads to an acceleration and it takes
off from here, that's great for our allocation.
The way we view it for our clients' portfolios for the strategies where we own gold, we want
to have a few percent there and then maybe a little bit to some of those really high
quality miners or royalty businesses that would know how to manage an increase in the
gold price and take advantage of that.
And it's just something that can generate a return over a full economic cycle that's
going to be moving differently than the rest of the portfolio and we like that diversification
benefit.
Okay. All right. I think that might've been it. Oh, no, you've got this last quote here
from Buffett. I'll let you comment on the quote here or maybe I'll read it just for
the folks that are listening on a podcast and aren't seeing the slides here.
Quote from Warren Buffett, "In most years, indeed in most decades, our caution will likely
prove to be unneeded behavior akin to an insurance policy on a fortress-like building thought
to be fireproof, but Berkshire does not want to inflict permanent financial damage. Berkshire
is built to last."
So you're saying this is an important reminder to always keep some liquidity in place. Talk
about why you decided to highlight this given the current market environment, because it
seems to be one that's not many people are worried. It's like the water's great. Everyone's
jumping in the pool.
Yeah, it surprises us that's the case. I think it's just interesting to have that mentality
now. I keep coming back to this 5% short-term treasury yield, but it really is amazing after
going through over a decade of zero rates and you sort of were forced to go further
out in the risk curve to try and generate any sort of yield or return. You don't have
to do that right now. And it's a nice starting point to have that. Buffett's quote, I think
every person, every investor is playing their own game. There's been the shift to passive
investing and it seems like it's become more homogenous or everyone's just doing the same
thing, but everyone has different motives, different personalities when it comes to their
financial assets. And I think that quote really aligned with what we do at Oxbow. We're managing
money for people who've either generated most of the wealth in their lifetimes because they
own their own business and then sold it and now need to have that money last and hopefully
maintain an increase its purchasing power. Or we have clients who are still in their
wealth generating years, but their personality is just such that they don't need to take
a ton of risk in the market and they want to make sure that they mitigate any downside
that could happen while hopefully generating a decent return over time. And so a quote
like that really fits with what we do, which I think is unique where if we're not seeing
great opportunities where we can expect a very good return, we're fine taking that free
5% until we see something that looks significantly better, knowing that we're going to be able
to maintain the purchasing power of our clients. It's going to really protect things if you
did have a significant sell off in the markets and then we'll be ready whenever the time
comes that you get a fat pitch and you're ready to swing at it and try and generate
a great return over the next several years.
Okay, so that's a great segue into the last major question here, the discussion, which
is okay, so given this market environment that we just took a big romp through, how
are you guys currently allocated at Oxbow?
Yeah, so we have three strategies. We've got a conservative income strategy that's just
supposed to be very safe, mostly treasuries, municipal bonds. We've got a high income strategy
that's meant to beat the bond market, generate about a mid single digit yield that people
can live off the dividends. And then we have a long term growth strategy that is our stock
portfolio. So in the conservative income strategy, I'd say most of that's in the short term treasury
just because being able to get that 5% until you start to see a significant change, that's
as good an environment for that strategy as there's been in over a decade. On the high
income side and the long term growth side, about half those portfolios are in the short
term treasury just earning that 5% waiting for a really good opportunity to allocate
in areas that we think you can generate a significant double digit annualized return.
And then for the rest of the portfolios in high income, that portion that's not in the
treasury, it's a bit of a split. Going back to that balance idea, we've got some things
in the portfolio like the sleeve that's in the energy sector that would benefit if interest
rates and inflation increase. And then we have allocation to some asset classes like
preferred stocks and gold and precious metals that would benefit if we see interest rates
decline. So we've picked out areas that we think are advantaged that are undervalued
and we're not wedded to one outcome. And the stock portfolios, I think going into the end
of 2022 and the start of 2023, we had a lot of exposure to tech and more cyclical areas
because things had gotten so depressed after the sell off in 2022. Last year, it was much
more about buying in defensive sectors for us, trying to round out the portfolio. And
then to start this year, we've been trimming a little bit of the defensive positions because
we realized that you actually could see an increase in interest rates and inflation,
which would not be a great environment for utilities, as example. And we've been adding
to energy because we want to be able to benefit and play along if that outcome did play out.
So we're continually looking for opportunities. But it's funny, we try to buy things that
we think the downside really in the stock portfolio, for instance, the downside would
be unlikely to be more than 20 percent off of our original purchase price. And when we
look at how things trade, there's not a lot that looks that depressed on a valuation standpoint
unless there's a really specific issue with either the industry or the company itself
that we would agree it's a big issue and we don't want to own those. So we need to see
more of a sell off at large and then we'll be happy to jump back in in a bigger way.
Okay. Last question, which I always find myself talking about when your partner, Ted Oakley
is on the channel. He looks back at the market decline of 2022, which is painful as it was
for so many people because almost all asset prices were going down. He doesn't feel like
we saw capitulation the way that he normally sees a bear market ending. And so if I'm remembering
correctly my discussions with him, he sort of sees the recovery since then as one he's
skeptical of. And the impression I have is he's still expecting that we're going to get
into some part of the market cycle where things will roll over and they'll be bad enough to
see that capitulation. And by capitulation, he means just sort of like the very end of
washout selling of a lot of financial assets because people have just been so burned. They're
kind of giving up on them. He said most bear markets end with people saying I never want
to touch a stock again kind of deal. Does Oxbow still sort of expect that type of development
here or is it just something we're just going to play the market as it is and if we get
a downturn, we're just going to see how bad it gets?
No, we're definitely still concerned and watchful of that sort of an outcome. And I think it's
more comparing your upside to your downside. That's definitely still a downside scenario
that we're paying attention to because we didn't think 2022 was sort of that capitulatory
sell off just to wash out people who just did not want to own anything anymore like
we saw in the end of the dot com bubble and the end of 2008 and 2009. We really didn't
have that in 2022. And if your upside against that is starting at 20 or 21 times earnings
with 8% earnings growth for the market, that's not really all that appealing if your downside
could be 30 or 50%. And that's not necessarily, it doesn't have to be our base case, but if
that's out there and it's an increased risk versus a normal environment and then your
upside is maybe 5% annual growth in the market over the next five years, we're going to definitely
be biased more towards being defensive and watchful and seeing how this plays out because
you can't predict what the catalyst is going to be. But when things are set up this way,
it definitely leans more towards something surprising to the downside rather than the
upside.
Okay. All right. Well, thanks. All right. Well, look, two last questions for you. The
first one is for folks that have enjoyed this conversation and maybe it's one of the first
times they've seen you give your analysis and they've liked it. Where can they go to
follow you in your work?
Yeah, you can look up Oxbow Advisors on our website, oxbowadvisors.com, or we have a really
great channel on YouTube that our marketing team has put together and owns extremely well,
where Ted does some interviews as well. And anything else that we're participating in,
we'll try to post it up there and give everybody an idea of what we're seeing in the marketplace.
All right. And it is a great channel. I watch your guys' interviews as well. You guys do
a great job. A huge fan of both you and Ted. All right. So when I edit this chance, I'll
put up the links to those resources boldly on the screen so folks know exactly where
to go. Folks will also put links in the description below this video. All right. So I've got one
last question for you, and I'm going to give you about 45 seconds to think about it as
I do a little bit of housekeeping here. But the question is going to be Chance. We've
been talking all about money and finance so far in this conversation. What's one non-money

we're back to you, buddy. What's a non-monetary investment that you think would be worthwhile
for folks to consider adopting?
Relationships. I think it's funny in recent years, there's so much in the self-help section
about taking care of your own self personally, whether that's your physical health, mental,
emotional, spiritual, and that's all fantastic. I know I devote a lot of time personally trying
to stay as centered and happy and balanced as they can be. But it's interesting to see
the data points. I forget, I think it was Harvard that did that study that followed
individuals over the course of their entire lifetime, 80 or so years.
That's the longest running longitudinal study of its kind ever.
Yeah, exactly. That's the one. And the number one thing was relationships, how connected
they were to people around them. And I think of that for myself, it's so easy to be focused
on just what you're trying to work on and whatnot, but not losing sight of whether it's
the people you live in your house with, your significant other, your kids, the rest of
your family, friends, coworkers, your community, just keeping that connection, especially as
you get older is something that's top of mind for me because I think that's the one that
probably gets talked about the least compared to what you see a lot in social media and
yet may be the most important.
So I'm right there with you. And I love the fact that you say it might be the most important.
And you're a gentleman that works with people and their financial wealth. And you're saying,
hey, even despite the importance of money, relationships supersede them. So I talk about
the importance of relationships a lot on this channel, Chance and Full Disclosure. My wife
is a marriage family therapist, so I kind of have to be pro relationships anyways. But
I totally agree. I've talked many times about if you go on YouTube where they interview
people who live to be 100, they ask them what's the most important thing in life. And they
all say pretty much the same three things, but the number one thing they always say is
relationships.
So it's totally validating your point there. And I think for you, you've got a really interesting
point of view because what's so sad sometimes with money is it can be really corrosive to
relationships. And I'm sure as a financial advisor, you've seen families that have gotten
broken up about disagreements about money or fights over money or there's an estate
and all of a sudden everybody's just got the knives out for each other. And so it's really
important to keep in mind what really matters because you certainly don't want to have money
be something that you sacrifice your relationships for when their relationships are actually
more valuable in the long run.
Yeah. I actually just saw this the other day. The guy who wrote the Die with Zero book went
out nobody ever has their net worth written on their tombstone when they die. So it's
do whatever you want with your money. But to have that be driving your emotional decisions
and your connections with others is ultimately not worth it.
All right. Well, very well said, my good friend. All right. Well, look, as we wrap up here,
I just want to remind folks that like the good folks at Oxbow, it's a very challenging
environment for the average person to navigate here. There's a lot of uncertainty as Chance
has really laid out for us here. Chance has given folks a lot of great ideas and directions
and frameworks to use. But I'm just going to repeat my normal mantra here, which is
most regular people, they don't have the time, the bandwidth, the experience, or in many
cases, the desire to be the financial stewards of their own wealth because they're overwhelmed
by the uncertainty that's out there or their lack of experience or just the other demands
of their time or whatever.
So I recommend that most people navigate this environment following the guidance of a good
professional financial advisor and certainly the folks there at Oxbow are excellent at
that. If you've got a good financial advisor who is being a good financial quarterback
for you and guide and creating a portfolio strategy that takes into account everything
that Chance and I talked about here, and then is executing it for you, great, stick with
them. They are very hard to find and very valuable.
If you don't have one or would like to get a second opinion from one that fits that mold,
then consider scheduling a free consultation with one of the financial advisors, the thoughtful
money endorses. These are the guys you see from the firms on this channel. They appear
on this channel with me week after week after week. If you want to have just a free discussion
with them, they'll hear your personal situation and then give you their advice and you can
do whatever you want with that advice.
You can do it on your own, totally DIY. You can bring it to your existing financial advisor
and say, I like this, let's do this, or you can continue talking to those guys. So to
set up one of those free consultations, just go to thoughtfulmoney.com, fill out the short
form there, only takes you a couple of seconds. Again, these are totally free. There's no
commitment to work with these guys. It's just a free public service they offer to help as
many people as possible, positioned as prudently as possible for what may lie ahead so that
we can all focus on our relationships and not worry so much about the money part of
things.
Anyways, Chance, I want to say thanks so much again. It's always a total joy to have you
on this program.
Yeah, thanks again so much for having me on.
Total pleasure. You can come back on anytime. Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
