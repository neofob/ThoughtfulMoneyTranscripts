Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart, welcoming you here at the
end of the week for another weekly market recap, featuring my Dionysian friend, Lance Roberts.
Lance, how you doing, buddy? Dude, you're really reaching out.
We're gonna find out exactly how low this barrel goes.
Yeah, I don't know why you're calling me Denise, but okay.
Dionysian, which for those that aren't familiar with their Greek mythology, which was
the Greek god of basically partying of the wine harvest and other things as well.
But we're here talking on the day after the S&P finally hit 5000. So I know that you guys are
got your S&P 5000 party hats on there at RIA. Yep. I was gonna have one made and I couldn't
get it here in time for the show. I actually wrote about that on Tuesday. This is where the
media gets to pull out the party hats and I was trying to get one done and couldn't get it turned
around fast enough. Well, you know what, if you bring it out next week, we'll still celebrate.
All right. Well, look, I want to talk about what that means. We've mentioned on this program that
markets are obviously driven by psychology a lot of the times and there's this psychic
proclivity or big round numbers. They tend to act like a tractor beam. But once they get hit,
is that a buy the rumor, sell the news type of event or does that give a green light for things
to run up even higher? And we have some people out there really saying, hey, this is just a
milestone on the way to a true full blown market melt up. Very quickly, folks, I just want to note
there have been bad storms in California, as I'm sure most folks are aware of the broadband in my
house here has been affected by it. If this turns out to, my video turns out to be sluggish or fuzzy
or whatnot here, just hang with us. We're going to do the best we can here. But Lance, back to S&P
5000 and I don't know if you want to pull up your regular charts or not, but how notable is this and
what do you think the markets are taking from this? Are they taking a, hey, we reached, we hit
our goal, we're going to take a pause here or is this just feeding the beast and the hunger is
for hire? Well, in the short term markets, often when you hit big round psychological numbers like
1000, 2000, 3000, you tend to get at least a short term push higher over the next six months, you
would expect the markets to be a little bit higher. Now, again, there's all kinds of things that factor
into that, but I wrote an article about this very thing on Tuesday and let me share my screen here
real quick. But we actually put together some charts on this and saying, okay, look, this is
great. We're hitting S&P 5000. We tried this back in early late 2021, early 2022. We got to 4,796.
Everybody was convinced we're going to 5,000. That was of course the peak of the market. And then we
had a two year correction. So I wrote this on Tuesday, so we hadn't quite hit 5,000 at the time,
we've crossed that on Friday. But this is just kind of that thing. But in history and look at
kind of when these milestones are made, it took almost 9,000 days for the S&P to hit
1000 on the index. It took half that amount of time to reach 2000. And we've subsequently
continued to reduce that amount of time between these milestone marks. And the difference is
obviously is that since 2008, the Fed's been hyperactive in the markets versus they weren't
active at all really prior to the bottom of the financial crisis. So what will 43 trillion in
liquidity get you? It gets you a very quick ramp up from 2000 to 5000 on the S&P. So we're making
these milestones much quicker. But what's important to note is that yes, when you hit
these milestones, markets tend to move a little bit higher in the short term. And you'll notice
back in 1995-ish, we did have a decent correction after that. And we had the final melt up into the
2000 dotcom crash. But again, that first milestone of 1000 was also free the peak of the market and
the dotcom crash and then basically 15 years of going nowhere. Once we hit 2000, we then had a
correction, a decent correction in 15 and 16. That was about a 20%, actually two 20% corrections at
that time. When you hit 3000, you had basically another correction and then ultimately wound up
in the 2020 bottom. We went to 4000 and now we're at 5000. And of course, 4000 we hit
just prior to going into the correction over the last couple of years and now we're at 5000. So
the point is that these big psychological numbers, they're fine to obtain. But remember,
it took a lot of buying to get there. So the question now becomes, when do these questions
start to get asked about how much am I paying for a stock? And a lot of this exuberance is built
into the market. Markets will trend to go higher just because of momentum in the short term.
But we should be aware that we're probably set up for a decent five to 10% correction sometime
later this year, I would assume, probably sometime between May and October.
Okay. And we'll have you here on every week. So we'll be looking with an
eagle eye at that when you think you see the early signs of that correction maybe starting.
Can you go back to that chart just for a sec? Yep. And there's some other things that go
along with us. I'll get to in just a second, but go ahead.
Okay. So what we see here is pretty classic for an exponential curve, where it doubles in faster
and faster times. And even though we've now hit 5,000, so it took roughly the same amount of time
to get from 4,000 to 5,000 as it did from 3,000 to 4,000. But it would have hit 5,000 a lot sooner
if it weren't for the pandemic. Correct. We would hit 5,000 in 2022 had it not been for the
Russia Ukraine invasion. So this peak right here, we were almost at 5,000. And then that was where
Russia and Ukraine went to war. And then we started selling off. Oh, sorry. That's 2022.
Okay. Yep. So you're right. It was Russia that knocked that down. My greater question here is,
yes, bears have to be concerned about the violent drawdowns that you get when the market gets
very overextended, when it has a melt up run. But those drawdowns, as we've talked about in
the past, they tend to be very compressed in time on a relative basis. The bull run is an
escalator up, the bear correction is an elevator down. So just looking at this exponential
trajectory here, as you look at the next 10, 20, 30 years, expect this exponential
trend to continue. Yes, it will be punctuated at times by sharp drawdowns. But you expect us to
sort of hit each new thousand milestone faster and faster and faster. No. Well, again, you have
to assume two things for that to be the case is that you're going to continue to do $43 trillion
in a decade in financial intervention. So you're talking about a never ending round of
quantitative easing. Interest rates are at zero forever. Debts and deficits are continuing to
rise sharply. You're just injecting massive liquidity into the market. So the simple answer
is that, no, you can't maintain that. You can't even maintain the pace of that debt issuance
like we've done over the last few years. It's just a function that we can't implement that much
capital that quickly. So either one of two things will happen. Either you're going to wind up
in another secular bear market, which is going to happen. And this is part of the analysis
that we do in this article. Let me skip. I got a couple of important charts on sentiment. But
the problem is that valuations run in secular cycles. So once you have finished this secular
bull market, which will last probably another three to five years, we're likely going to go
into a long period of zero returns where the market's going to reset itself. And so you'll go
through a period like you had in 2000, from 2000 to 2013, 2015, where the market just goes sideways,
or you go from the 1960s to 1980, where markets just go sideways. So when you look at this
on a non-log scale, which is what you're looking at here, it looks like this exponential
growth trend is ramping up. But as we start to move out, that rate of growth will slow
just from the function of there's less liquidity that will come into the market over time.
Okay, and I guess a related question is, if you look at a chart of the US debt, that's
also growing exponentially. So if we start seeing that debt growth starting to slow or
starting to level out, that obviously would be a sign that asset prices are probably
going to follow a similar trajectory. Right, and I found the chart I was looking for.
So if you look back through history, so this goes back to basically the 1900s.
What you'll notice is that 100% of the stock market gains came from just four periods of the market.
So those are secular bull market periods, and we're in one of those secular bull markets
right now that started in 2013. So we're going to go through a period where you have multiple
contraction, and that's where you have basically flats negative rates of return over a period of
time. And again, so that's going to happen. And so yes, the trend of the
market will continue to look like this. It'll be this 45-degree slope that'll be punctuated
by periods where it goes sideways. And then you'll have the next secular bull market, and we'll all
be dead and it won't matter, because that'll be 30 years from now. But when we get there,
we'll reset valuations, we'll download this stuff that needs to be done over time,
but that will take a secular period where you have low rates of economic growth.
All right. Hey, just a question on this too. Sorry, I know you're trying to get some other charts.
But if you go back to that previous chart, there really only has been one secular bear market
since 1980. And so for a lot of people watching, the only bear market that they remember
was happening leading up to the great financial crisis, right?
Yeah, 2000 through 2013-15, yeah.
Yeah. And if you didn't work in tech at the beginning of the millennium,
odds are you probably didn't get walloped that much by the dot-com bust. And we had the housing
bubble kind of raging during that same period. So from a wealth effect standpoint, a lot of people
felt somewhat shielded by that because it was, "Oh, my house is appreciating." But my point is,
for a lot of people, a lot of investors today take away the boomers and half of the Xers,
they really haven't experienced much of a real secular bear market.
And so I guess my question to you is, if we do indeed get another one, like you think we will,
just describe briefly how you think that's going to feel, because these are long periods. I mean,
you look at the previous ones, they were 10 or 20-year periods.
Well, I mean, again, you look at that period that, yeah, it looks condensed, it looks like
it's small relative to the other ones, but that was basically a 17-year period on a nominal basis
and 13 years on an inflation-adjusted basis. So it's a function where the majority of investors,
so here's a good example of this. In 1960s and '70s, you had a secular bear market where
markets had a negative 10% rate of return after inflation. Now, let me flip this chart real quick.
One thing you'll hear people say is like, "Well, stocks have never had a negative return over a
10-year period. They've never been negative over a 20-year period." That's wrong. They actually have
had negative returns over 10 to 20-year periods once you adjust for inflation. So on a nominal
basis, yes, true, but on a real basis, yes, there are periods where you go 10 and 20 years
without positive returns. But more importantly, if you spend 10 or 20 years, even if it's a 1%
rate of return, and there's a couple of periods of that in US history where you go 20 years with
a 1% or 2% rate of return, that's not going to get you to your goal. And people left the market
entirely, and this is an important fact, is that after 1974, people didn't come back to the markets
until the mid '90s. A lot of people that were invested in 1995, the dot-com bust, they didn't
make their first investment until 1990. About 80% of those didn't make their first investment
until 1995. By 2010, most of those people were out of the market. So you go through these periods
where you basically wipe people out of the markets. They leave the market entirely. Advisors quit the
business because they can't make money, and it's just a terrible environment to be in dollar-wise.
And the way you know that's true is that 80% of Americans have absolutely no money in the bank.
They have $500 in savings, and they have little, if any, money actually invested in the financial
market. So we talk about the average 401(k) balances of $40,000, whatever. But that just
goes to show you what happens. When you go through these periods, most of these people online and in
YouTube channels and all this that are out there promoting markets and investing and all this,
they'll be gone. They won't be around anymore. I've seen them come and go. Like I said, I've been
through all of this. I saw in the late '90s, we saw everybody opening up every type of trading
school that you can imagine. By 2003, they were all gone. We'll see all these YouTube channels and
all this that are all finance-related investing. They'll be gone because nobody will want to watch
them. Yeah, and that's kind of where I'm going with this, which is housing. We've mentioned this
in the past. It pretty much increased at the rate of inflation up until the late '90s. And then the
market for mortgage securities got securitized. And then all of a sudden, it became this asset
to get gains off of. And people started buying homes for appreciation as opposed to just for
shelter. And so we now as a society have this mentality that a home is an investment that can
make you hopefully a lot of money in a relatively short period of time. If you buy it at the right
price and sell it a few years later in a hot market. And we can have a long discussion about
whether that's really true. And have we bid home prices up to unsustainable levels right now? And
does there need to be some big clearing event to get prices down to true values? And I'm sort of
trying to make an analogy here with the stock market where there are lots of periods of time
where the stock market doesn't give you YOLO gains. But we've come to expect them because we've
just had so many of them over the past couple of decades, largely because of all the intervention
that you talked about there, Lance. If we enter into a new secular bear market, is that just one
where people aren't glued to their screens wondering what the latest tech stock did this
day? And people aren't expecting that, well, of course, I'm going to get consistent 8%, 9%
or double digit percent returns in my portfolio, which a lot of people have gotten really used to
over the past 20 years. No, not past 20 years, past 10 years. So we've increased, and I've gone
through this with you before, from 2009 to present, we increased the average rate of return in stocks
by 50% over what we saw in the previous 120 years. So that's the problem with all
these financial inventions. And here's a chart of what you were just saying. Prior to 2000,
you had a responsible relationship between the buyer and the lender, and house prices rose
relatively at the rate of both wage growth and inflation. And you see that post 2000,
this big gap that's emerged between what wages will pay for and what's happening with housing
prices. So again, this is all today's article exactly to your point, talking about that the
Democrats are now pushing this whole idea to make housing even more unaffordable. And this was due
to a comment that Elizabeth Warren and three other Democrats made to Jerome Powell saying, "Hey, you
need to cut rates to make housing affordable. It does not make housing affordable, it makes it
unaffordable." And this has been the whole problem that we've been going on because it's all about
supply and demand. We have plenty of supply. There's currently eight months of supply of houses
in the markets right now. Normally, when you have eight months of supply of houses in the markets,
you're normally in a recession. So plenty of supply. The problem is that you've run the prices
up so much and you're failing to allow the process to occur to bring those housing prices back down
with that. Also, of course, the other big problem is that you've got 44% of all home purchases
were done by institutions like BlackRock, Blackstone, and others in 2023 alone. So
almost half of all houses sold last year were bought by institutions to turn into rentals.
So that's why you can't get to a place where housing is affordable. And I go through solutions
in this article about how to make housing affordable. And the problem is that nobody
will ever pass these bills. Or will any person actually want this to happen? But once you put
back on a 20% down payment, no split mortgages, you have to pay PMI mortgage insurance, all of a
sudden houses and prices will come down very quickly. And you have to go through a period
of time where you allow that to occur. But once you get that responsible relationship between
buyer and lender back into place, houses will return back to growth with inflation.
Hey, if you can, especially for those that are listening on a podcast and can't see the video
here, can you just read through your five points there? Because we talk a lot about housing on this
channel. I think both you and I think it's terrible, the levels of unaffordability it's
gotten to and how that's really just taking off a lot of opportunity from the majority of Americans,
but certainly from the younger folks that are trying to form households and whatnot. And I agree
that housing is like many issues that we face now, which is we are far past beyond the point
where we can have a painless solution to get things back in alignment, but we should do it
as quickly as we can because the longer we delay, the more the pain we're going to take in the
future anyways. So I'm a huge fan of just having just adult sized discussions around, okay,
if we really want to reform, if we really want to clean things up, what's it going to take?
So I'd love for folks to hear your ideas. Sure. Yeah. It's called the terrible,
terrible solution because again, there's only one solution to make housing affordable
and it's not by, and yes, you could just massively increase supply. That is certainly an option,
but that doesn't really solve your problem long-term. So to really get it back into place,
you got to restrict corporate institutional interests from buying individual homes.
There's actually a bill that is being floated around Congress. It's not going to go anywhere.
It's dead on arrival, but the thesis was that it would require all institutions to sell 10%
of their holdings over the next 10, every year for the next 10 years. So it'll never go anywhere,
but you have to do that. Sorry to interrupt because I know we're going to get some comments
in the comment section about this where people who are libertarian minded, free market minded
are going to say, "Hey, wait a minute. No, that's not free markets. Why not just let the market
decide who gets to afford what?" There's sort of two things about this. I'll give you my thoughts.
You can chime in. One is that's sort of the role of government is to determine where the lines at
the playing field are. I use the example of like, look, if we didn't have some sort of protective
rules and regulations, we would have parts of the country where we would have deforested every tree
or we'd fish every tuna out of the ocean and that last tuna would command an amazing price,
but then we would have no tuna after that. You have to basically say, look, we have to be a
steward of our resources to a certain extent and homes for people to live in, my opinion,
is one of those things. Secondly, it's not a fair competition when you put the regular home buyer
up against a large corporation that has far deeper pockets, but also can borrow at much cheaper rates
than the average person can. And so it's a total David versus Goliath competition in most cases.
And it's the consumers at a huge disadvantage. And again, they're trying to buy a place to live in
versus a corporation that's just trying to hopefully get a little bit of more incremental
growth for their income statement. Yeah. And I said, this is a terrible, terrible solution.
This is going to step on people's feet. But in order to fix the problem, now once the problem's
fixed, then you can come back and say, OK, now we'll allow institutions back in to buy that.
But I mean, you can put a simple rule in place. You can't buy a house unless you're going to live
in it. But that gets really problematic as well, because there's a lot of individuals that buy
homes, they turn them into rentals. That's how they make their income. And so you're going to
step on somebody's feet somewhere. But the problem is we have 44 percent of all your homes being
bought by corporations that removes them from the ability for people to buy them to live in.
That's the problem. So, you know, and all I'm talking about is individual homes. I know you're
buying individual homes. If they want to go buy multi-families, go. Corporations can buy all the
multi-family apartments they want. I have no problem with that. Right. Because that's a whole
different bailiwick. But we're talking about individual homes for people to live in. It's
reached the point that it has a negative impact to the average American trying to buy homes. Right.
The second thing is increased lending standards to require minimum 15 percent down payment,
good credit score, such as also going to increase the stability of banks against another housing
crisis. So this would just eliminate all potential like subprime mortgages, adjustable rate mortgages,
all that, you know, get all that out of the system, because once you start requiring and look, I said 15
percent, we have to be 20 when I was growing up. But even at 15 percent, homeowners have a much
bigger stake in the game. And if they can afford to say the reason this is the reason this is
important is that if you can have the cash flow at home, you get your budget set up at home where
you can save a 20 percent down payment. That's really a two sided coin. Yes, you've got a good
credit score and you've saved up 20 percent down payment for the home, which that's good for the
banks. But it's also good for you because it tells you that, hey, I've got enough free cash flow that
I can save up this much money, which means I can afford a home because buying a home is not just
the purchase price. It's the HOA taxes. It's the maintenance. It's the dues. It's the property taxes.
It's the school taxes. It's all this other stuff that goes on with homeownership that puts people
in a bad situation. We saw just article after article after statistic after the pandemic,
these young millennials went out and they bought homes with their STEMI checks and said,
well, nobody told me I had to replace the washer and the dryer and nobody told me about property
taxes. All of a sudden the house, they bought these houses and they couldn't afford them because
of all the expenses that go along with it. But if you can save up that 15 or 20 percent, it says,
hey, financially, you're in a good position to be able to own a piece of property. Go for it.
And again, that solves a whole lot of problems on both sides. Increase your debt income ratios
for homebuyers. Again, that resolves all the problems with subprime mortgages, et cetera.
Return the mortgage market back to straight fixed rate mortgages. So again, get rid of these
adjustable fixed rate splits, all this other stuff that leads to. And the reason that you get rid of
those is that allows people to figure out a way to get into a home with much less of a down payment,
trying to work the work, the angles in the markets to get into a house they really can't afford.
Fannie Mae FHA has a three percent down mortgage. Those got to go. It's got to be a 15 percent down
mortgage. Yes, mortgage companies are going to suck. They're going to hate this idea because
they're not going to make nearly as much money. The banks are going to hate this idea because
they're not going to make nearly as much money off of you. They don't mark the market their mortgages
anyway. So once you go upside down in the house, they don't care because it really doesn't affect
them. This solves all that across the board. Again, terrible, terrible solution, but it solves
all the problems. Yeah. And let me just grab part of this rail, which is you're going to have a lot
of people say, well, Lance, you're preventing the lower echelons of society from getting into
becoming homeowners because these are the folks that can't scratch the stuff up.
And I totally get what you're saying where you're saying, yeah, I mean, to a certain extent, yes,
it sucks to be them. But what we're trying to do here is bring the market back into a healthy
balance. And it's allowing people to get into houses who then once they're in the house,
through these extraordinary discounts and measures that once they're in the house,
they can't afford it. Right. Which is exactly what we saw during 2008. All these people got
in on subprime mortgages, blew themselves up because they couldn't afford the house once they
got into it. And the bottom line is, is that homeownership is not for everybody. Homeownership
is not a right. It's a privilege. And it means that you've done the work to get to the position
to be able to afford a home. And, you know, if you want to aspire to own a home,
fix the other things in your life to allow you to get to that point. Right. If you have to work
multiple jobs, you've got to get better education. Whatever it is, I'm just I'm just saying is that
homeownership is not a right. Every time we want something in this society, it's like, oh, you know,
I want that. Oh, that's a right. I should have that right. No, no. You have basic rights.
Freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom to bear arms, those type of things. Those are
your rights. Those are established in the Constitution. Homeownership, health care,
education. Those aren't rights. Those are privileges. And you earn those by doing the
work necessary to get there. Yeah. And I was going to bring up both those examples. If you
look at education, you look at health care, they're in the exact same state that we are right now in
the housing market, right, where, you know, education now has got up to just ridiculous
nosebleed levels. I think it's the single product that has inflated the most over the past couple of
decades. And through great inflation, you know, we make it easier for people who really aren't doing
learning what we want them to learn to get into college. And then the government is happy to
lend you as much money as you want to go to the college of your choice to get whatever
degree you want. And millions of people who probably would not have been able to get into
college are now going, leaving with a piece of paper and saddled with a lifetime of debt and
saying, what the hell did I just do to myself? Right. I mean, to your point, it's like,
a college isn't for everybody, but also like, it's not serving the long term interests of
these people, right? It exposes to, oh, hey, we're going to put a college degree within your reach.
And what it ends up doing is, in way too many cases, is giving people very little to
know useful education, and making them basically a debt surfer for the rest of their lives.
Yeah. And so the last point is require all banks to extend mortgages to hold 25% of the mortgage
on their books. That also cleans up the banking side. And it just basically means the bank can't
punt the risk off to somebody else. Exactly. And right now, the banks can sell off 100% of the
mortgage to somebody else. And you know, they just maybe hold servicing rights or something. And that
takes all the liability off their books. But let me just read to you this, you know, and look,
you know, like I said, I know you're going to get a lot of pushback from these points. But again,
this is the whole reason it's called a terrible, terrible solution. Let me just read to you this
paragraph. Yes, those are very tough standards to meet and initially would exclude many from
homeownership. But homeownership should be a demanding standard to meet as the cost of
homeownership is high. For the individual, such standards would ensure that homeownership is
feasible, and that such ownership along with the subsequent fees, taxes, maintenance, etc,
costs, etc, would still allow for financial stability. For the lenders, it would reduce
the liability of another financial crisis to almost zero, as the housing market stability
would be inevitable. But most importantly, such strict standards would immediately cause
an evaporation of housing demand. With a complete lack of demand, housing prices would fall and
reverse the vast depreciation caused by a decade of fiscal and monetary largess. Yes, it would be a
very tough market until those excesses reversed, but such as the consequences of allowing banks
and institutions to run amok in the housing market for so long. Now, unfortunately, none of this is
that look, this is just my article, you can hate on me all day long. None of this is ever going to
happen. Let me just invite folks watching that if you don't like the solutions, if you think these
are bad ideas, hey, totally a prerogative. But then propose your own solutions in the comment
section. Don't just hate without providing an alternative here. And let's get that adult size
discussion going. Thanks for going through all that, Lance. I know that there was a tangent we
weren't necessarily expecting to take today. But actually, I think it's a really valuable one. And
I love the fact that you came with specific constructive proposals for reform, because
it's one thing to just sit there and curse the darkness to do the work and actually light a
candle and try to find a better way out. We need a lot more of that. Okay, so back to the S&P for
a second, because I want to make sure we don't miss it. Do you want to pull up your weekly S&P
chart here and just show us where we are? Memory serves last week, we were still pretty far back
up into overbought territory. I'm presuming that that has continued as we've hit this new record
high here. Yeah, so two interesting points. So this is a little bit different chart than
I've kind of docked this up a little bit for our conversation today. So first of all, yes,
you can see by those red boxes at the top, I'm comparing two periods here. One is the current
period from November to where we are now, S&P 5000 at the point of this chart, we're at 55,014
on the index. Comparing this to March through July of last year, and what you'll see is two
very similar periods. Both periods very overbought, both top and bottom, that's those pink boxes.
The MACD buy signal kind of flipped back and forth at a high level, stayed that way for quite
some time. Same thing we're seeing right now with the S&P. Down at the bottom is the relative
strength index, it stayed overbought for an extended period of time as everybody was super
exuberant. Remember, what was the conversation in June and July of last year? Oh, it's AI. AI is
taking over everything. It's Nvidia, it's all these companies, it is all about artificial
intelligence. This is the same conversation we're having today. And the point is that we are now at
that same level where we then subsequently had a 5-10% correction of the market. And that was
bringing me to these charts a second ago that I wanted to show you. Because in order to kind
of look back at that period, we need to talk about kind of a rational exuberance that we're
seeing kind of going on in the markets right now. So what this chart is, is this chart takes
retail and institutional sentiment, right? So bullish or bearish, and allocation to equity
exposure. So it's not just how do I feel about the market, it's what I'm actually doing with my money.
So it's equity exposure on bullish or bearish side. So when that ratio is above two and a
half, which it is now, that has normally been near peaks of markets. It doesn't mean, again,
doesn't mean the market's gonna have a big major meltdown or anything like that. But it does suggest
that you're gonna have a period where you had a 5-10% correction, sometimes it's been more,
sometimes it's been 20. But normally, and again, you kind of see back in July of last year,
there's that spike that's coming up. And then you had that 10% decline that we've had this
rally again, and we're back above, you know, kind of a rational exuberance. So that just tells us
that everybody, basically, if everybody's on one side of the boat, it doesn't take much
to tilt the boat the other direction if people start kind of running in that direction.
And that's why you kind of get these corrections when they come. This chart looks at that same
sentiment index, and divides it by the VIX. So volatility measures fear. And, you know,
it's a function of buyers and sellers of put options in the market. So if there's a lot of
fear about a correction, volatility tends to go up because people are hedging for that risk.
If there's no fear of a correction, then volatility index is very low because nobody
thinks there's gonna be a crash. Well, right now, volatility is very low, bullish sentiment is very
high. So when you put those two together, you can get an index like this. And it shows us that
we're at very, very elevated levels of that index saying that basically nobody expects a crash and
everybody's in the boat. So again, when everybody's bought, Sam Stovall once said from S&P, he says,
if everybody's bought, then who's left to buy? And that's reasons why you will eventually get
some type of correction in the markets. This is our technical composite. So this is a weekly gauge.
So look, you get a lot of noise in daily data. So we build this gauge, this is in our newsletter
every weekend and we keep this updated every week along with our fear greed gauges and other stuff
that we publish in our weekly newsletter. So if you go to realinvestmentadvice.com and click on
the weekly newsletter, you'll see this every week. If you subscribe, you get it for free, I email it
to you. But this gauge is at 96.84 as of last Friday. So again, the markets are still going up,
so it'll be higher this week. Just to underscore it for people that can't see it, which is
this reading, which you're saying is now even higher, likely given this week's action,
it will be closer to 100. It's at one of the highest levels that we've had on record.
There was only one other period that was basically 2018 when we had the 20%
correction then. But again, this is a weekly composite of relative strength and
Williams percent, stochastics and everything all put to one index. So it runs from zero to 100.
It's at extremely high level. So again, it's just from a function of sentiment, technical positioning,
etc. Everybody's in the boat. Everybody is invested as basically all they can into the markets at this
moment. And we're just pushed that to an extreme. And again, this has been a very narrow
market. In fact, that's where I think we addressed this previously. But when you start
looking at things like performance of different markets and sectors versus
themselves, let me say this real quick. And while you're pulling it up, I just want to share a related
stat I saw the other day that the S&P's top stocks haven't been this concentrated in over 50 years.
Tuesday's article that's coming out is the importance of concentration.
So we'll have that article out this coming Tuesday. But if you take a look at this chart,
this is the performance. This went back to 2014. So this isn't a new thing. This is the NASDAQ
versus the S&P versus every other major market. So it's mid-cap, small cap, Russell 2000, oil, real
estate, international bonds, emerging markets, gold. Everything else is vastly underperformed
than NASDAQ stocks. And this is where the concentration point that you're talking about
comes from. But if you've been invested in anything other than the S&P, you have vastly
underperformed the markets over the last 10 years. And that has implications for
investors as well. So if you've been hanging on the gold, you haven't made any money. If you've
been hanging on the international emerging markets or real estate, hoping it's going to come back,
it's just vastly underperformed S&P. And that doesn't mean you didn't make money. I'm not
saying that. It's just that it vastly underperformed assets that were driven by a lot of speculation
because of zero interest rates, because of massive monetary interventions, quantitative easing,
and most of that speculation has occurred in the NASDAQ. And there is a massive deviation
between that. If you dig down into the S&P itself, same analysis. Every sector of the S&P has
underperformed the S&P but technology. But because technology is such a large chunk of the S&P
waiting, it's basically doing the yeoman's work of pulling the S&P higher while everything else
is dragging in the background. Yeah. I'm just going to share a couple of stats. I pulled these
numbers a few days ago. So these percentages are even worse after the past couple of days. But over
the past year, the magnificent seven are up like 70 something percent at this point in time. The
overall S&P is up 20%, 20 plus percent now. And to your point, pulling that up, making the S&P have
had such a great past 12 months has been those magnificent seven stocks. As you said, the S&P
is market cap weighted. If you look at the equal weight S&P, it's not even up 3% over the past year.
And if you look at the Russell 2000, it's negative. Exactly. Yeah. S&P is up 25% from
the October 2022 lows or whatever. Sorry. Yeah. From those lows, small caps are still in a bear
market. They haven't done anything since October lows of 2022. And again, take a look at earnings.
We're ramping up a bunch of the market right now based on better than expected earnings. But
the only companies that have earnings growth are the magnificent seven. Every other sector
and the other 493 stocks in the S&P actually have reduced earnings. They're missing earnings
estimates. They're having-- That's a really important chart. And one thing I want to note,
just so you can comment on it if you want, is we've been hearing about the magnificent seven
for a good long while as, "Hey, these are the stocks that are pulling everything."
And people like you who are veterans are saying, "Hey, weak breath is actually really bad for
markets." But I think the average person kind of doesn't care. As long as the numbers are still
going up, why care? Well, now everyone's kind of beginning to talk about the magnificent four,
where they're like, "Well, there's some other stocks in the mag seven that aren't doing so
great. Let's not look at Tesla so much anymore. Let's look at the guys that are still pulling
the weight." Well, the question happens, well, what happens when it comes to two and then one?
What happens when you run out of magnificence? So then everything gets pulled down.
Well, and that's really kind of the point I'm getting to. So this actual table from Goldman
Sachs kind of puts it in a good perspective because it's one thing to look at a line chart
and says, "Okay, here's the magnificent seven earnings going up and here's everybody else going
down." But if you take a look, the earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 are posting
a 14% year-over-year sales gain. The bottom 493 have a negative 110 bps. So they're not growing
sales. Again, it's all being pulled up. So the differential is that the growth of the S&P in
terms of net margin and sales growth is all being driven by those top seven stocks. And they are
growing. Even Tesla is still growing earnings and revenue. They're just not growing fast enough.
But that's the issue. And this is why, as we're looking at S&P 5,000, that's great.
It's great we're at 5,000. Starting on Monday, we're going to be reducing exposure to a lot of
stocks and rebalancing risk in a portfolio and raising a little bit of cash. Don't know when
we're going to get a correction. So we're not going to do a lot. We'll start, we'll do a little
bit here and a little bit there. But the goal will be, as the markets continue to push higher over
the next month or two months or however long it is, we're going to start using more and more of
that rally to reduce risk, rebalance the portfolio. Now, we're not getting out of the market. We're
not going to cash. And that's not what we're doing. We're just rebalancing risk. So we'll
sell big gainers. We'll look at our ones that aren't performing as well. We'll look at why
they're not performing. We'll either remove those or add to them if they're good companies and just
aren't performing. Look at adding to defensive sectors and reducing offensive sectors and getting
set up for what we think will be a fairly decent correction sometime over the next several months.
Okay, so you actually are now starting to put words into action in terms of,
hey, you see everybody on the same side of the boat, you see the rubber band stretched as far
as it's ever been stretched on the overbought side. And so you're starting to say, all right,
we're going to start taking some chips off the table. We're not leaving the table yet,
but we're starting to bring some of our chips in. All right, well, as always, at the end of this
discussion, Lance, we'll get into your specific trades that you made this week. And maybe if
there's anything else you want to say about the trades you're planning on making.
We haven't done any this week, so right now we're running the market, but yeah.
Okay, but maybe we'll talk at that point about which positions you're thinking you're going to
start selling next week. I've got too much to get through, so I'm already sort of jettisoning
some of the questions I have for you here, but I want to make sure we get to a couple of key
things, one of which was last week we mentioned your -- on retirement savings, retirement savers
piling into stocks. Is that a good idea? I'm going to presume it's probably an even -- you like that
idea even less, given how stretched the rubber band is right now. Before we get there, just a
couple of quick updates for folks. One, you briefly mentioned the weekly RIA newsletter that you guys
published. You showed some of the charts that are in every newsletter. I just wanted to thank you
and give your team props for allowing us to start including your newsletter in the email that I send
out to everybody on Saturdays when I send them the link to this video. As most folks know,
I write up my detailed takeaways from the long-form interviews I do on this channel.
Those Adams Notes, my version of Cliff Notes, those go out to the premium subscribers of our substack.
I don't have the chance to write those for these discussions with Lance just because there's not
enough time between when Lance and I actually film this and the editing is done versus when
the emails have to go out on Saturday morning. So to try to give some additional value to folks
on the day that we launch one of these videos, I asked Lance and his team if they wouldn't mind
if I included their newsletter at the bottom of the email that I send out. They said yes,
we did it last week. We got a lot of great feedback on it. Lance, folks really enjoyed it.
So just wanted again to thank you and your team for letting us do that.
This weekend is going to be good too because we're talking about market breadth. So it kind
of goes right along with this conversation. Great. Look, I am so confident, Lance,
that there is no topic that I can't bring up that you are not writing an article on it.
I try to read your mind. I try to make sure I'm ahead of the curve most of the time.
Well, it's one of the advantages to have a very simple empty mind is I think I'm an easy book for
you to read. All right. A couple of quick other just updates for folks. One, it's been a busy
couple of weeks in a really fun way. And one of the things that happened over the past week,
week and a half is I was invited by the folks at Zero Hedge. Zero Hedge has started these debates.
I think they've only done two of them so far, but they're massive. I think their last debate
was watched by over 5 million people. They are going to do their first economic related debate
next week. It's going to be Tuesday night, 7 p.m. Eastern, 4 p.m. Pacific. It's going to be about
the fate of the US dollar, and they invited me to moderate it. And it's a great panel on the pro side
for the dollar is going to be Brent Johnson of Dollar Milkshake fame and Michael Every of
Rabobank. On the con side is going to be Jim Rickards and Bob Murphy from the Mises Institute.
So folks, that should be really interesting. I'll be hopping a plane in a couple of days.
We're going to actually shoot that live in a studio. It should be really fun and well produced,
but keep your eyes out for that. Secondly, I was talking with you, Lance, before we turned the
camera on here. I had my first invitation to appear on like a major mainstream financial TV
show. Charles Payne invited me briefly on his program there on Fox Business. Really hard for
a guy who's used to having an hour or more to fully flesh out his thoughts to have to cram into
like a two minute segment and just talk in pithy little sound bites. You do it all the time. So
you're a master at it. But it was definitely a different experience for me. But Charles was
very, very kind. I wanted to go through on this discussion today with you on the massive amount of
work I put in to the tome of information I was going to try to share in those two minutes,
which of course I got to share like 1% of it. But a lot of great points here. But this is one
of the things I'm going to punt for next week. But I will give you the punchline or the theme,
which was, hey, if this doesn't feel like a strong economy to you, we're being told everywhere,
hey, it's Goldilocks, massive GDP growth, inflation's done, job market's super strong.
That is just not matching many people's daily lived experience. And I think people are really
beginning to feel kind of gaslit by this. So I go into kind of the data that says, hey, if you're
feeling like they're telling you the sun's shining, but you're feeling like it's raining, you're not
crazy and you're certainly not alone. So if we've got time next week, we'll dig into that. But if we
can, Lance, let's pull up your retirement piece there because I think that's very relevant to most
of the people who are watching today. And it sounds like, and I don't want to put words in
your mouth, but it sounds like you're saying, if you've got to really count on your money for
retirement, yeah, maybe the gains that equity investors are enjoying right now, especially in
those MEG7 stocks are looking really tasty, but this may not be the time to jump in the pool
because this may be getting closer to the point where things start to reverse.
Well, yeah. Okay. So I got to be real careful with you because you're always super bearish.
All right. Well, stop growing as fast. I don't know.
No, no, no. My point is that, and again, we'll get into this, is that this is about longer term
issues. And there's a big difference. If you're 30 years old, like I get emails from your viewers
that are 25, 28, 30 years old. And like, Adam's really got me worried about A, B, or C. I'm like,
"Dude, you're 28 years old. Take your money, put it in an S&P index, dollar cost average
of that every single month with 30% of your income and call me in 30 years when you retire
and I'll manage your money for you." Because you don't need to worry about this stuff. If you've
got 30 years ahead of you, don't worry about any of this stuff. Put your head down, do your job,
earn a bunch of money, and save 30 to 40% of your income. You will have nothing to worry about the
rest of your life. And just to be clear, totally agree with that. Folks at that age, exercise your
earnings and savings muscles, the investing stuff will take care of itself. I would say, look,
largely follow what Lance says, have some portion of your money that you're putting away in
investing that maybe has some risk-managed protection against it just in case you don't
get wiped out if you start at the wrong period of time. But Lance is very right, which is if you've
got that much trajectory, the market will take care of you over that long of a period. Really
focus on what you can put in. So we're not philosophically divided here, Lance.
Yeah. But when it comes to people that are in their 45, their 48, their 50,
and they've got some money saved up and they're going into retirement, that's a different story
because if we do, and we will, have another 30 or 40 or 50% correction at some point,
and when that happens, it could be five years from now, it could be 10 years from now,
it could be 15 years from now. Predicting those types of things are very, very difficult. But
at some point, we're going to have a meaningful correction of some sort.
And sorry to interrupt again, but I just want to underscore,
more than two thirds of this viewing audience is 45 and older. So that's why we focus so much on
this. Right. And so this article is for those individuals. So Bloomberg recently took a poll
and what they came up with, they said, "What are you going to do to hedge for inflation
for future retirees?" And they said, "Well, 46% of them are putting in the stocks,
29% some other way, 19% said they're not doing anything, 6% said they're putting in the goal."
It makes complete sense because stocks have been a better hedge for inflation than gold or
anything else at this point. So understand that after the last 15 years, when you're throwing out
12, 13% rates of return every single year, it makes complete sense why they've all been trained
now to just stick money into the S&P. We'll get into that in a second. They also believe that
stock prices and home prices will go up over time. So they'll appreciate 33% of them thought stocks
and real estate will appreciate more than bonds or anything else. And there again, based on recent
history, they're absolutely right. And this is the point I was making to you earlier. So this is
the market over a very, very long period of time from 1928 to 2023. This is as end of year 2023.
The market averaged 8.45% a year. 1928 to the dot-com bubble strip out the whole secular bear
market from 2000 to present 9.25%. Basically 8% from '73 to 2023. So basically, however you want
to break that timeframe up, the market returned about 8% on average over time. Now when you say
that, that is 6% appreciation, 4% dividends on average, subtract out 2% inflation, you get 8%.
That's how you get that 8% number. Since 2009, we've tacked on an additional 4% above that. So
50% increase over the rate of return from 1928 to present has been ramped up. And that's all
that monetary stimulus, QE, zero interest rates, all that. So this is why everybody in the market
today is like, "Man, I just put my money in stock market. It just goes up. It's a no-lose situation.
I'm going to make 15% a year." Because that's what they've seen for the last years. And this was also
ironically the very same thing we saw with people saying in 1999 as well. Because from 1990 to 1999,
the market was cranking out 15% a year. So why not be in stocks? And then it ends.
And that's the whole point of this. There's a reason that investors are doing this is because
they're undersaved for retirement. CNBC did a survey and they said, "How much do you think
you need for retirement?" People in their 20s thought 1.3 million. People in their 50s thought
1.6 million. If they were over 70, they needed about a million. So on average for all ages,
they thought they needed about 1.3 million. The problem is that the vast majority of people have
absolutely hardly anything saved for retirement. And that's by virtually all income groups.
And so when you start talking about $500,000 or more, only 9% of the population has got there.
If you need 1.3 million, you're way far away. So this is why individuals are going, "I need
more money into stocks to try to make up for my shortfall in savings. I'm not doing my job on my
savings side, but I'm hoping the stock market's going to make up the difference." And so we're
taking on an exceptional amount of risk. And again, that increase in the stock market is
directly correlated to the massive amount of stimulus that we put into the market. So again,
my question to you earlier was, is in order to sustain this, in order to continue to have
that exponential growth, you've got to continue to have this type of stimulative spending. I'm
not saying they can't do it, but it seems that that's going to be a much harder challenge going
forward. And when that stimulative spending runs out, you're going to wind up, and this is that
chart I was showing you earlier, you're going to wind back up into a secular bear market period
where, again, what is the secular bear market? That doesn't mean you get no returns. It means
that you have a 30 or 40% downturn, you have a rally of 30, 40, 50%, then you have another 20%
downturn, and you look back over a decade and your return is zero. Because there's been some great
rallies to trade off of, but there's been big bear markets during that period that wiped out all of
your returns. Right. Just to underscore one important part there, which is that's where the
passive approach really falls apart. Right? Passive approaches work great in those secular
bull markets. Everybody's used to that. They've been trained that passive is the way to go now.
So if we do indeed enter a secular bear market, that's where the past. So basically, if we do
enter a secular bear market, you really want to think about taking a much more active approach,
because to your point, you can make money in those environments, but generally not using a passive
playbook. That's right. And look, this is why passive investing has become such a big thing
over the last decade. Passive investing now has more assets than active management and
absolutely should. You've had 14 years of just this market just goes higher every single year.
So that's why we've gotten here. But again, and it's interesting because you talk about,
and this is my article coming up on Tuesday, kind of reminiscing about the Nifty Fifty.
A lot of the things about market concentration, about AI is the next big thing and it's just
going to take over everything. Those are the same conversations we had with the dot com bubble. That
was the same conversation we had with the Nifty Fifty. The Nifty Fifty back in the 70s was like,
these are the companies generating all the money. Just invest in those companies. They're the future.
And then you had the 1973-74 bear market that just put a nail right through that whole thesis. So
we're seeing exactly the same psychology that we see at every peak previous period where people
thought, oh, this time is different. AI, computers, dot com, whatever. There's always a new revolution.
Space race back in the 60s and 70s. You know, there's always a new revolution of something
going on. And we all believe that this is going to be the never ending story of a bull market,
but it will end. And now I'm not look and don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that we're about to
have a big bear market that next year this is going to happen and you need to be all in cash.
I'm not saying that at all. This market can continue to grind higher for a lot longer than
you think. Nobody knows what will trigger a bear market. What we do know historically is that one
will occur, but it could be 10 years from now. We're about 10, we're basically about 12 years
into this second or bull market period. These periods in the last 18 to 20 years. So there's
potentially a long runway left in this market. Eventually, we'll go through a period that
rectifies some of these issues, but it could be a very long time. So you don't want to sit there in
cash, trying to wait it out, waiting for the opportunity. Don't do that.
All right. So to the 45 plus audience that's watching this right now and has heard you say,
"Hey, this may not be the time to just go whole hog into stocks to try to make up for any
shortfalls you have in your savings goals." And you're also saying, "Hey, just don't run to cash."
What would you say to them? Well, you invest prudently. You don't have your whole portfolio
invested in Nvidia, as an example. You build a well allocated portfolio, you manage the risk of
the portfolio. But more importantly, that's just a very small piece. All your portfolio is supposed
to do is just try to adjust your portfolio at the rate of inflation, which is 3% right now.
So your goal should be to create 3% out of your portfolio. And then everything else in terms of
growth of savings comes from what you're saving from your business. So if you build a portfolio
to generate a 3% or 4% rate of return over time, you can do that very safely without taking on an
exorbitant amount of risk. The people that are going to lose 30%, 40%, 50% of their portfolio
whenever this event occurs, whether it's next year or 10 years from now, they're going to
lose that because they have money aggressively invested in overpriced, overvalued equities.
And so if you look in your portfolio and your portfolio is full of stocks that are trading at
30 times price of sales, you're going to have a problem when this occurs. You build a portfolio
to generate 3, 4% a year, and you're saving 30 to 40% of your income, you will get through
retirement. You will be in retirement safely and you'll be able to live through that retirement
with no problem at all, regardless of what the market does. Yeah. All right. Well, look,
I know I'm sort of talking our usual book here, but for most people for whom that logic sounds
makes a lot of sense, but are asking themselves, "Okay, but how do I do that?" This is why you want
to find a good professional financial advisor who can come up with this plan to work with.
Look, my job is to try to meet hurdle rates. So in other words, you do a financial plan
and they say, "Okay, you need 5% to reach your goal." My job is to build a portfolio that will
do that, maybe even exceed that would be nice. And so we try to exceed those goals. So if I can,
in 2021 or whatever, the market was up 22, we were up like 18, that's great. I can lock in
long-time returns. 2022, the market's down 20, we're down about eight, nine. That's great.
We can lock in returns that way. But again, if you're banking on beating the market every year,
that's where you get yourself into trouble. You build a portfolio to generate a set rate of return
but if you can do better than that, that's awesome. The trick is not to lose 50% of your money.
Right. And as we've talked about many times, the overall objective is to get a good sense
at the start in terms of what you need to meet your goals and not get distracted by what the
market's doing in any particular year. Because as you've said many times, people oftentimes will
self-sabotage themselves the most if they only need 5% but then they see their neighbor getting
15% in some darling stock at the moment and so they figure, "Oh, I got to chase that." And then
that stock corrects and then they're worse off than they were if they had just stuck to their
knitting, right? That's correct. Yeah, that's right. And look, the media has done a fantastic
job of converting the entire market into a giant casino. And so that's the way we treat it. I mean,
as individuals, we all just treat the market as a big casino. It's red lights and green lights
every day and bells and whistles going off and somebody's getting the bells ringing over here
for some guy that just bought a stock that went up 50% overnight or whatever. And so we got, "Oh,
we got to go do that." It's just we've lost the whole point of why we invest, which is to buy
assets that are undervalued, have them appreciate over time and sell them at a higher price. We've
lost that whole analysis about investing. But that's the problem that we'll have to deal with
at some point in the future and what separates the winners from the losers. And look, there's
great examples of this throughout history. If you were 45 in 1999, by the time you had any rate of
return, you're now 58. So if you weren't saved for retirement at 45, you're now 58 with no more money
than you had when you were 45 and you're facing retirement. But that's what a secondary bear
market period will do to you. It's not the one commodity you can't get more of and that's time.
I'll forget is that we can always make up losses, right? Making up losses is easy. We can always get
back to even. That's not making money. But the one thing we don't get back, if we spend five years or
10 years getting back to even, that's great. We don't get the five to 10 years back. That's the
one commodity that's more precious than anything else we have in investing is time. And maybe that's
really the way to be looking at your relationship with your financial advisor or if you're looking
at multiple different advisors and trying to figure out who to work with is saying, "Okay,
which guy is actually going to save me the most time versus make me the most money?"
All right. So there's a point I want to get to, but I think I might want to get to it using the
bridge of the chart you showed earlier that showed how much people believe they need for retirement.
And I think those expectations sadly aren't too far off and probably maybe even on the low side
for a certain amount of people. You need a million or more if you really want to retire, meaning
I'm going to live for 20, 30 plus years without any income, if I've got to live off my savings.
And then you contrast that with just the altry amount that the majority of people
have saved for retirement. We've talked about this a fair amount. So this actually is a big
reason why I founded Thoughtful Money. I think I've shared in the past that my folks got divorced
when I was real young. My mother got custody. She did not have much of a financial background
at all. And I saw her struggle growing up in the house that she ran. And in retrospect, now that I
know a lot more about finances, I saw her make a lot of bad mistakes and saw how stressful money
was in her life and saw how she got to retirement age without any retirement savings and how
that's not a fate I would wish on anybody if they could avoid it. So a big part of what we're trying
to do on this channel is to help educate people how to be more successful wealth builders so that
they can avoid fates like that. But when you look at those stats, Lance, that's where I really get
worried about society, which is that we're just unprepared and under-invested for the future that
we're heading into. To me, at its core, it just seems like a math problem. And I wonder, because
you spend your days with people trying to save for their futures. How much does that concern you from
a societal standpoint? A lot. Because we don't teach -- this goes back to all the
conversations we've had previously. We don't teach the fundamental basics of building wealth.
It's great that we have this conversation every week, but it's not really helpful in that term.
I mean, we should almost be doing a weekly show on, "This is how you invest in real estate."
You're going to kill us because as you and I have talked about, we want to create that type
of video and everyone's going to say, "Yes, do that next week." This isn't going to
happen next week. What I'm just saying is that that's the channel that we should build,
ultimately, which is a class every week about how to invest, how to manage your money, how to
budget, how to create better financial incentives for yourself, things that you can do.
We don't teach those things, and people wonder why they don't have any money. And look,
social media is a huge culprit of all this. If you really want to save money, put social media down.
Because A, you're wasting time on social media you could be using to make money with,
but also B, you're constantly being inundated with, "Buy this, buy this, buy this, buy this."
And it's easy. I just buy it, it hits my credit card or my debit card, whatever.
And I really don't see the money go out and stuff shows up at my door. It's fantastic.
But we have so much leakage within our financial situation that we can't save any money.
And so it's always interesting when I tell people, it's like, "You need to save 30% of your income."
It's like, "Well, I can't do it." Well, have you tried? Well, you can't do it because you're not
willing to sacrifice having a $2,000 iPhone and having a laptop and having internet and having
whatever. All of these things that we think we need to have, do you really?
Are there other alternatives? What's keeping you from saving money? And it's always the
differentiation between my wants and my needs. What do you need to live versus what you want to have?
And the wants need to go in a bucket that says when I can afford those, after I've saved 30%
of my money, I'll go buy that. Right. And we need to be honest about what truly is a need
versus a want. There's a lot of things that we feel we need, but they're not really essential.
Yeah. Do you need an iPhone or would a $20 flip phone work just as well? I mean, it's not cool.
Your friends are going to ostracize you, but if they're going to ostracize you for a $20 phone,
are they really your friends? And the most important lesson I try to teach my kids
every time I see them, right? And when they're with their friends, I always ask them, I say,
"Is that the person that's going to make you a better person in five years?"
And they ditch friends on a pretty regular basis because of that. Because the people you surround
yourself with today is the person you're going to be five years from now. And if you surround
yourself with a bunch of broke ass kids that are people that have all their, they spend all their
money, they're dead up to their eyeballs and they're trying to keep up with the challenges,
that's exactly where you're going to be in five years.
Well, so this is taking the conversation where I wanted to take it, which is behavior is destiny,
right? The choices I make today determine where I'm going to be tomorrow. And I'm taking this
somewhere, but let me just ask you this. So when you look at that math that you put up there,
right? That people have 5% or less of what they think they're going to need to retire.
Even those that are in the 55 to 64 cohort that are just about to hit retirement age,
the gap between what they really need versus what they have is still massive.
What's that going to look like? That's really what I want to kind of get your opinion on here,
which is we've had this society where retirement, like being able to stop working,
it's a relatively new construct for the masses, right? I mean, yeah, if you were Vanderbilt or
Rockefeller, sure. But a hundred years ago, there weren't that many people talking about
retirement. I don't even think the word retirement was really a word back then.
We also died at 65 to 72.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, we didn't have to live as long, right? Their savings didn't have to
do as much heavy lifting, right? Maybe that was a blessing.
Well, we'll talk about that more if you want. So we've had this sort of halcyon couple of
generations where folks could stop working and then social security contributed as well.
And so we had a lot of people who could sell their house, buy a condo in Florida and play
shuffleboard for a couple of decades, right? We may be entering a period where the number
of people or the percentage of people who can do that becomes substantially less, maybe even
drastically less than what it was. What does that look like in society?
Well, I mean, it's got two problems with it. One is that what's supposed to happen in society
is that, okay, let's just take me as an example, right? So I'm almost 60. I run a successful
business along with my partners. Very blessed, right? This is the fourth business I built.
Very, very blessed to have had the opportunities to create and use capitalism to my advantage.
Now, in theory, I should be retiring at 65. And then I pass that opportunity to somebody
else in my organization. I'm not talking about giving it to my kids. I'm not saying that.
But just say I'm working for a company and the CEO retires, that job should then be opened up to
whatever vice president's in line. He moves up. And then the guy that's below the vice president,
he moves up to that spot. And there's this migration of jobs up as the older guard retire.
Well, the problem is, is that because we're all now living longer, it's basically robbing a lot
of our youth of opportunity because they're not able to move up in those jobs because that old
bastard won't retire. He's just going to stay up there forever and he won't quit. And so since he's
going to keep working longer and longer and longer, there is this problem that we're kind
of robbing our youth of those opportunities to advance in their workplace until much later in
life. So that means that they're not creating the income growth. So when I was growing up,
you kind of hit peak maximum income growth in your mid 40s. We're now starting to see that move up
into the 50s before people are hitting their maximum income growth. So that's kind of what's
happening in society because of this aging of our environment. The other problem is, of course,
is the immigration issues, et cetera, that's robbing our youth of jobs as well. And so we're
really, we're really impacting the younger generation negatively on multiple fronts because
of, you know, with monetary policy and all these type of things that have elevated cost of, you
know, maintaining what is considered to be a normal life. And then also this aging demographic
issue, which is keeping them from being able to have the opportunities they need to increase their
incomes. You're perfectly teeing up the rant for this week, just FYI, just so you know. All right,
so let me, so my underlying concern here, which it sounds like you share, is that we are setting
ourselves up for, I think, kind of a variety of societal, what do you want to call them, ills,
undesirable ramifications from this, it's going to be piling up of seniors that just sadly can't
afford to stop working. And of course, you know, as they have health issues and what are you just
gonna have a lot of people that begin to fall into the, I can't not work, but I also can't work. Like
I'm just not healthy enough to do it. And that's going to create a big societal issue to be dealt
with, that I just don't have a lot of faith is going to be dealt with gracefully in ways that,
you know, pleases many of the participants. So anyways, I want to use that as an analogy now
for what's happening at the national level. So we've had public statements from Fed chair,
Jerome Powell, and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that have basically said, "Hey, you know
what? The country is not on a sustainable fiscal path and we need to get our fiscal house in order."
So Powell specifically said that the US is on an unsustainable fiscal path amid record high
national debt. It's "past time to address our national debt." And then Yellen said,
"It's crucial that the United States get its fiscal house in order. It's critically important
that the US be on a fiscally sustainable path." So what's so interesting is we have these people
that are running the ship of state that we're looking to be running the best
policies and they're kind of pointing fingers at each other saying, "Hey, I'm doing my job right,
but you guys need to get your act in gear." It's not the Fed and it's not the
Treasury, it's Congress. It's Congress and the administration. Just take a look at this recent
border bill. 118 billion dollars and 20 billion went to the border. I mean, stop spending money
on just everything. So I agree with you and we can we can rant on that and I want to
mention this headline by Nomura which says that the administration is "all gas, no breaks"
on economic reflation. It's running it hot into the election, which it says is wrecking Powell's
plan, which is one reason why I can understand that Powell is kind of angry here.
But my point is whether we like it or not, it is happening. We've got
many of the players on the chessboard at the highest levels saying, fiscally at least,
we're running in a direction that is running things off the rails, which I'm sort of
tying it to what we just talked about demographically, which is saying, "Hey, we've got
seniors that are running headlong into a retirement that they clearly don't seem to be able to afford.
Are we doing the same thing nationally here?" Yeah, absolutely. And look, this isn't a Republican
Democrat issue, so don't take away from this conversation that the Democrats
are the ones spending all the money and the Republicans want to cut. No, they all want to
spend money and they may talk a good game, but when I did political talk for over almost a decade, I
tell you, I interviewed all these guys and they're all like, "Oh yeah, we're going to cut spending as
soon as you get elected that's spending off the rails." So don't fall into any of this game about,
"Oh, we're going to cut spending and we're going to do this on the budget," because if they did,
if any of them actually had the colonists to do that, we would have a budget, we wouldn't be using
continuing resolutions and we could cut spending, but nobody wants that to occur. Because again,
look, Biden just forgave billions of dollars worth of student loan debt. Sounds great, right?
Somebody's got to pay for it though. And you may agree with these, and look, this isn't political.
You may agree with the policies, you may not agree with the policies. Well, it's political, it's just
not partisan. I agree with you. I'm just saying, I'm not picking a side. I'm just saying, look,
they're all not helping. And all the talk that they have about, "Oh, we're going to do this and
we're going to do this," it's all not real because at the end of the day, you know it's a problem
when you can't pass a bill. Like I want to fund, just let's pick the border, right? I want to put
$50 billion towards securing the border, right? And you have one bill, one item, and that's it.
Nope, we got to pack everything into it. Yeah. You got to have all this other stuff to just even
get it passed because that's all the payoffs, right? These bills, the reason they're structured
that way is because in order to get the votes, I've got to go to Adam and say, "Adam, I need
you to vote for this bill." Well, Adam goes, "Well, I don't support your border." But Adam,
what would it take for you to support the bill to secure the border? "Oh, well, I'll tell you what,
if you give me 20 billion for my pet project in California, then I'll vote for it." That's
how it happens, right? This is why these bills are that way. We can't just have an honest
conversation and say, "We're going to pass a bill for this deed." And you think about this, right?
I mean, $118 billion, we could solve homelessness for $4 billion. We could solve healthcare for
Americans for probably 20 to 30 billion. I mean, the amount of money that you're spending in this
one bill, and I forget about securing the border because Texas is doing the job itself. So let them
do their job, give them a little help. Well, and sorry also too, but this proposed bill too,
I mean, there's still massive quotas of illegal immigrants that are allowed. It doesn't really
solve the problem, yeah. It doesn't secure the border at all. That's irrelevant. But my point
is that out of 118 billion, 20 billion of it is directed towards the United States, right?
The rest of it is going to foreign countries. Now, again, I'm not saying we
eliminate all foreign spending, et cetera. I'm not saying that. My point though is,
is that we could solve so many of these problems if we would focus on domestic policy first,
international policy second. But we always have it backwards. And again, this is why,
but we've got such a divided Congress. And again, it's all this talk, but all this debt
is going to lead to the following, slower economic growth, wider gaps in economic prosperity between
the rich and the poor, lower rates of inflation to deflation over time, lower interest rates,
which aren't good. The lower your interest rates are, the less economic growth you have over time.
So all this leads to a worse outcome for you. You may agree with these policies and that's fine. I
don't care if you agree or disagree with what's going on in Washington. All I'm telling you is,
the debt and the deficit is going to make your life worse. None of this is going to
provide you with better economic prosperity over the long term.
Thank you. Because that's where I was taking the switches. We talked last week,
I asked you the question, given that maximum fiscal spending is now business as usual,
will anyone have the political appetite to rein that back in? I think you and I both sort
of concluded no, probably not. So like it or not, this is where things are headed. So
we can either ignore it and just have a false hope that someone's going to come resolve it,
or we can prepare for it. We can say if this is where the puck is headed nationally,
what can I do to make sure that I'm not collateral damage for that? You just lined out where you
think this is really headed, slower economic growth, probably likely deflation over time,
just fewer things are going to get done, fewer things are going to get passed,
probably a lot of benefits that were promised in the future aren't going to materialize,
whatever that list is. So once we know that, maybe we don't like it, but we can say, "Okay,
well, I can start planning around that," and that's the value of trying to see the future
more clearly. So that's where I wanted to clarify for folks. No, no, and that's a great point,
because if you're approaching retirement, you're like, "Okay, look, if I can get..." I've had this
chart up the whole time around what people expect to need for retirement versus what they currently
have. So when I bring this up, I invariably always get this email. This email will come in,
I'll have this email tomorrow. But Lance, because I'll have X dollars a month on Social Security
and Medicare, so I don't need that much money saved up because I'll have that. What if it's
not there for some reason? I'm not saying it's not going to be there, right? The worst thing that we
could see happen in this country is that Social Security actually goes bankrupt. I mean, there
will be millions of people living on the street, because there is a vast number of Americans that
depend on Social Security for 50% of their retirement income, and a lot of them have
depended on it for up to 90% of their income. So the destruction of Social Security has massive
implications. But the point is, is just what if it's not there? Why prepare your whole retirement
banking on a government handout? Yes, I know you paid into it and you think you deserve it. I'm not
disagreeing with that. I'm just saying, what if it's not there? I mean, we're giving it to illegals
right now. So that's more money out of the kitty that's not going to be there for you down the road.
So why would it not be better to plan for the worst and hope for the best? And how do I plan for
the worst? Make sure that you're saving enough to have enough saved up for retirement, that it can
generate its own income stream. Buy assets that can generate an income stream. Buy things that
can protect assets over time. Provide tax-free withdrawals. Do those type of things. Provide
you some ability to navigate better. Guarantee you an income in life, like annuities. I can
put money into a guaranteed income annuity and have a guarantee I can secure for retirement.
But why bank your whole retirement on a handout from the government? What if it's not there? See,
that's the risk. And look, if it is there now, look, and I'm not saying it's not going to be
there. So don't go run off and say, "Why is it so serious and bankrupt?" I'm not saying that.
What I'm saying is, why bank on it just in case? If I prepare for my retirement and I've got my
whole retirement secured and I get social security, bonus. As my son would say, bet. Because that's
just extra money I get to spend now. That's awesome. And if something happens down the road,
I don't have to worry about taking care of myself or my family. All right. Well, hopefully, we've
really beaten this horse to a bloody pulp at this point in time. But again, folks, this is a huge
part of why Lance and I do this on a weekly basis is we want to try to make folks as aware as
possible as to what the reality is on the ground so that you can make more informed decisions.
All right, Lance, I want to get to our rant, then we'll wrap things up. Real quick, though,
you mentioned it sounds like you didn't make any trades over the past week, but you're planning on
making trades this week. Any other additional detail about the type of plans? Do you have
a sense of which securities you want to sell or any parts of your strategy you want to do?
Yeah. So we own some of the Magnificent Seven as a good example. So we own Nvidia and AMD and
Microsoft and Google in our portfolio. They've had huge runs. So now the way we run our portfolio is
everything has a weight. So we have a maximum weight and a minimum weight. So a lot of these
companies and other good companies have a huge run as AbbVie Healthcare in the healthcare space.
These stocks have had massive runs and they are now have a bigger weighting than their target.
So we'll reduce those back to their target weight rate and keep that cash.
We have some other positions that are really good quality companies that have not participated in
this rally, but they throw off a good dividend. And if we get a rotation from risk to from risk
on to risk off, most likely we'll see a rotation to some more of those defensive type names.
So we'll look for positions that are underweight their target and bring those up to weight.
So again, it's not a massive selling campaign. We're not just liquidating everything going to
cash, but we're starting to reduce risk by rebalancing. And then if we start getting
sell indicators and those types of things that occur, then we can reduce equity exposure more.
We can short against the portfolio, what we call short against the box.
Some other things that we're doing like in some of our high net worth models is we're
writing option collars around certain stocks as well, because there's enough of a skew now
that's occurred within the options market that we can write profitable collars. In other words,
it doesn't cost us any money. We actually make money by writing a collar and we can lock in the
price. So there's a lot of things that we can do to start kind of preparing for an eventual
five to 10% correction so that we don't have to wait for the correction to start to then take
action. All right, great. And just a reminder to folks, Lance is on this channel every week. So as
he makes any changes to that strategy he just laid out, he'll share them here with us. So you'll be
kept informed in real time. All right, well, getting to the rant, there's actually sort of
two topics I wanted to talk about, both of which we could spend a long time on. The first one I
just want to spend just a minute on because it's notable and it's related to what we talked about
last week when we talked about how people were really beginning to lose faith in the mainstream
media and turning to alternative sources and sort of acknowledging some of the responsibility we
have, Lance, to create valuable content for viewers. I just want to note, because it's
material to that discussion, the interview that Tucker Carlson just released last night with
Vladimir Putin. And look, I don't want to get into the potential hornet's nest of who's right and
who's wrong and all that stuff. I just want to say it was a long form, serious discussion of a hugely
important issue. And we got to hear at length the detailed thinking of one of the most important
players in one of the most important issues that the world is dealing with right now.
And we didn't have that information beforehand. And I'm of the opinion that more information
is generally always better. And the populace can then evaluate all the different information
that's being put out by all the different sources and compare them against each other.
And hopefully, by doing that, come up with a better sense of what the truth is.
And so I thought that was a material milestone in the type of media that we're in, which is this
thoughtful, long form discussion of not trying to force a complex topic into just a couple of
sound bites, but to really let, in this case, one of the players put their full thinking on the
table. I would love to see something very similar replicated where perhaps a Russian journalist sits
down and interviews President Biden, or another journalist interviews Zelensky. And we can all
kind of crawl into their brains and hear what every player is thinking, and then decide for
ourselves where the information matches up and where it doesn't and do additional research.
Ironically, that's called journalism.
Yeah, it's called journalism. And so I thought that that was an important and I think,
positive step forward for journalists.
I'm surprised he's still alive, though, personally.
Poor content. Yeah, well, I mean, we'll see. And look, as you can see, I'm trying to take
care not to, say, endorse any one particular side or any particular person or party there.
But no, look, your point is, look, this is the problem that you and I have
doing this, even this commentary on Fridays, right? I have personal biases, like everybody
does. So I have personal biases towards certain things. And there are certain facts that I know
are true and factual. But there's always somebody out there willing to argue that, right? And so
because people have different biases and different feelings and thoughts. And whether they have the
right information or they have misinformation is basically generally where you garner it from,
from the internet. So the whole purpose of having a conversation is to present a side
of an argument and for you to either agree with it or disagree with it, but then go, OK.
And then this is what we talk a lot about investing is like, you know, don't just go
listen to all the bearish people and don't go listen to just the bullish people. Listen to
both sides, get both sides of the argument so that you can make a better decision about where
to invest your capital. The problem is, is that we're so personally invested now in defending our
narrative, whatever our personal narrative is, right? Whether it's immigration or gender or
whatever it is today, right? Whatever your climate change, whatever our personal narrative is,
whatever we want to believe. We are so defensive of that position that we won't even listen to
somebody else's opinion. Regardless of what it is, we won't even consider it because I'm so vested
in defending my position and I can't be proven wrong. I cannot be wrong about this position
because I got it from so-and-so, right? That's the problem we have in society today is that,
and that's why there's such a division, is because nobody's willing to communicate.
All we're doing is trying to yell over the other person to try to prove that we're right.
And the reality is, is that the truth always lies somewhere in the middle. Is there climate change?
Sure. There are certainly some issues about climate change that are occurring,
but a lot of the hyperbole probably is never going to happen. So there's a reality in the middle
somewhere. And if you haven't taken a look lately, I think what's going on with Toyota
and Tesla is a great example, right? If you take a look at what's going on with Tesla lately,
just as a function of this, right? So this was the EVs, the whole guy right there around climate
change and buildings, electric vehicles. Toyota is building hybrids. And if you go take a look at
Nvidia and Toyota, they're polar opposites, right? Toyota is soaring through the roof right now,
it's the next Nvidia, because the truth about vehicles and climate change wasn't electric
vehicles, it was the hybrid. And that was always where we should have started with to begin with,
but see, nobody wanted to ever have that conversation. And now investors are starting
to come along to this idea that hybrid technology and solid state, which is where Toyota is headed,
they've got a big jump on this curve, is ultimately going to probably be one of the
solutions down the road and Toyota is getting rewarded for that. But see, the truth was in the
middle. The truth was, yes, there's climate change. Yes, there's something we can do about it,
but it wasn't these polar extremes. It was in the middle. And I think we're going to see,
and that's where we should all be trying to get to as humans, is trying to figure out what the
common middle ground is, but we can't do that. That's why we can't have conversations.
I totally agree. If you're not talking and you're not listening,
that's not a path to progress. Exactly. Like I said, we could talk about this forever,
but I just wanted to note the importance of the milestones. The second is, my daughter recently
graduated from college. She graduated from Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, where if anybody knows
of that school, phenomenal school, it's a jewel of a resource out here in California. And it's quite
competitive school. It's very well known for being very rigorous in the STEM disciplines. And my
daughter's got a couple of friends from there who they're having a real challenging time finding
jobs coming out of there. And these are kids with engineering degrees. They're interested in
doing big stuff in engineering or with data, so jobs that are in demand.
And it goes back to what I was saying earlier about, we're being told how amazing this jobs
market is and that there's still way more openings than there are candidates. But if you talk to
people who've been losing their jobs in the layoffs that have been increasing over past
months, or you talk to recent college grads, you really hear a different story. You hear like,
hey, it's actually not super easy to get a job I want. You've mentioned many times that one example
of the person who sent out like over 1,000 resumes didn't hear back from one. So I'm beginning to see
more and more examples in my personal life of competent, credible candidates who are having
a challenging time getting hired. So anyways, I'm getting to one of my crazy ideas. I'd love to get
your reaction to it. So one of the bits of advice that I've been giving these kids is if they've got
the ability to do this, which your maximum opportunity to do it is when you're young and
you have no other obligations in your life. I'm like, look, if you're having trouble getting hired
for the job you want, create a short list of the companies you'd most like to work for, call them
up and say, you know what, I'm going to work for you for free for the next month or two. Let's talk
about a project that I can do for you that I will do free of charge. Because the currency you have
that's valuable at that point in time is your time. Most companies are not going to turn down
free help from an enthusiastic, bright, shiny person that wants to do the work.
So in a lot of those cases, if you get the company to say yes, you work for them for a month or two,
and you show them what you're capable of, you've removed a lot of the risk from the hiring decision
from them. But they'll generally either say, hey, you did really good work for us. And yeah,
now that you've proven you fit in well here, and we see what you can do, yeah, let's talk about
creating an opening for you here. Or they say, hey, you know what, I'd love to hire you, but
I just can't for reason X, Y, or Z. But let me reach out to some of my other peers in the industry
who I know might be looking for somebody. I'll give you a recommendation. And now you as the
candidate have real marketable experience at a big company in this space. And I've seen this happen
over and over again. I've used it actually in my own life. When I was in my 20s, it really paid off.
It's a great strategy, I think. I've got a bigger idea to build off it, but I'm curious. I'll take
a breath to get your thoughts. No, it is. It's called internships, and they're great. And look,
you're going to ask a lot of people, hey, can I come intern for you? And there's going to be a
lot of people that say no. But as the old sales saying goes, everybody says no, you're one closer
to a yes. You just got to keep asking people for that opportunity. And you sweeten the pot by making
it totally free. Hey, I'll do it. Look, there's a lot of companies that even if it's free, it's like,
hey, I love the offer. I just can't right now. I don't have the time to dedicate to you, or
whatever. There's going to be reasons why they say no. So just be prepared for that. But that's the
whole point of sales is that when you're making sales in real life, you're going to get a lot of
nos on a sale, but eventually you'll get a yes. It's just an odds game. So I just don't want you
to be discouraged that the first time you go out and ask for an internship, you get turned down.
So well, that didn't work out. I'm stupid. I'm just saying like, there's gonna be reasons why
they can't do it. But there's gonna be a lot of reasons they can. And again, you just got to get
to the right company, the right person and do it. But it's absolutely a fantastic idea. Internships
are awesome. I push my kids to do internships every year. And you know, it's and get it look,
get involved in business organizations. You know, the National Federation of Independent Business,
there's you know, the the Rotary Club, the Chamber of Commerce, get involved in those because those
are all business owners. So if you're looking to get in somewhere, get involved in the organizations
that they're involved in, and get to meet them. And all of a sudden, they go, Oh, yeah, you know,
that Jimmy kid, you know, he's he's sharp kid, you always hear it rotary every week, blah, blah, blah.
And when they start looking, and look, this happens in our businesses that when we when we
have a position that comes up, we need to fill, everybody starts thinking about who do we know,
there'll be a great fit for that job. And if we can't come up with somebody we know,
then we go out through the normal recruiting services, right and start trying to recruit
that way. But if there's been a diligent hand raiser, who's been hanging around and saying,
what can I do for you? Right? Yeah, he's the first guy you think of, right? It's like advertising.
Why does Geico advertise insurance 40 times a day on television? Because it's not that you
need insurance today. But when you do, it's like, I need to call for some insurance. I'll call it
Geico. I see him every day, right? It's all about repetition. And yeah, put yourself in front of
these people. And, and that's why we talk about mentorships, we talk about, you know, the network
of people and, you know, look, go to networking functions, a lot of people at networking functions,
they're just like you, they're all trying to find a job too. But you know what, if they get hired on
to somewhere else, and you've gotten to know them through networking, and they have an opening,
they're saying, Hey, I know a guy that might be a good or girl, right? I know a good person,
that might be a fit for this job. And that's just the way the world works.
Well, so let me get to my crazy idea, then. So the big part of this is rooted in, I tell this to my
daughters and their friends a lot, which is like, look, coming out of school, when an employer,
a potential employer has no other basis for judgment. Yeah, your degree and your college
kind of matter a little bit, right? But a couple months after that, they don't care.
All they care about is what you can do, right? It really to your experience, right? Like,
so what can you do for me? And in most cases, I went to quite good schools.
Once I was a year or so out of undergrad, nobody cared. Nobody asked me, right? They just want to
know what I could do. So that's one of the things I really like about this internship is you are
getting, even though it's free, you are getting marketable experience, right, which is going to
make you landing the next job. It's going to hopefully skyrocket your odds of landing the next
job. So here's my wacko idea, which is, as you were saying earlier, Lance, colleges have metastasized
to the point where they're just really expensive pieces of paper for way too many people, right?
You get out, you don't really have any marketable experience. Nobody cares about your diploma.
A lot of cases, those diplomas are in pursuits that nobody cares about anyway. Your employer
doesn't care about anyways, right? And the kid is saddled with a ton of debt, right?
And so I think -- and I'm seeing it in real time right now -- kids are really beginning
to question the value of going to college and making that commitment much more than they
had in the past. That is a huge mistake. Yeah, they're looking at it and saying, I think college
maybe would have been told is wrong, right? I'm told it's the pathway to riches, but I'm looking
at it. Yeah, but see, this is the wrong attitude. See, what people think about college is that if
I'm going to go to college, I'm going to walk out of college, I'm going to have a $100,000
a year salary that's going to put me in the corner office because I got this degree that says I'm a
psychologist or whatever, right? That's not what a college degree does for an employer. What it
tells an employer is that you can get up in the morning, you can commit to a project for a four
year period, you can do the work that's necessary, you're competent at the work because you got decent
grades and you were able to complete that task, graduate in four years or whatever the time frame
was, with this degree of skills. You don't learn crap in college about how to work a job, right?
One of the best lessons I ever got was from my commencement speech when I graduated college. The
guy said, you've spent four years in college, you know absolutely nothing as you go out in the world.
The only thing you have learned to do is to take a problem and go and find research on how to solve
that problem. That is all you've learned how to do. Now go out in the world and get experience.
And this is the point that people miss about the value of college. Their expectations are
misaligned with what the college degree actually gives you. If you're just wanting a high-paying
job, absolutely skip college, go to a trade school, learn to weld, learn to pipe fit,
learn to do plumbing, electrical, those will pay you six-figure jobs. And you'll do very well
in that trade going forward. You can build your own business out of it, do extremely well
with that trade. But if that's what you're wanting right out of school, then go get a trade school.
But if you're wanting a career, college degree isn't going to do that for you. What college
degree is always going to tell the employer is that you can wake up on time, make your bread,
and complete a project. So I agree with you. But I do see that employers are beginning to
change their opinions too, where they're like, with great inflations, and the way in which
colleges have really kind of capitulated to a lot of demands of the special snowflakes that have
been going through there. We're not even sure these kids have learned how to tackle and research
a problem. Even that basic assumption on the employer side, I think, is weakening. And here's
where we get to my crazy idea, which is, I think that at the end of the day, the real currency
is experience. And of course, the challenge every graduate has who has the fresh degree is like,
"Well, I've got the degree, but I don't have the experience. How can I get the experience I want
if I just have the paper?" Same thing happened to me when I graduated. Yeah. So my idea is,
I think, and I think this is going to happen organically. Yes, more kids will hopefully go
into trades. But I also think you will begin to have kids who strike their own deals with
employers rather than go to college. And they'll say, "Look, I'm 19. I can couch surf. I can live
on ramen noodles at this age. Company X, I will work for you for a year or two years for free."
And it's not an internship. It's an apprenticeship. It's, "I am going to give you
my full energies, and I'm going to figure out how to make it work economically, but you're
going to teach me the following things. And so by the time I am done with this year or two agreement
that we put together, I will have learned these fundamental parts of this business that I'm going
into. And at the end of that period, I'm going to be skilled enough that I'm going to be a great
candidate for a paid opening at your company, or I'm going to be able to go to one of your
competitors and say, "I just worked for Company X doing these things. I've learned these skills,
whatever. Hire me now." Right? And that's fine, except that's going to be jobs that are going to
be extremely limited in nature because you don't have the education for higher attainment. And
look, once you start trying to move up that ladder in the corporate world, that degree does matter.
And it specifically matters, particularly in fields that require a lot of mathematical skills,
etc. Like, for instance, you can't go to a law firm, work for two years for a law firm for free,
and then become a lawyer. No, there are some professions where you need the advanced degree,
right? But you could go to law school. You could go to law school. Right, yeah, but you still
got to wind up going to school and getting the thing and you got to pass the bar. You can't go
work for a hospital for two years and become a doctor, right? No, but -- Hold on, let me finish.
You can't go work for an engineering company for two years and become an engineer, right? Because
you got to be certified. So look, there's all these things and it sounds great. I'm not arguing
the point. Look, if you don't want to go to college, then cut this bargain to go get experience
because experience is important. What I would argue is, as you go to college, you cut that
deal during the summers to get experience during the summers, during the winter breaks, etc. When
you're not in college, instead of off, you know, during the summer, go get a job in the field that
you want to work, work for free during the summers, go back to school and get those math skills that
you need, get those science skills that you need. Because again, at the end of the day, it's like,
look, my son's in engineering right now. And his life is miserable because it takes him eight
hours to solve one problem because of the calculus that he's doing right now. And these are very,
very complex problems. And it's very tough, but this is how we students out of college very
quickly is these type of problems. But you're not going to learn that type of discipline and that
type of math skill working for free in the summers, right? That's just something you have to learn in
college. So totally agree. I'm not sure these ideas, well, first, I'm not sure mine is a good
idea. No, it's a good idea for some people. I'm just saying if your level of attainment in the
world is a much higher level, this isn't going to work. If you want to attain a level, then this
will work. You can certainly do that. But there's jobs you will never have access to without that
college degree. And that's just unfortunately, that's just how society runs. Yeah, that's true.
And it's super hard to get a master's degree if you don't have a college degree to build off of
that. So I totally agree with that too. But we're talking averages here. And there's a lot of people
who I think they're not going to be doing higher level calculus for their careers. And so not
getting saddled with a bunch of debt for not a very useful piece of paper, something like what
I'm talking about may work. And one of the things that kind of turned me onto this really early on
in my career was when I went to Merrill Lynch, big investment bank. And I noticed that all the
people at my level, the bottom rung, the financial analyst, you're right out of college, we all had
like Ivy degrees. Then if you looked at the associates who had to go get their MBAs and
then join in, there was still a fair amount of top schools, but there were less. And as you got
higher and higher up the ladder, you were getting just random schools you'd never heard of,
Rochester Polytechnic or whatever. And at the very top, I got to meet the CEO when I was there,
and I'm not even sure he had a college degree. So I mean, there are lots of parts, especially
of the business world, where you don't need to be doing advanced calculus to be a good manager.
And most of what you'll learn is on the ground, just solving problems and benefiting the expertise
of others. Absolutely. You cannot underestimate the value of experience. Look, and like I tell
my son all the time, you learn nothing in college, right? You don't come out of college with a skill
set. You learn that over time through experience, but you do learn how to do the requirements to
make that experience count the most. And that's the important thing is that we devalue. So we've
done two things very, very badly in our society. You know, back in the '40s and the '50s,
actually the '30s, '40s, '50s, a lot of men didn't even graduate high school. They had like
an eighth grade education, and then they went to work on the family farm or whatever it was.
Right. Or a construction site.
Construction site, whatever. And that's fine, right? They have an eighth grade education.
If you had a high school diploma back then, you were like, wow, Adams got a high school diploma.
He's the boss, right? We're putting him in, he's going to manage.
He's the foreman, yeah.
He's the foreman, right. And so that was because so few people had a high school diploma. So then
we said, hey, everybody should have a high school diploma. Well, once everybody had a high school
diploma, that diploma no longer has value. And so we said, okay, well, people need to have a
college degree. And so for a long time, a bachelor's degree was quite rare actually.
Right.
And it had a lot of values like, wow, Adams got a bachelor's degree in business. We're going to make
him the CFO of the company. And so then we said, well, everybody needs to go to college. And so now
everybody has a college degree. So now the college degree does, and this is why we're having this
conversation, all of a sudden the college degree doesn't have any weight because everybody has one.
It's always supply and demand. I said this 20 years ago. I said, the worst thing that we're
going to do is require everybody to have a college degree because that college degree doesn't have
no weight. And so now you've got to look at people and go, okay, do you have, look, even in my
business, right? It's great. You went to school. I'm glad you got a bachelor's degree in finance,
but do you have your certified financial planning certificate? Do you have your, you know, your,
your chart financial analyst, you know, do you have a master's degree because we won't hire you
unless you have those, those pedigrees because the college degree just doesn't cut it anymore.
And it's going to be the same thing eventually with masters. It'll be same thing eventually
with PhDs. And the more that we require everybody to do this, and this is the fault of the parents
and society and everybody else, because we pushed everybody to get in a college degree
is that we have diluted the importance of having that college degree. And so when you go to
put your resume in with five and the other problem that we've done too, is with companies like
LinkedIn and with indeed and career builder and all this and all these companies now, oh, just,
yeah, go online and fill out your application, you know, and we'll get around to it. So the
first thing you do is they put AI on it and they have a scan that kicks out everybody
that doesn't have the exact build of the resume that the AI is looking for.
And so a lot of people that are good quality candidates never even get a look
because every job is getting inundated with 10,000 resumes for one position. And that was
never the case before. And so, you know, we we've done technology and we've always talked about how
great, great technology is awesome. There's a very, very dark side to technology that we are
now starting to see, but people aren't willing to admit yet that that's the problem. All right. And
we got to leave it there. That is a rant for another day. But we're getting real long in the
tooth here. So I got to wrap things up. But thanks, Lance. Great discussion. The reason why I wanted
to bring this up was because, you know, we do have some younger folks that watch this channel,
even though so many are 45 plus, there actually are Gen Zers and young millennials that watch and
ask for more of this type of content. But also, like I said, you know, that two thirds of this
audience is older, yes, but they have children and adult children that are wrestling with the
same issue. Right. Which is, hey, I'm trying to get ahead. I'm trying to get hired. And this
market just does not seem as easy as we're being told, especially when we hear Jerome Powell talk
about the jobs market. And then of course, you know, if those of us that are worried that something
harder than a soft landing may materialize over the next year or two, that just makes job prospects
even more scarce. All right. So in wrapping things up, folks, just a reminder that the Thoughtful
Money Conference on Saturday, March 16 is coming up. We're still offering the lowest early bird
price discount. So if you're thinking of participating in the conference, make sure you
lock that in before it rises. And remember, if you're a premium subscriber to our sub stack,
you get 50 bucks off the conference, off that lower or that lowest early bird price discount.
So it only costs 15 bucks a month to sign up. So you can play that arbitrage, spend 15, save 50.
And a reminder to Rick Rule just signed on for the faculty as well. And if you haven't seen Rick at
the conferences in the past, he's great because Rick's such a phenomenal speaker to begin with.
But he shares usually like three or four dozen specific tickers. He just goes through his entire
watch list of the stocks that he owns and is monitoring and shares that with everybody. So
if you're looking for good natural resource investment ideas, Rick's going to give you plenty.
And just a reminder, as we do, and I think we did multiple times on this channel,
highly recommend that most people who are trying to navigate these markets and things from here,
work with a good financial advisor, who understands all the macro issues that the guests
on this channel talk about, as well as the ones that Lance and I do. If you've got a good advisor
who's doing that for you, being a good financial quarterback for you, excellent, stick with them.
But if you don't, you'd like a second opinion from one who does, maybe even Lance and his
team there at RIA, then fill out the short form over at ThoughtfulMoney.com and schedule a free
consultation with those guys. Like I said, it's totally free. There's no commitment to work with
these guys. It's just a free public service that they offer. And Lance, it's been great
to finally begin to start sending folks back out to you advisors. I've been getting lots of great
feedback, both from the people that are talking to you guys. But it just does my heart well to
know that people are getting good counsel from you guys. And I guess on that, I'd like to give
you the last word here, Lance. So anything you want to say about the conversations that you guys are
having with the people that are reaching out to you now? No, it's all good. And it's always
important to try to separate out what your needs are, what you think your needs are, versus what
your needs really are. And so we have a lot of people that come to us that they're young,
they're like, "Hey, I've been listening to this, and I want to invest in this." And we're like,
"Hey, just keep it simple. I'll send you a long email that says, here's the steps you need to
take. Start here, fully fund your Roth, fully fund your 401(k), set up a spousal IRA, get these things
funded. And then once you do that, then we need to start building an emergency fund. We need to
build up an investment account. Then you come back to me, and then we'll put your new proceeds
to work in a portfolio." So we try to help them out, not just saying, "Oh yeah, yeah, give me your
money. I'll manage it for you." Because it's not that we need clients, but we're fine. What we want
to do is try to do the right thing for the people that come to us to make sure they're doing the
right things financially to build their wealth. All right. Well, thanks so much. And again,
thanks so much for doing that. That's the huge part of the mission behind powerful money is to
educate and enable. You guys are a huge part of the enable part of that. So again, thank you for that.
And folks, if one of the best investments you make in your life each week is listening to this
