Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
Rumors are suddenly flying fast and furious that the Federal Reserve will soon be ending
its campaign of quantitative tightening, aka QT.
This is on top of the three rate cuts it recently guided the market to expect in 2024.
Is the end of QT indeed imminent?
And if so, what will the implications be?
To discuss that, as well as the other major macro trends expected to impact markets most
in 2024, we're fortunate to sit down with analyst Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research
and proud creator of a new ETF, the Bianco Research Total Return Index.
Jim, thanks so much for joining us today.
Well, thanks for having me.
Hey, always a pleasure.
Congratulations on the new ETF.
We'll talk about that in a few minutes here.
Lots of questions for you.
Like I said, I want to get into the whole, is QT really ending in the near future in
a moment?
Because everybody's abuzz with that right now.
But before we do, let me just kick this off with a general question I'd like to ask you
at the start.
What's your current assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
So I think as we sit here and talk, the economy is actually OK.
It's probably growing a trend, if not slightly above trend.
That's where it was in 2023.
There's a problem with that statement, though.
Because if you're growing a trend or above trend, that's going to give you a lot of demand,
and that could be a push on inflation.
So the inflation rates come down from 9% to 3.4, using CPI year-over-year basis.
And a lot of people are using this phrase that we're in the last mile, we're on our
way down to two.
I'm thinking we might have already seen the last mile, or very, very close to seeing the
last mile.
Inflation rate actually bottomed at 3.0% back in June, seven months ago.
Now it's 3.4.
If the global economy stays relatively OK, I don't want to say boom, but not a soft landing
or not a hard landing, that'll put a little bit upward pressure on inflation, and that
should keep inflation sticky, and that should maybe frustrate this idea that the Fed's going
to cut rates a lot of times, interest rates are going to come down more than people think.
Then on top of that, if you throw in some of the exogenous problems that we're seeing,
say with Red Sea shipping, possibly a turn in the housing market north, yes, a turn in
the housing market north by some of the data, you could definitely see a frustration that
the Fed may not wind up cutting rates five or six times.
So I'm a bit optimistic, and I understand that that's kind of an outlier opinion.
Bank of America, the day we're recording, put out their global fund manager survey.
59% of their fund managers expect a recession in the next 12 months.
I just participated in the Roundtable Prime at Double Line's offices in Los Angeles last
week.
Majority of the people there were very worried about the economy as well, too.
I was less so worried about the economy and more so worried about inflation.
Okay, so taking away from that, it sounds like you are guardedly bullish.
Is that a fair term to use for you?
Guardedly bullish on equities, you mean, or on the economy?
I guess I'd say the economy, it sounds like you're guardedly bullish on, I guess we'll
get to markets in a moment.
Obviously what will depend on, part of your answer is going to depend on what happens
with inflation.
You'd kind of like you're keeping an eye on it.
But right now it sounds like you're kind of guardedly bullish about the system.
Feel free to correct that in any way.
No, no, I am guardedly bullish.
I am guardedly bullish on it because I think what's changed about the economy post-pandemic,
one of the things I've argued is that every so often we have these major events, the financial
crisis, the lockdown restart, and I use those words because that's really what the event
was of the global economy, that it either speeds up or changes trends.
I think it's changed some of the trends.
We know about the remote work trend.
But one of the things that it also seems has changed is this attitude about spending.
2010 to 2020, coming out of the financial crisis, equity markets went up, home prices
went up.
To keep the example simple, you got your brokerage statement, you looked at it and you said,
"Wow, I got more savings because my portfolio went up.
What are you going to do about it?
I'm going to feel better about my financial position because I've got more savings."
Today you look and either get a check in the mail from the government or you look at your
portfolio and it goes up as the S&P pushes all-time highs or Zillow tells you your home
went up and you go, "Oh, look, we've got more savings because that went up.
What are you going to do about it?
I'm going to go to the Bahamas.
I'm going to buy a new car.
I'm going to do something with that money."
That's what's changed.
That's why I think that inflation is a little stickier than we've seen in prior instances.
That's why whenever I bring this up, people always say to me, "Yeah, but when the stock
market boomed from 2010 to 2020, it didn't produce inflation."
Yeah, because we weren't in a spending mentality.
Today we are in a spending mentality because if you look at the last six quarters or so
of the economy, spending has been one of the things that has really surprised everybody.
Their economists would argue, "Oh, that's the excess savings from the pandemic.
All the mailed money and everything else that we stuffed everybody's bank account full of,
they're spending that down."
That's true.
That is some of that.
But I also think that there's a comfort level about your job and your situation.
People are not afraid to strike.
We saw that with Hollywood.
We saw that with UAW.
They're not afraid to quit their jobs.
We've seen the quit rates be very high.
We've invented terms like quiet quitting if you're unhappy at your job or labor hoarding
if you're an employer and you're looking to try and not get rid of your decent employees
before you let them all go and you can always get them back, but now you can't necessarily
get them back.
People start with this attitude that, "I have this weekly paycheck.
What happens if my job goes south and my boss fires me?
Fine.
I'll find another one, so we're still going to the Bahamas."
That seems to be, I think, the attitude that's come out of 2020.
Maybe it's PTSD from the lockdown restart or something else, but there's definitely
a propensity to want to spend a little bit more and a comfort level that the employment
situation is much more favorable for employees over employers.
That's why you've been seeing all these strikes over the last six months or so.
Can I poke at that a little bit?
Sure.
Poke at it a lot.
Well, my main question is a lot of what you're talking about, to steal a word from the Fed,
is that transitory?
Is that part of the whole revenge opening up from COVID?
We were locked down and, "Hey, I find I've got more bargaining power with my employer
right now and I'm still flush from all the forbearance programs and stimulus and all
that stuff," because I can point to a lot of things right now that show that the direction
of trend looks like a lot of that, for the consumer at least, is not as strong today
as say it was a year ago.
Let me just mention a couple of things.
We've definitely been labor hoarding, no doubt there, but I think it was the stat that came
out two weeks ago or so that like 40% of businesses are saying that they, business managers saying
that they expect to do layoffs later this year.
If you look at the quits rate that's been coming down, the gains in wages that we've
seen recently, they're beginning to moderate.
It seems like the pendulum is perhaps beginning to swing back towards the employer.
It's not all the way over there yet, but it seems like we've seen peak employee bargaining
power and it's now beginning to head the other direction.
The savings rate has gone down an awful lot.
I'm sure Rosenberg talked about that in the round table you guys were on.
We've seen revolving credit spike and spike at a time where APRs are at record highs,
so people aren't happily spending on those credit cards.
They're probably spending more because they have to.
Even though we had a "good year" in the markets in 2023, on a two-year basis, the markets
are pretty flat and I just saw this updated stat the other week, which is 10% of financial
assets in the US are owned by, sorry, 93% of financial assets in the US are owned by
the top 10% of households.
Not a lot of people are looking at their statements and saying, "Oh, stocks went up this week.
I feel wealthier.
I'm going to go spend it."
Because almost all those stocks are owned by only 10% of households, who do do a lot
of spending, but still.
And then the housing market, I don't know if folks are feeling like flush about their
houses because the housing market's kind of been frozen.
Yeah, it hasn't gone down that much nationally yet, but there's definitely more worry, I
think, in the market than there was a year or two ago when prices were still jumping
double digits year over year.
So I just feel like I can point to a lot of cracks in there that say, it's just not as
confident as it was a year plus ago.
Feel free to push back.
Yeah.
So a couple of things on that, let's start with the labor market.
If you look at the data in the labor market, initial claims is still around 200,000, slightly
above it.
If you look at the last 50 years, that is usually associated with boom when you see
the claims numbers being that low.
Payrolls are still continuing to crank out about 200-ish thousand jobs a month on a three
month average.
A three month average was coming down, but bottomed in the last six months or so.
We only need, if you believe economists, about 75 to 100,000 jobs a month in order to capture
population trends and graduation trends in the economy.
So we're producing a lot more jobs than we have, and that's why the unemployment rate
is still under 4% as we sit here right now.
The quits rate is coming down, but even the current November is the last quits rate number.
It is lower than it was a year ago or 18 months ago, but it is higher than any number seen
pre-pandemic.
So we are just in a whole new realm of quits that we ever experienced before.
So I think that there is this comfort about jobs in the market.
Let me be more specific, non-professional lower end jobs is really where they're viewed
as being almost like commodities, like get this job, quit this job, go get another job.
That's where you're seeing the labor hoarding going on.
We're not labor hoarding partners at law firms, we're labor hoarding people that work the
stock at big box retailers.
That's who the labor hoarding is because once you get somebody who's been promoted a few
times and is very good at what they do and very responsible, you don't want to let them
go.
That's what the labor hoarding is because you're afraid of what you're going to get
in return where that is a very different attitude.
A couple of the other things that you mentioned on housing, yeah, the housing market is frozen,
but it's frozen in a unique kind of way.
If you look at say the Redfin data or the Zillow data, the average home price is not
really coming down that much, but sales are.
What seems to be happening is people call a broker and they say, "I want X for my house."
The broker says mortgage rates are up, so that means that monthly payments are more.
You should consider lowering your price to compensate for higher mortgages.
These people are saying, "Nope, I want X."
If nobody shows up to look at it, that's fine, but I'm standing on my price.
That's why sales are going down because we're not giving those prices.
Why aren't we giving on those prices?
I think it's because we're not feeling stressed or impatient that we have to sell, that something
has changed in my life or that there's something and I need this money.
I need to get out of this liability of this home.
Let me just poke at that for one sec.
Could be the case.
Could the other case be I'm going to be in a worse situation if I sell.
If I don't get the price I want, mortgage rates are so high, I'm going to have to buy
like a worse place with a higher mortgage.
I don't want to do that.
Yes, that could very well be the case, which gets back to the original thing.
I want my price.
I'm not forced to acquiesce to higher interest rates by lowering my price.
Now, the people that are lowering their price for that are new home builders.
Actually, new homes is a percentage of all homes sell.
I think it's at a record high or very close to record high, something like a third of
all homes sold in America now are new homes because the builders, they're in the business
of moving inventory anyway.
Got to cut that price, get this thing off the books so we could start the next project.
Those homes are moving too.
I guess what I would say about the housing market is that if you would have told us if
we were sitting here 18 months ago and said mortgage rates are going to 80%, what's housing
going to look like?
We would have said a hell of a lot worse than it actually is.
I would totally agree with it.
I also want to emphasize what I said in the beginning here.
When I say people are feeling comfortable in their spending and they're not being stressed,
there is one thing that is stressing them and that's inflation.
That is a big thing that is a big problem, but it is because the economy is showing that
trend to above trend growth that we keep spending to keep the inflation rate sticky.
Look, there's two things about inflation that can be happening at the same time.
One, there was a big transitory element of savings, of inflation, excuse me, because
of the pandemic.
That's why we went to 9%.
Yeah, that's the cost push.
That's the supply chain shortages.
Yep.
Right, right.
All right.
That happened and it's receded, but once that's receded, I think what we're finding is we'll
no longer in like a one and a half, 2% inflation world, we're in a three to 4% inflation world
once that thing has receded.
Now, why does that matter?
If I was to now turn to markets a little bit, because that's where I think it matters.
If I said to you that the inflation rate's three to 4% and the economy can still churn
out two and a half percent or so, let's just round that off and call that five to 6% nominal
growth.
The midpoint of that is five and a half.
That's what I've been advocating about where I think the interest rates are ultimately
going to go somewhere in 24, the 10 year yield goes above its 5.03% peak in October of last
year to around five and a half.
Because that 3% inflation rate, two and a half percent growth rate continues, that's
your five and a half percent nominal rate.
So I know a lot of people are more equity oriented and they're not into this macro stuff.
So 2% inflation, 3% inflation, who cares?
Well, it's the difference between say 375 and 4% on the 10 year note and say 525 to
550 on the 10 year note.
That's where it matters.
And that's where I think the concern is when I say that there's going to be this trend
growth or above trend growth and it keeps inflation sticky, it's going to keep interest
rates up there.
And that's why I've been still bearish on bonds and I know it hasn't worked since October
or November 1st, but I still believe that the 40 year bull market and bonds ended in
August of 2020.
We're in a multi-year bear market in bonds, we can talk more about that later.
There can be two or three year periods in there where you can have a big rally in bonds,
but it is because the inflation story is turned and the economy is not quite as weak, more
like the seventies where we just have a higher nominal growth, not as high as the seventies.
We're not going to have 12% nominal growth like we had in the seventies, 10 of which
was inflation, but we're just going to have a higher nominal growth than we did the previous
decade.
Okay.
So thank you.
And I do want to go more into your outlook on a multi-year bear market for bonds ahead
of us and higher interest rates, but especially given your outlook on interest rates, I want
to go back to my question of, is this sort of relative confidence that you're talking
about in the consumer, well, just in the system, I guess, is it transitory?
And where I'm going with this is there's the lag effect, right?
There'd been a lot of debate on whether the lag effect is really going to manifest here,
or if there are things that have happened this time around that have made the lag effect
less relevant.
But especially if interest rates continue to go up, even at current rates, we have this
concern about a maturity wall coming up for a lot of US corporations as the debt on the
balance sheet matures and they've got to refinance at these higher rates, right?
And that could, if it does happen, that if rates don't come down in time, that really
could injure the labor hoarding that you're talking about, right?
Where they're like, we were holding on to these people for as long as we could, but
Jesus, now that we got to rerate, we got to start bringing prices down or costs down and
we got to start chopping off limbs.
And secondly, on households, you have that as well, where I mentioned earlier the record
amounts of revolving debt that households are taking on, but also to your point about
inflation.
Even if inflation remains elevated, it's a squeeze on these households.
How long can they spend more than they were spending before and save less?
Doesn't that have a terminal date on it as well?
Yeah.
So to the first part of your question, yeah.
Could this be transitory?
Of course it could be.
And what would be, in my mind, the sign that it would be transitory?
It would be some indication that remote work is ending because that's the ultimate indication
of employee power.
I don't want to come to the office five days a week.
I'll come three, but I'm not going to come five.
So I'm going to say work from home on Mondays and Fridays.
If we could push back on that and get people back into the office five days a week, that
would be a sign that it was a little bit more transitory.
Go back and look at this past Sunday's 60 Minutes.
They did a whole segment about the evolving nature of the office market, the office tower
in big cities, converting them to residents, and about how they talk to some of the biggest
commercial real estate owners in Manhattan, and they're just acknowledging they are not
coming back.
They are not coming back five days a week.
And so companies don't need as much space, and there's 90 million square feet of vacant
offices in Manhattan, and that's not going to change, and they're trying to repurpose
these buildings to the point where they're even trying to reimagine what a city is.
And cities will reimagine themselves.
So if you saw that trend break and people started heading back to the office, but it's
been three years, and even the real estate guys are giving up on the idea that we're
going back to the office.
But if that does happen, that would be the signal.
The other thing to keep in mind too about rising interest rates, you'd mentioned a statistic
that 90 plus percent of all assets are owned by the top 10% in income.
Now a lot of those assets that they own are fixed income assets.
And so what they're doing is they're getting interest income.
And what you're finding is among the top 10, as you are finding with companies, as interest
rates have gone up, their financial position has improved.
It's getting better.
Yeah, it's a stimulus to the top of the pyramid.
Yeah.
Right.
Because they're getting more in interest income.
Warren Buffett has $120 billion of cash.
Berkshire is going to get $8 billion more of revenue this year than two years ago, simply
because his cash went from zero interest rate to 5%.
For free and no risk.
Yeah, exactly.
Right.
Microsoft is the same way.
Their positions are improving.
Now that I've said that, when interest rates go up and the markets recover, the top 10%
feel better because they're getting more interest income and they're seeing at least they've
recovered their 22 losses.
Now let's turn to the depressing part of this equation.
That number you gave me comes from the survey of consumer finances by the Federal Reserve.
They look at the liability side.
The bottom 50% of the country has 56% of the debt.
Right.
The rich people have all the assets and the poor people have all the debt.
I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
No other than Jay Powell understands this.
This was his mantra in 2022 of why we have to get inflation down.
Because these people that live paycheck to paycheck are not only seeing inflation move
up faster than their paycheck so their relative purchasing loses, it's keeping interest rates
up.
They're having to pay higher financing costs or consumer loans or credit card balances
or whatever they have and we have to get inflation down.
That was the mantra that we were saying in 2022 was the joke was be a patriot, lose money
with dignity in the stock market to kill demand so that inflation could come down.
Well, that's out the door now.
We're done with that now.
We want the Fed to cut rates.
We want everything to go up, but we haven't, I don't think, quite solved that inflation
problem and that's going to affect the bottom 50%.
That's what you see in the president's approval rating.
Why everybody's so angry and his approval rating is down and they keep citing inflation
as being the biggest reason that they're angry is because it's those bottom 50% that are
seeing it.
You and me and everybody else, we just grouse about it, but we have the ability to pay those
higher prices.
Okay.
So great point and I really want to dig into this.
First off though, I just say, I don't think it's the bottom 50%.
I think it's the bottom 80 plus percent.
When you look at the wealth distribution, it really is, you're either in the top echelon
or you're hurting with the vast majority of the rest of society.
Back of the intro, I talked about is QT ending and this past 48 hours, we've seen a lot of
buzz.
Nick Timrose, the Fed mouthpiece, and then JP Morgan issued a note very similar saying
that for all these reasons, it's highly likely that the Fed is going to implement the first
rate cut by April if not sooner.
And who knows?
We can debate that or anybody can debate that.
But my point is, your point, they haven't really put the wooden stake in the heart of
inflation and confirmed that the undead corpse is truly done.
Is this a little surprisingly premature to be pivoting to not just rate cuts, but also
ending QT this quickly?
Well, I understand why they're trying to end QT and they're getting a little bit concerned
about what's about to come.
So let me try and step us through this here real quick.
When the Fed was doing QE, quantitative easing, there was too much money in the system and
they were afraid that that was going to keep interest rates forever at zero.
So they instituted a plan to sop up that extra money, which is known as the New York Fed's
reverse repo facility.
If you've got extra money in this system, you can then go place it at the New York Fed
and they will pay you an interest rate, which is tied to the funds rate, 20 basis points
below the top end of the funds rate.
So they're currently paying you around 5.3% on that money right now.
And sorry, just to underscore for folks, the reverse repo program is a form of tightening.
Yes, it is a form of tightening because, and who does it by the way, is usually your money
market fund does it.
Like earlier this year or within the last year, something like 40% of all money market
fund assets were at the New York Fed in this reverse repo facility.
But when a money market fund takes their money and says, we're not going to buy a T-bill
or commercial paper or something, we're going to place it at the Fed and the Fed's going
to pay us an interest rate, which passes along to you and it's one of the safest instruments
in the world.
So there's nothing to be concerned about that they're doing it.
What they're doing effectively is by taking money and putting it at the Fed, you're removing
it from the financial system.
You're taking liquidity out of the financial system and you're parking it at the Fed.
That money still exists.
It just exists outside the financial system at the Fed.
The Fed's kind of separate of the financial system.
Well, as we've gotten into this period now where the Fed has stopped raising rates and
the Fed is now talking about lowering rates, money market funds are looking at ... Remember,
money market funds have to advertise on yield and they're saying, look, I give 5.3% with
the Fed every day.
It's a one day overnight loan and I just renew it every day is what I wind up doing.
But at some point, the Fed's going to start cutting rates and that number is going to
come down.
Maybe what I should do is buy a six month or nine month treasury bill that's yielding
somewhere near that, somewhere around 5.2, 5.3.
So when the Fed starts cutting rates, I still have that high rate locked in for many more
months and my average yield stays up and attracts money to my fund because that's how you do
it for money market funds, you advertise on having a higher yield than your competitors.
So money has been coming out of the New York Fed system and it's been going into longterm
treasury bills.
That means that money is reentering the financial system.
That is a form of liquidity coming back into the system and it's also allowed the Treasury
to do something else.
Back in November, when we had the quarterly refunding announcement, this is the refunding
announcement that we get from the Treasury that says how many notes in bonds and how
many bills are they going to issue in the upcoming quarter, Janet Yellen, the Treasury
Secretary, surprised us by saying we're going to issue less 10 year notes and 30 year bonds
and five year notes and we're going to issue more treasury bills.
And the bond market loved it, oh, less supply for bonds and they took off and rallied and
those rates plummeted and the bill market was fine with it because all this money was
leaving the Fed's reverse repo facility coming back into the system and was sopping up all
these extra bills.
Well, now we're at the point where almost all that money that was in the Fed's reverse
repo facility has now reentered.
There's not that much left.
There used to be 2.2 trillion in that system.
It's down to about 600 billion right now.
I don't think it has to go all the way to zero.
I think there will always be some residual in there.
But at the rate it's going, it's probably a month or two away from being out and that's
going to be a problem.
So the Treasury is going to have to look and say, look, we can't keep issuing bills at
this rate because we don't have this excess money coming in to buy them.
We might have to shift out and issue more notes and bonds, which is why the bond market
yield, the 10-year yield stopped going down around 4% over the last month.
It's had some brief interludes below 4%, but it waffles around that.
So this is the concern is that when the reverse repo facility is done, all we're going to
be left with then is the Fed doing QE, pulling liquidity out of the system, pulling liquidity
out of the system and this is the concern that the plumbing of the financial system
has.
We're going to have a liquidity problem.
The Fed understands this and it seems like even last week I thought they weren't going
to do anything about it, but it seems like they're going to start tapering the QT.
It's 95 billion a month that they reduce their balance sheet.
Maybe they go to 85, then 75, then 65 every month or some version of that on their way
to zero because they don't want to be sucking out so much liquidity.
What do we know about liquidity?
The financial system works on these overnight loans and that you can get these overnight
loans at the prevailing market rate that instead of forcing banks and brokers and hedge funds
to have to sell securities to meet obligations like more margins and performance loans for
derivatives and stuff, they could pledge these securities and get a loan at prevailing market
rates to do it, but if all of a sudden there's not enough liquidity and these loans become
much higher interest rates than market rates, that could create a lot of problems because
the plumbing of the financial system runs on a highly levered basis and if you wind
up having them to pay huge premiums, you could wind up with a lot of problems in the financial
system.
The Fed is worried about that, so they're going to try and not be as big a drain on
the financial system.
Hopefully, I explained that and this is why I think that the QT program is going to start
to probably get reduced and we're probably going to see more bills, but the last thing
I will say to you about this program, I explained it.
Maybe you still followed me on my explanation and I could tell you that the people that
are deep up to their elbows in this stuff will tell you that it is so complicated, no
one really understands it and that one of the reasons why the Fed might be willing to
back off on QT is they are afraid that if we wait, if we're not serious about this,
that some unintended consequence will come on and wreak havoc in the financial market
like the repo crisis of September 2019 when these overnight loans went to 9% and had the
potential to cause a lot of problems.
So one of the reasons why they're paving the way to do this is precisely because it is
very complicated and it is not straightforward to really understand it.
Okay, thank you for doing all that and let me just condense this for a second because
I think you've connected some dots that I think people have wanted connected for a while.
So the reverse repo program, as we mentioned a few minutes ago, is tightening.
But when you unwind the reverse repo program, as has been going on of late, that is a form
of easing or it's injecting liquidity into the system.
And so what that has done is it has really cushioned, maybe some could even argue negated
the impact of QT and a lot of the bite from the rate hikes.
So what's been interesting is we've been sold that we've been in this era of tightening,
but a lot of the things that we would have expected to see reflected in the markets and
the economy we haven't.
And it's because this flood out of the reverse repo program has been basically been offsetting
the tightening and the hiking.
So I think that's hopefully an important light bulb to turn off in people's brains.
That's exactly right.
And if you get that, you're way ahead of the game by most people.
Yes.
Okay.
And the next part is that it's almost done, we're almost out of money.
That flow of funds from the reverse repo program is almost done.
When it's done, then we really start to feel the bite of QT in full.
It's no longer being cushioned.
We feel it in full.
And you're saying, well, that could end up creating a liquidity crisis, which is something
that the Fed lays awake at night about because their job is to keep the banking system operating
and the liquidity crisis is one of the things that threatens it to seize up.
So this now goes back to December when Powell got up there and kind of surprised everybody
by being a lot more dovish than they expected.
And one of the questions that was asked at the time was, does he really believe what
he's telling us, which is, hey, we can't start cutting rates when we get to 2% because of
momentum and whatnot, we'll end up going lower than we want to on inflation.
We got to start cutting before we get there.
We think now is the time to start cutting.
It's the whole gentle landing, soft landing story, but other people were like, is that
really the case or is he worried about something that he's not telling us about?
And I think what you're saying is that might have been the case and this might have been
the thing that he was really worried about.
So what's interesting, and to your point about how complicated it is, I lie awake worrying
a lot about that, which is a lot of our systems are so complicated, I know that the people
running them know that they fully don't understand them and you do worry that if we let something
get out of control, maybe it becomes something that none of us can contain at the end of
the day.
Maybe that's his worry.
But let me ask you this.
So Powell has said for the past two years, when asked about his commitment to hire for
longer was he said, yeah, I don't really mind if I tighten too much because I've got the
tools to fix that.
If we start falling into recession or there's something going to some crisis, something
quote unquote starts breaking, I've got the monetary duct tape to come in and fix that
with programs like the BFTP and I can change interest rates on a dime and I know how to
do that stuff.
It's inflation running away from us.
That is the bigger fear of ours and I don't want to be Arthur Burns and we're going to
make sure we kill inflation.
So he all of a sudden seems to be like pivoting on that, right?
Like, well, now I'm a little bit worried about this liquidity crisis, so maybe I'll let inflation
run a little hot now, right?
Right.
And that's exactly it because you're right, December 1st, Powell said it was premature
to talk about easing and then December 14th, which was his press conference, they came
out with the new dot chart and he explained that now we're going to cut rates three times
to which everybody said, what happened between December 1st and December 14th?
And if you go back and you look at the data, nothing, nothing happened except you practically
did a 180 in two weeks off of like no data.
And so a lot of people are looking at this liquidity thing as being a potential concern.
By the way, a quick word about that and this is where I really have my criticism with the
Fed.
There's nothing wrong with having complicated systems in life that we don't fully understand,
but we do our best, but we come into it knowing that it's beyond us.
The most successful generals in the world know that when they put together a battle
plan and that only works until they meet the enemy and then it becomes a complicated, chaotic
system that they have to adapt to.
The problem I have with the Fed and some of the other monetary authorities is, oh, no,
no, we know it to the fourth decimal place and we have these knobs and levers that we
could turn and pull and we could, what inflation rate do you want?
I could just turn this knob over here and give it to your, or what liquidity level do
you want?
I'll just turn that knob over there.
We need this conceit that they know how to handle this stuff to a degree of precision
that they can't.
If they would just attack it like the generals do and say, here's my plan, but as soon as
it meets the enemy, we'll see if it still holds up and we might have to just throw it
out and go with something different, we'd be much better off because we would approach
this with a bigger respect than a conceit that we've got it all figured out and that
there's no problems here with it.
I think that as the Fed is probably trying to communicate that it doesn't have that conceit,
but at the same time, they're trying to say that they have that conceit and that's why
we're all kind of left with a head scratcher.
Why did he change and should we be concerned and stuff?
We shouldn't necessarily be concerned about this liquidity thing if we approached it in
the right fashion, but if we approach it in the fashion of that the Fed has this magic
knob, which is a QT, tapering QT, problem fixed, you could ignore it, move on.
Let's talk about AI stocks.
You could ignore this.
That's when you get into trouble.
Well, and you tell me, what's their track record of surgical precision?
Terrible.
And I would actually use another word, but we were a family show.
Okay.
Yeah.
And it's ridiculous for them to project and pretend it and it's ridiculous of any of us
to give them any credibility about it just looking at their track record.
Right.
Right.
Well, let me ask you this then.
I'm trying to remember what you said about inflation.
I know that you think there's a chance it could go higher from here.
Going back to your very beginning, I kind of got the vibe that you thought inflation
might go a bit higher here, but you're not super worried about it, but are you worried
at all that this potentially premature pivot could get inflation back to uncomfortable
levels?
Yes.
And not only that, but the whole idea that we're going to pivot, we're going to cut rates
and we're going to back off at QT and that is going to stimulate the economy is premised
on this idea that we are in the last mile to 2% on inflation and it is no longer going
to be a problem.
And as Paul said, as you pointed out, we could get started on getting rates back down and
getting rid of QT now because we're going to go to two.
Well, what if we don't?
What if we bottom out here and like I said, three to four, I'm not talking about eight
to 10 Zimbabwe levels of inflation, but three to four.
If we wind up doing that, it frustrates this whole plan that they have of trying to rein
in interest rates, rein in liquidity.
Because one of the problems is if they start backing off the QT because they're afraid
of taking liquidity out and the market concludes, wait a minute, you're just trying to foster
more inflation by doing that, it winds up backfiring on them.
It's kind of analogous to another thing that's going on.
As of Friday, the market had priced in seven rate cuts.
Now there's only eight meetings a year and the January meeting that's got like a 4% chance
they're going to cut rates.
So that must mean that every meeting this year, the market expects to cut rates in an
election year.
And people say, yes, because it's an election year.
And yes, Paul remembers all the mean tweets and he doesn't want that guy back.
So he's going to cut rates to try and help the other guy become president.
That's the cynical argument.
But I've always said, yeah, hold on a minute.
He could cut rates to help the other guy.
But if he cuts rates and we have inflation, it blows up in his face and he makes it worse.
Instead of making it worse for Biden to get reelected, not better for Biden to get reelected
by lowering rates if you do it in the face of sticky inflation.
So really it comes down to, the whole thing comes down to this inflation argument and
whether or not inflation will give them the maneuverability to be able to back off on
the QT and to cut rates as much as they would like to.
Okay.
So many questions packed into this.
One is, is the market just smoking crack here?
Is there a scenario where the Fed could cut seven times in 2024 other than, oh my God,
we've broken something, the economy is falling into a recessionary vortex and we got to get
rates down like ASAP?
I can't imagine any other scenario than that where the Fed could really justify this.
And I think if it tried to do what you just said, which is, oh, we'll just do 25 basis
points for the next seven Fed me things, inflation is going to go crazy.
Right.
Right.
Well, to answer your question, first of all, is the market, the market always smokes crack,
I guess to stick with your mountain, because if you look at the history of whatever the
market price is in, it's always wrong.
It's never, it never comes to pass.
So Deutsche Bank did this study about a month or two ago where they looked at the narrative
in the market and the pricing in the market and they announced that what we're seeing
now is the seventh pivot towards lower rates in the last two years.
The first six didn't work.
The Fed kept raising rates.
Well, maybe the seventh time is the charm, but that's the point is that the market constantly
gets this stuff wrong.
To your other point, you're right, what would cause them to cut rates aggressively?
The same thing that caused them to cut rates aggressively in 2020 and 2008, those were
election years too.
A perception that the world was falling apart either because of the lockdowns of COVID or
the financial crisis in 2008.
They were as aggressive as they ever have been in their history because they were forced
to because things were going bad in those election years.
So there is this argument, and I'm a subscriber to it, that that seven rate cuts or six rate
cuts or whatever you think is priced in is kind of an expected number.
What that means is that there's probably a 75% chance the Fed cuts three times and there's
a 25% chance the Fed cuts 10 or 12 times.
That's your bad recession and when you do an expected number of those, you come up with
six or seven.
The weighted number is six or seven, yeah.
Right.
But we're not going to get six or seven.
We're either going to get two or three or we're going to get 10.
But the midpoint is what we're looking at thinking that that's what's going to come.
So there could be some of that going on, which is why the market does a lot of that weighted
average stuff, which is why it looks wrong all the time because it might actually, if
you actually dissected it, be a little bit more right that that 70% or 60% chance did
happen.
It's just that the other 40% was in that weighted average that made it look like it was too
aggressive.
It may be, although I've not really heard that many people come on the airwaves and
say, "Oh yeah, I'm expecting 12 rate cuts this year because I think we're going to fall
into a massive crisis."
So if there's a percentage of the market that is planning for that, they're being pretty
silent about it, at least on the airwaves.
You wait until we get a bad number.
Look, we just beat on CPI.
We just beat on payrolls.
We still have 200,000 on claims.
One of those numbers comes in shockingly weak.
You'll hear that.
I guess so.
Although I want to say I have a number of the people that come, I get slammed all the
time for being bears on parade on this channel and I'm not, it's just the people I bring
on are data driven and they report how they feel given the market environment, but none
of them to my knowledge has said, "I expect 10 this year," but who knows?
We'll see.
But let me get to the other part of this, which is, all right, well, let's say it plays
out as the Fed says.
Sorry, they cut three times this year, I think, and I don't want to put words in your mouth,
but I think that still worries you from the inflation side.
Even that alone could create an Arthur Burns uptick in inflation.
It does, unless my scenario on inflation is wrong and we are really, truly on the path
to 2%, and then otherwise I do worry that you will create those animal spirits.
You will give the stock market a reason to go up.
You will give the 10% that own 90% of the assets and do the vast majority of spending
too because they're the people with the money.
Reasons to book that trip or spend that money and to push prices higher.
You've got other things out there too that are really worrisome.
Let me give you one that is just coming into focus in the last 10 days or so as we're starting
to talk, which I've been focusing a lot on and this is what's happening in the Red Sea.
I'll just sum it up real simple.
The Red Sea shipping lane is one of the most trafficked shipping lanes in the world.
About 12% of all shipping traffic goes through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean.
About 30% of containers that have all the finished goods that we get from Asia go through
the Suez Canal and the Red Sea.
And a lot of oil does too.
Yeah, and a lot of oil does.
Currently the Houthis are attacking cargo ships.
The cargo ships are being reverted around the Horn of Africa and that's adding 3,300
miles in 10 extra days to the travel.
Oil tankers were still allowed through.
They weren't attacking oil tankers, but even them, they're starting to divert around too.
We live in a just in time world is what we live in.
And the example I gave is I might be somebody that needs semiconductors from Taiwan to put
into a navigation system to send to a dashboard assembler, to send to a car manufacturer so
they could finish the car to send to the dealer who could send it to a customer.
And maybe that car's a truck and their customer needs that truck to make deliveries of his
product.
And once that daisy chain starts getting mucked up at the beginning, I don't get my chips.
I can't make my navigation systems.
You can't finish the dashboard.
They can't finish the car.
It can't get delivered.
The customer can't get it.
If he needs it for deliveries for himself, he can't make his deliveries.
The whole system becomes really messed up.
Is it as messed up as it was in 2020?
Probably not because then-
But it's echoes.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Because we also had a demand thing too.
We had the revenge spending, we were mailing people money at the same time we had that
going on.
And so that could produce goods inflation because we're starting to see the price to
ship a container go up because of the lengthening demand.
But what's basically happening is most container ships, they run like a circuit, right?
They go back and forth six times a year between Asia and say Europe.
But now that they got to go around Africa, they can only go back and forth four or five
times.
Now we need extra ships to accomplish the same thing.
And that's putting a tightness back into the market, which is why the price to ship a container
is going up.
And the reason we're paying extra prices to ship containers instead of cutting back on
production is because people want that stuff.
They're willing to spend to get that stuff.
So that's another concern that I see as far as this Red Sea thing goes.
And if you do the same thing with oil tankers, it's the same thing that happens too with
oil tankers.
They take a longer trip.
You need more oil tankers to accomplish the same thing because they take a longer trip.
The difference with oil tankers is there is an abundance of extra container ships.
There isn't much of an abundance of extra oil tankers in the world.
And we could hit it for crude.
We could hit a limit.
Or crew.
People to actually run them.
Or crew.
Yes.
Or crew.
Yes.
Then we could actually hit a limit.
We want this much crude oil.
Well, yeah, when I used to go through the Suez, I could turn my tanker around and get back
to the Persian Gulf to refill, to bring that oil back the other way.
Last thought for you.
This is a Europe problem because it's Asia to Europe.
35% of the goods that come to American East Coast ports, New York, Charleston, Savannah,
come through Europe.
So that's a third of them.
The other two thirds come through the Panama Canal and there's a low water level on the
Panama Canal and it's only running at around two thirds or three quarters of its capacity
as well too.
The supply chain is being stressed again.
I don't think it's being stressed to the extent that it was in 2020.
So we're not going to have as big a problem as we were in 2020.
But if I'm looking at sticky inflation and I'm looking at a world where the Fed is going
to do some backing off of QT and cutting rates and stimulate and telling everybody keep buying,
and now it's a little bit harder to get those products, you're going to see higher prices
across the board and you're going to see the bond market, I think, react poorly to that.
All right.
The timing isn't good as the Fed is maybe going back towards easing and these issues
are ones that are cost push inflationary that the Fed can't do anything about.
It's not a monetary issue.
No amount of stimulus is going to get more shipping containers through the Red Sea right
now.
But stimulus can keep demand so that people would say what's available and how much do
I have to pay to get it, which is paying more for the same thing, which shows up in the
CPI and the PC report is higher inflation.
Right.
Exactly.
I mean, my point is they can't.
Yeah.
So, I mean, it's coming at a bad time.
It's something the Fed can't control.
And the levers they normally pull will only potentially be inflation additionally inflationary
here.
All right.
Look, I got so many other questions we haven't gotten to.
I might do a speed round or one or two of them.
But real quick, let's get to the meat of the issue.
So given your outlook here, which basically says, if I got this right, you know, economy
looking like it's going to kind of chug along for the foreseeable future.
We got these inflation concerns you've talked about.
The cost of debt is probably going to, I think you see it going up from here, not crazy high,
but higher than probably the market expects on average right now.
I think you said 10 year back to five and a half or so.
Yep.
And with these other sort of burgeoning risks that we talked about here, you know, they
could dial up, they could dial down.
We don't know for sure.
How are you thinking that, you know, investors should be considering navigating this in 2024?
Like what basically what's your market outlook and what assets do you think are well suited
for this environment?
Which ones might not be?
So I'll start with the fixed income market and I'll make a shameless plug that this is
exactly what I'm doing with my discretionary index, the Bianco Research Total Return Index.
And there is an ETF that tracks at WTBN run by Wisdom Tree.
So what I'm explaining to you is exactly how I've got it set up.
I think that interest rates could go up.
I think one of the lines that people like to use is that, you know, the Fed raises rates
and rates go up until something breaks.
And over the last two years, I've been on with you over the last two years, was it the
25% correction in the stock market?
Was it the big sell off in the bond market?
Was it the banking crisis of last March?
All of those at one point look like, yeah, that could have been the thing that broke.
But here's we sit in January of 24 and we're like, no, that really wasn't.
So one of the arguments I'm coming with is while rates are up and it is a drag on housing,
it isn't catastrophic for housing, it is a drag on borrowers, it isn't catastrophic on
borrowers that the economy can handle these higher rates.
I think the mistake we've made is we got so used to zero between 2010 and 2020 in the
QE period that we anchored ourselves to that.
We look at these rates and we go, man, these rates look punishingly high.
And I was like, but if you compare them to pre-2009, they're not unusual rates and the
economy was just fine in the pre-2009 era.
You know, it was able to handle those level of rates.
So I think rates are going to go higher.
What does that mean for equities?
Equities is an interesting case because throughout all of 2023 until end of October, they struggled
except for the Magnificent Seven.
The end of October of 2023, the S&P was up 7% for the year.
But if you took the seven Magnificent Seven stocks out, the S&P 493 was down on the year
at the end of … It was negative around Halloween, as was mid-cap stocks, as was small cap stocks.
But the earnings numbers were okay.
The economy was okay.
We had 4.9% growth in the third quarter GDP.
That's a booming number.
What caused the stock market to struggle so much other than the seven AI stocks?
The competition of rates.
Dr. Jeremy Siegel wrote an update to his book, Stocks for the Long Run.
In it, he says, what's the long-term potential for the stock market?
It's 8%.
If you bought stocks and you did the Buffett thing, let's check where they are in 10 years.
You should reasonably expect an 8% return.
Well, 2019, if you were expecting an 8% return, your alternative was a zero in the money market
fund.
We coined the phrase T now, there was no alternative.
But in 2024, your alternative is 5.3% or 5.2% in the money market.
That's two thirds to three quarters of what you would expect for the stock market.
That's why a trillion and a half dollars went into money market funds correctly, rationally,
because it's giving you most of what the market would offer you without as much market risk.
If rates go up, yeah, you might get good earnings reports.
You might get good GDP reports.
You might get indications that the labor market's holding together, but the stock market's going
to be bothered by the competition.
I'm getting most of what you're going to give me in the stock market without the risk.
I'm fine where I'm at right now.
I don't need to extend out that much further like I did in 2019.
I didn't want to get zero, but now that I could get five and you're telling me eight
is the ... Remember, the stock market return, it has been zero over the last two years,
down 22, up 23.
I think what people are looking at is that competition for higher rates.
From my perspective, I don't think credit is going to have a problem, which is why I'd
be neutrally weighted on credit.
I think stocks are going to struggle, and I use that word carefully, struggle.
I don't think it's going to be a terrible market, but if you're expecting a levitation
of the entire index complex to go up, I don't think it can if I'm right and rates go higher.
I think structured products like mortgages and stuff like that, they suffer because of
the uncertainty and the higher volatility that we've seen in the marketplace as well
too, that they wind up suffering there.
The yield curve will probably stay roughly where it is right now.
I don't think it's going to un-invert.
I'm more speaking the 10-year, three-month curve, which is still around minus 130 basis
points, that historically, when does the curve un-invert?
When the Fed panics that the economy is going down and they cut rates like crazy and short
rates plummet through long rates.
That's usually how you un-invert the curve.
I just don't see them ready to panic just yet with the economy.
Sum it up, that's how I've got my index structured.
Those are my thoughts.
Another shameless plug, there is a website, biancoadvisors.com, that explains our index
and explains our thinking out there too as well.
That's how I would be structured for expecting higher rates, expecting it to be a struggle
because I think that the inflation rate is going to stay sticky.
Now, if I'm wrong on the inflation rate, I'm going to have to adjust all that other stuff.
Right now, I don't think I am.
Now that I look at what's happening in the Red Sea, I've got even more support for this
idea that we're going to see stickier inflation.
Okay.
When I edit this, Jim, I'll put up the link to your ticker.
I'll put up the link to biancoadvisors.com so folks know exactly where to go.
Folks, the links will be in the description too.
All right.
I took notes here.
Maybe I took them poorly because you're not that optimistic on bonds because you expect
yields to go higher.
You're not that optimistic on stocks because you expect them to struggle.
What is in the ETF right now?
Are you taking short positions or what are you long against?
I assume there's some inflation protection in there.
Maybe like T-bills because those are going to be high.
Like what's in there?
Let me back up and say that there is one benefit that the bond market has right now.
It's best summarized by my friend Jim Grant who runs the newsletter Grant's Interest Rate
Observer when he says it's nice to have an interest rate to observe again.
We had the big sell-off in the bond market and the huge total return loss is because
we had no yield.
You had no cushion.
Now you have a 4.7% cushion in the bond market.
That's the average yield of say the broad investment grade indexes around 4.7%.
That yield should cushion you to a positive total return for the year in all of the indexes.
The bond market, yeah, I think that the price could go down if you manage that price properly.
Our index is a long only index.
We're always in the market.
We're underweight certain things like duration, like shorter maturities in order to protect
ourselves from falling bond prices or higher yields.
We're underweight mortgages because of the higher volatility.
We're equal weighted in corporates relative to a benchmark.
We're just doing it relative to a benchmark because we still want to grab that 4% yield.
We want to protect that 4% yield and then maybe later this year, look for an opportunity
to get some capital gains by buying something where the price goes up to augment that 4.7%
yield as well.
We're not short or anything else and you're right.
We do have a 20% weighting in our index in short tips.
What I mean by short tips is zero to five-year maturity tips, not shorting tips.
Because they're not as sensitive to the interest rates movements, but if the inflation rate
goes up, a tip security, so everybody knows, pays you two things.
It pays you a real rate of around 1.6% and it pays you the inflation rate.
If the inflation rate stays at around three, we will get that 3% or 3.5% inflation rate
if we're right plus another 1.6% on top of that.
Plus the real rate.
That's what we are invested in right now and it's all premised on this idea about inflation.
Now, if the inflation story falls apart for whatever reason, again, I don't think it will,
we will adjust it accordingly.
The last thing I'll mention is in fixed income land, it's a little bit different from equity
land.
In equities, when you ever say, "Look, I'm structured long only to beat an index," people
correctly roll their eyes and go, "95% of managers can't beat the S&P," and that's historically
been true.
It's been very difficult to beat the S&P.
It's always at the top of the heap, which is why index funds are so popular.
But in fixed income land, if you look at some of the broad fixed income indices like the
Bloomberg aggregate or the JP Morgan broad investment grade or the ICE domestic master,
these are just the big broad S&P versions in the bond market, typically among active
managers and people that run discretionary indexes like us, that those indices fall in
about the 50th percentile, somewhere in the middle.
Being able to outperform in fixed income land is a little bit easier because the index isn't
this tower of power.
There's a lot of reasons why, but the biggest one in equities, your magnificent seven, are
your biggest winners.
They're usually overvalued stocks and you have to be in them all the way, otherwise
you fall behind the index.
In fixed income land, your all-stars in equities are your biggest weightings.
In fixed income land, your biggest weightings are your problem children, your overlevered
companies, your overlevered countries like Italy or Japan, and that they're one slip
on the banana peel away from disaster.
And you see it, you avoid it, and since they're such big weightings, you can beat the index
in fixed income land.
And that's why the index falls in the 50th percentile in fixed income land where it falls
in the 95th percentile in equity land.
So it's a very different game in the bond market than it is in the stock market.
When trying to measure yourself against an index.
All right.
Very helpful.
Very interesting too.
All right.
Well, in wrapping up here, there's so many great topics I wanted to get into with you.
So obviously we're going to have to be back on again soon.
If we can, can we just do lightning round on a couple of them?
Yes.
I'll keep it to two word or three word answers.
All right.
I feel bad because some of these require like an interview in and of themselves.
All right.
You've got some concerns about inflation.
So first let me just ask about gold.
Any thoughts on gold right now in the environment you see ahead?
Should be doing better, but it is suffering under the weight of all of the degenerate
gamblers piling into Bitcoin ETFs and avoiding gold.
That would be my short answer.
It is at an all time high.
It is at an all time high, but I think it should be doing a lot better than that.
So I've had some people of late on this program say they think that this is going to be gold's
breakout year.
Finally, right.
Starting from a very high level, lots of great sort of fundamental reasons behind it.
The dollar has been strong, maybe we'll go into a weakening phase and that this could
be the year that it really kind of cracks above longterm resistance and goes off to
the races.
What kind of probability do you give that high, low or medium?
Medium and the only reason I give it medium is look, I want to be a gold bug, but I remember
2020 and 2021.
You shut down the economy, you unemployed 14 million people, you produced 9% inflation.
You produced a giant deficit.
People were worried about the collapse of the financial system and you couldn't get
gold to go if you electrocuted it at that point.
And so I look at that with profound disappointment and go, man, if that couldn't get it to $2,500
or $3,000, maybe there are some things that can get it to go to $2,500 or $3,000 right
now.
Look, I'm not necessarily bearish on gold, but to have that spectacular breakout year,
I just don't see it.
And the last thing I'll say real quick about gold, one of the problems with gold is that
was the traditional way you get your money out of the financial system.
You're worried about the financial system.
What do you do?
You buy gold.
It's the closest thing you could do.
But what we've done over the last decade or maybe generation is we've sucked gold into
the financial system.
We put ETFs on it, futures, options, derivatives, gold miner shares.
You're shoved around.
Yeah.
Right.
So what gold becomes is another fiat currency.
So if you think that gold is going to really break out and go, that means the dollar's
going to go down.
You accomplish the same thing by buying the euro or the yen because they're going to go
up for the same reason that gold is going to go up because the dollar is going down.
That's the problem is that it's kind of become part of the system.
When it's a lure used to be, it wasn't part of the system.
Bitcoin's got the same problem with the ETF.
They're going down that same road.
That's where I'm going.
Just real quick though, just to underscore, gold was the anti-financial solution and you're
saying it's become much more financialized, right?
Right.
Exactly.
It's become part of the problem, not part of the solution.
Okay.
So Spot Bitcoin ETF just got approved.
How material an event is that?
What implications, if any, do you expect that to have for the Bitcoin and crypto world in
general?
Very material.
It was one of the more hyped ETFs that we've ever seen.
So much so that they started a fee cutting war on these ETFs before they even started
trading.
I mean, that's how hyped it was.
Some of these ETFs got down to a zero fee.
Longer term, I think that this is the textbook definition of buy the news and sell the rumor.
So it's going to struggle from here.
Longer term, what I fear is the same thing with gold.
What did I like about ... I'm a bull on cryptocurrencies long-term.
Why?
Because I think that they're building an alternative financial system.
It's not there, but they're working on it.
And I've got hope and promise that they're going to find a better alternative financial
system, especially for people in Latin America, Asia, and Africa that have lousy financial
systems, have terrible currencies, have no way to store their net worth.
Or unbanked.
Yeah.
Or unbanked.
That's the word I was looking for as well.
But what I'm afraid of with the ETF is by roping you into the system, all of a sudden
all that innovation and all that push to try and create an alternative financial position
is just going to go by the wayside and everybody's going to want to just put their money in red
or black and just speculate on whether number go up or number go down and lose the plot
of what they're trying to do.
I hope I'm wrong on that, but I just see them so mesmerized by this ETF and it's just consuming
all of their energy.
I'm like, "Aren't you guys supposed to be building the next financial system instead
of just doing your technical analysis, speculating on when Bitcoin's going to get to 60,000 or
not get to 60,000?"
Like I said, we're losing the plot.
That's what I fear and I hope I'm wrong on that, but right now I think that we're probably
going to have a sell the news type of period and then some indigestion, and then we'll
see if my fears are overstated and that they actually are getting back to developing that
new financial system of which Bitcoin would be the cornerstone of it.
And then I could go back to being that long-term bull again.
All right.
I'm going to ask a very naive question about this.
Do these ETFs, do they own underlying Bitcoin and is it just all the net asset value of
Bitcoin holdings or is this like paper Bitcoin, where just like GLD has a lot of gold futures
in there, so it's not fully allocated to ounces of gold?
So there was a series in 2017 of Bitcoin futures that the ETFs own the futures contracts that
trade on the CME on Bitcoin.
And so that's a Bitto is the big one there.
That's a separate product.
This one, they own the actual coins themselves.
One of the reasons why Coinbase's stock has gone ballistic is they're going to make a
ton of money being the custodian for half of these Bitcoin ETFs.
Somebody's got to buy these Bitcoins and somebody's got to store them in an electronic wallet
in a safe way.
And Coinbase is very well suited for that.
And that's why their stock was up like 300% last year.
Okay.
So new capital going into these ETFs means that end of the day, somebody's buying additional
Bitcoin.
Right.
Exactly.
Okay.
All right.
Again, we could have an interview on every one of these things.
All right.
I'm wrapping it up here.
I just want to flag because you're a great guy to have these conversations with and I
really value your macro outlook on many things other than just the economy.
And we've had many private discussions, including a pretty lengthy one right before we turn
the camera here on some of these issues.
So I really hope at some point to get you back and talk about things like you're there
in Chicago, where I think that's where the Democratic Convention is going to be this
year.
So we're in a presidential election cycle.
As much as this isn't a political channel, we're aware that there are implications to
what goes on in politics.
So we'd love to get your thoughts on how the presidential race may impact macro and markets
this year.
A big thing I want to talk about with you is you and I are very, I think, both very
conscious of the wealth gap that's in this country that has been accelerating and the
trajectory does not seem to be getting any better.
In fact, it continues to seem like we're increasingly bifurcating and just sort of socially, what
are the long term implications of that?
Is there any optimism that we can avoid getting to a breaking point socially?
We're just so many of those people.
Like I said, it's a story of the 80%, really probably like 90% versus everybody else.
How worried are you about that trajectory and what might emerge from it?
We were talking earlier about immigration.
In fact, our broken/non-existent immigration policy right now and just a lot of the sort
of economic and social challenges that that creates.
So hopefully at some point, Jim, we can get you back on and really delve into those.
So just two real quick things.
I am an optimist about the country because I believe what Winston Churchill said about
Americans holds true that America could be counted on to do the right thing after it's
exhausted all other options.
And we seem to be in the process of trying to exhaust all of the other options and then
all we'll be left with is do the right thing.
But right now we're in the bad part of that.
And the second one about the provocative thing is, I'll just throw this out for people just
to kind of ponder.
The Democrat convention is in Chicago this year, in July.
The governor of Illinois, J.B.
Pescuir, was on some of the Sunday morning talk shows begging, begging was his word,
the governor of Texas to stop the immigrant flow buses that are dropping off immigrants
in Chicago and all the other northern cities, but especially Chicago because it's below
zero and all this other stuff.
There is a story out there that those buses aren't going to stop coming to Chicago because
they want to make sure that there is as many homeless immigrants as possible on the streets
of Chicago for the convention this summer.
And so we'll have to see if that's indeed what seems to be happening.
But here we are in January and I hear the governor of Illinois begging the governor
of Texas to stop the buses and the governor of Texas has a very good answer.
You know, the governor of Illinois said, why don't you give us thirty six hours notice?
And his answer was, as soon as I get thirty six hours notice that they're going to walk
over the border into Texas, I'll give you thirty six hours notice as well.
So you want to be a sanctuary state?
This is part of being a sanctuary state.
This is a big issue.
And the last thing I'll say real, real fast.
The night before we're recording was the Iowa caucus in the polls of people going into the
caucuses among Republicans far and away.
The number one issue in the country is immigration.
That is number one by a long way.
Number two is a distant second to it.
So this is going to be a big, big issue as we go through twenty, twenty four.
All right.
And it's one that I do want to talk more about on this channel.
It is a sensitive issue.
I think it's hard to do without inflaming emotions kind of on all sides.
But it is a real issue and it's one that we're going to just need to be able to have an adult
discussion around.
So folks watching, don't be surprised if I begin to bring in some people or ask the opinions
of folks like like Jim, because it's not going to go away by not talking about it.
And and it's it's already, as Jim said, it's I guess at least for Republican voters, number
one issue for them.
So it's something that's going to impact the future of the governance of this country.
So anyways.
All right, Jim.
Well, look, a couple of wrap up questions.
First one, where can folks follow you and your work?
They've enjoyed this discussion.
They want more.
Jim Bianco, where should they go?
Research site is Bianco Research dot com.
ETF site is Bianco Advisors dot com.
I'm active on Twitter and LinkedIn and YouTube.
You can find me at Bianco Research on Twitter at Bianco Research on YouTube and under my
name, Jim Bianco on LinkedIn.
Quick word about about Twitter, like probably you too, Adam.
I got a lot of scam accounts that use my name and likeness.
So make sure you find the one with the blue checkmark and three hundred and seventy thousand
followers.
I only say that so you get to the right one.
If you're following me and it's got if you follow me and it's got thirty eight followers,
you're not following me.
All right.
I'll put the handle on the screen.
So folks know the right one.
I'll also put the links in the description so folks can one click their way there if
they want to.
And just a reminder, both for Jim and me, if you ever get contacted by Jim or me over
social media and we're soliciting something from you, it is definitely not us.
That is definitely a scammer, right?
I'm never going to DM you and tell you to send me money.
I'll tell you in a public way about my ETF, but I'm not going to tell you to send me money.
Put your hand out there publicly about the ETF.
Got it.
All right.
So I'm getting to the very last question to you, Jim, which is going to be, look, we've
just spent the hour talking all about money.
What's one non money related investment you would encourage folks to adopt in their lives?
All right.
Well, just in wrapping up here, the Thoughtful Money Conference date has been written in
stone now.
That's going to be Saturday, March 16th.
More details on how to register for that, get the early bird price and all that stuff
coming up.
Get tuned, hopefully should have that for you in less than a week.
Reminder that if you are a premium subscriber to my sub stack, adamtagert.substack.com,
not only do you get a bunch of content for free during the week about everything that's
going on here at Thoughtful Money, but amongst the other benefits, your premium subscription
will serve as a discount card to the conference.
So no matter what discounts we're offering as we get up to the final full price for the
conference, you'll get an even lower price because you'll get an additional discount
tacked on by being a premium sub stack subscriber.
All right.
And if you have enjoyed this conversation with Jim, even half as much as I have, and
it's been amazing as usual, Jim, and would like Jim to come back on and hopefully tackle
some of those other big issues I talked about, please let them know by hitting the like button,
then clicking on the red subscribe button below, as well as that little bell icon right
next to it.
All right, Jim, we're at you for the last question here.
What's a non monetary investment you would encourage people to consider adopting?
Better health.
And I would say, look, find something you like to do physically.
Dance, run, hike, jog, bike, ski, golf, tennis, fill in the blank, and don't be afraid to
spend some money to do it.
Because if you get yourself in better health, that is probably going to be the best returns
you will ever find in any investment you have.
Great point.
Something, a drum I beat on this channel a lot.
And I love that about your point about don't be afraid to spend money because the ROI is
really about the best you'll find.
And you'll really notice that return the older you get when you're looking around at your
peers who didn't invest in themselves and say, oh my God, I'm so glad I took this seriously.
But what I find too is a lot of people will oftentimes have the intent, like, yeah, I'm
ready to do this, but they don't necessarily have the experience base or knowledge base.
And so they just try a couple of things.
And then after a while, the initial motivation peters out and you're right back to where
you were.
Whereas if you hire a good coach or you go to a gym with a good coach or you hire a nutritionist
to help actually put together a real plan for you, that stuff becomes a lot more sustainable
long term.
And those people can really get you over that early failure hump that so many people fall
into.
And also do something you want to do, you know, sometimes what happens with people is
they take up, oh, I'll take up running, you know, because that seems like a good way to
get into shape without spending much time.
And then you just find out it's just not for you and that's fine.
There's a bunch of other things you can do besides that.
And you find whatever it is, you know, like I said, maybe it's dancing or anything that
you just get out and move.
And once you find something you like and you want to do, it's not that hard to do it.
Great point.
Yeah.
Do what you like.
Do what works for you.
All right.
Well, look, thanks so much, Jim.
It's been wonderful.
Good luck on the ETF.
Love to have you back in the program again soon.
Like I said, folks, if you've still got some stamina left, I talked with Andy Konstan.
That was the video right before this one.
And if you really want to understand like the mechanics of how the reverse repo program
works or the BFTP, the bank funding term program that the Fed put in place to stem the banking
crisis last year that is now coming up for expiry and there's a lot of debate whether
that's going to be a big thing or a nothing burger.
Andy goes deep into that.
So again, if you've got some stamina, I'll put up a link to that video right here.
Thanks so much, Jim.
