Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
Nothing happens in economy without energy,
and despite the current efforts and hopes
to decarbonize our energy systems,
the world remains heavily dependent on oil,
especially as the dominant transport fuel
in moving goods from point A to point B.
Oils had a rocky ride the past several years,
with its price ranging from a high of $120 a barrel
to briefly negative prices
at the height of the pandemic chaos.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine
disrupted the global trade of oil,
and so, to a lesser extent, so far at least,
has the resurgence of war in the Middle East.
What does 2024 look to have in store for this essential fuel?
Well, for answers, we're fortunate to speak today
with the energy experts at Doomburg.
The exceptional quality of their newsletter
has made them the number one ranked financial substack
in the world, and for good reason.
Doomburg, thanks so much for joining us today.
- Adam, real pleasure to be here.
Happy New Year.
Congratulations on your recent move to substack.
As you know, we're huge fans of your work.
We were thrilled when you decided to shift platforms,
and we are amazed, frankly, at the magnitude
of your early success and couldn't be more proud
to count you now as a peer on substack
and also as a friend.
Gotten to know you quite well
and in our personal lives over the months,
and much like Grant Williams,
you're as nice and authentic in real life
as you appear on the screen,
and it couldn't be happier for this
to be our debut podcast appearance in 2024.
- Thanks so much.
The friendship, the most important part on that list there.
Doomburg, I'm just trying to follow in your footprints,
or should I say your chicken footprints there on substack,
and I just am amazed
what you've been able to accomplish there.
I consider my accomplishments there so far
just a small fraction of the success
that you folks have had there,
but like I said, incredibly well-deserved,
but I look forward to continuing to explore that platform
under your guidance.
You've been a great mentor to me on that,
and more importantly, really look forward
to digging into your thoughts today on the oil market
and educating our viewers about what's happening
with this essential fuel.
So a lot of questions for you.
You've written some really great thought-provoking
recent pieces on oil.
Very quickly, though, if we could start
kind of at the highest level here
and just get a sense of your current assessment
of the global oil market right now.
- You bet.
So as we have long articulated in our pieces,
as macro analysts, our view is that
the most important question you should answer
before doing anything else is to ponder
whether the world is currently in a period
of relative energy excess or shortage.
And, you know, Doomburg was born
and rose to some prominence
during a period of energy shortage,
and so as a consequence of that,
I suppose many of our subscribers might view us
as sort of perma-energy bulls
because we've really only ever written
during a period of energy shortage.
Well, that has changed.
And some of our pieces in the past few weeks
have acknowledged that change,
and it is our view, because we have to be,
you know, agnostic observers of the market
if we're going to be useful to our subscribers.
It is our view that the world,
beginning with the near-miss
in the winter of 2022, 2023 in Europe,
has now shifted to a period
where I think it's pretty undeniable
that we're at the global level
integrated across markets.
We are experiencing
a period of relative energy abundance.
Now, that's unabashedly a good thing
for humanity, for the economy,
for human progress.
But if you're an energy investor,
that's something that I think you need to consider
as you ponder your next moves.
And going into 2024, you know,
we have written a few pieces
about the glut of natural gas,
which is very obvious,
but also how that bleeds
into other primary energy sectors,
including coal and oil.
And then most recently,
as I'm sure we'll get into,
we put out a piece called
"Peach, Cheap Oil is a Myth,"
which was pretty controversial,
provoked a lot of interesting response,
but we stand by that piece
and happy to discuss the key components of it.
And then most recently,
we talked about the enormous potential
of the Western Hemisphere.
And you mentioned that the ongoing,
you know, hot war in the Middle East
is potentially putting a floor
under oil prices today.
There's so much potential around the world
that, you know,
there's really an enormous amount of oil.
And for reasons we can get into,
we think that the...
We would be more cognizant of the headwinds
than the tailwinds with the giant caveat
that we're always one geopolitical disaster
away from a massive spike
in the price of highly inelastic commodities
like oil.
But all things being equal,
we enter 2024
during a period of relative supply abundance,
and that needs to be considered
as we ponder, for example,
the question as to why it is
that the U.S. has not yet fallen into a recession.
And we could talk about why we believe
energy might at least explain part of that answer.
So happy to take this answer
in any of the directions that you want to go.
Okay.
I want to get to your 2024 outlook
for both supply and price.
So whichever path takes us to your answers
on those key questions.
But let me start by asking,
what are the main reasons, you think,
for why we transitioned
over the past couple of years
from a period of shortage
to now a period of relative excess,
especially when we consider
some of the factors I mentioned there,
like the disruption to global oil trade
caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine
and then the West's reaction to that.
It would be a little counterintuitive.
I think back then, everybody was really thinking
oil was going to continue to get tighter and tighter
in that type of world,
but the opposite seems to have happened.
Why?
So we opened one of our pieces in mid-December,
which is titled "Liquefied Natural Glut,"
with a great quote from Nassim Taleb,
who actually posted this as a tweet
back when there were such things.
And the quote is,
"I've seen gluts not followed by shortages,
but I've never seen a shortage
not followed by a glut."
And that's pretty wise, you know,
for as controversial as a character as he is.
He's a deeply intelligent human being, obviously,
and we pay careful attention
to the things he says and the things he writes.
We saw extreme shortages in 2022,
especially in the natural gas market,
and it is just unsurprising that,
as we said in that piece,
people in the industry are notorious
for drawing tangent lines to sine waves.
You know, they think upward-trajecting prices
will continue forever,
and the same happens near the troughs.
And this is why, you know,
if you were to envision the price of commodities,
they are an upward-sloping sine wave
with pretty cyclical peaks and troughs along the way.
And coming out of that crisis,
especially with the blessing of the warm winter,
many of the investments that were made
during a period of emergency are now coming online.
These are tens of billions of dollars
worth of infrastructure that, once they come online,
they never go offline,
and they all tend to come online around the same time.
So that's for natural gas.
But what does this mean for oil?
So in our piece, for example,
peak cheap oil is a myth.
We mentioned three main reasons
why people are always incorrect
about the fact that peak cheap oil
might be here or behind us,
or we're in a period of chronic shortages.
The first is, and this is in large part
because of our fascination with, you know,
the Magnificent Seven or the Googles
and the Facebooks and the Microsoft,
people radically underestimate the sheer technical brilliance
and the horsepower embedded in the fossil fuel industry.
The disinflationary impact of technology--
the deflationary impact of technology is profound.
Every day, scores of thousands of the world's smartest,
most brilliant scientists and engineers and technicians
and, you know, field workers set about the task
of doing the dizzying array of work
that makes modern life possible.
They compete on price
against some of the most ruthlessly efficient firms
in the world.
They are the ultimate price takers,
so they can only improve their profitability
by improving their efficiency and reducing their costs,
and they do, and they're magic about it.
It would blow your mind
if you ever went to the control room of Saudi Aramco,
which I had the privilege of doing
back when I was in industry.
We tend to think of these old commodity companies
as slow-moving dinosaurs of yesteryear,
when in reality, you know,
China has a university dedicated
to producing petroleum engineers
that has a student body of over 15,000.
You know, the U.S. produced 600 of them last year.
There is an enormous amount of technology in this space,
and our guess is that it's probably compounding
at about, like, 8% to 10% a year in efficiency gains
just from technology alone, so that's one.
Second, many of the constraints to release a new supply
are artificial and political.
They're not inherent. They're not geological.
And as oil prices increase,
the political pressure to open the aperture
necessarily increases, and we see governments change.
They become more right-wing or reactionary
or policies are loosened.
In fact, for all of Biden's happy talk on the environment,
the U.S. has never produced more hydrocarbons
than it has in the past year, and we could talk about that,
because the third thing, which in many ways
was the most surprising to our subscribers
and the one that I'd love to dive in deeper with you on,
is people have too narrow a definition of what oil is.
The definition of oil is ever-changing,
and we have a pretty unique definition of what oil is,
and once you widen that definition,
which isn't necessarily always captured
in the official "oil production statistics,"
you then can see that we have a tsunami
of hydrocarbons coming online, especially in the U.S.,
and that is a significant headwind to prices.
Now, again, we are not short-term traders.
I can't tell you what oil will be next week or next month,
but all things considered, to the opening question
I said that one must always ponder as analysts,
are we currently in a situation of relative access or abundance?
And I think it's undeniable
that we're in a situation of abundance,
especially if you widen your definition
of what oil actually is.
Okay, so we're going to basically combine
a couple of topics here and now.
So, in your response to my earlier question
about what's really driven this move into a glut,
I don't know if that's too extreme of a word,
but at least a period of excess,
sounds like you're saying markets have responded, right?
Oil was getting really pricey, supply was getting a little tight,
and the producers around the world have responded
to the point now where they've met the market need,
and now a lot of those investments,
because they take time to come online or continuing to come online,
and there's now a tsunami, to use your word,
at least in the U.S., coming online here at this point in time.
There's a tailwind to all of that,
which are the three elements that you just mentioned here,
which is technology continues to compound in terms of efficiency,
there are political issues that can be changed much more rapidly
than geological ones, and then there's this maybe mismatch
in terms of how people actually look at what oil is,
and you guys have your own definition that we'll talk about here in just
a second.
But let me wrap this in the larger point you made,
because I want to make sure it's not lost on the viewers,
where you're saying that peak cheap oil is a myth.
There's a lot of people out there that have had the understanding,
I'll say, that the return on oil,
the energy invested per energy returned on oil has been decreasing over time.
There was a famous book written by Matt Simmons
at the beginning of this millennium called Twilight in the Desert,
has influenced a lot of people.
I'll be super transparent,
influenced me and the work of a business partner
that I was engaged with for many years.
We wrote a lot about net energy return.
And I think there's a lot of people that are probably watching this video
right here,
Doonberg, that are still pretty steeped in that worldview.
So, you are challenging those views,
and I think you're doing it based on the data that you're seeing here.
But I just want to make it clear for folks.
Is what you see, this peak cheap oil,
is that a period at which you think,
"Hey, we're in a period right now with a lot that's adding a tailwind to oil,
but eventually all those issues that Matt Simmons and others have raised
are going to catch up with us."
Or do you truly think it's a myth
that this is something that will continue higher and to the right
in terms of production for the rest of our lifetimes?
So, again, it all comes down to timeframe.
So, let me just state specifically what we mean when we say cheap oil is
a myth.
Fifty years from now we'll be producing far more oil than we're producing
today,
and it will be affordable.
There will be extended periods in the next 50 years
where we have a chronic shortage and oil spikes,
and there will be an extended period in the next 50 years
where we have an abundance and oil is cheap.
Now, there's one really important point that we made in the piece
that I think would really resonate with your viewers,
which is when you talk about the price of oil as measured in U.S. dollars,
you're measuring two things.
You're measuring the value of oil
and you're measuring the value of the U.S. dollar.
Our preferred approach is to plot oil in ounces of gold.
And when you look at the 40-year chart of oil in ounces of gold,
which we put in this piece,
there's nothing in that piece that signifies return on energy invested,
crisis.
Again, whenever you look at historical figures to try to protect forward
in the industry,
a fallacy that many observe...
Look, that could be right. I'm just giving you our view.
A fallacy that many market observers do is they'll look at something like...
Yeah, this is the chart. Perfect.
They'll look at something like rig count or capital invested,
but the backwards version of that data does not include all the new version
of technology
that is put behind those investments or those rigs.
Rigs are getting far more efficient. Capital is getting far more efficient.
That's what happens when oil prices go negative
and people are forced to figure out how to make more with less.
The forward-looking analyses that rely on backwards-looking data
that does not fully incorporate the technical and political changes that
we talked about
is the basis of that, we believe, mistaken belief.
Now, that doesn't mean that you can't look at data from 18 months ago
and project for the next six months if you're in the business of doing
short-term trading.
We're not making that call.
Fifty years from now, I would say if you ask me to take the over-under
on a million barrels of oil per day and set the over-under
at 140 million versus roughly 102 today, I'd take the over.
We grow at 2% a year forever, and we will.
Okay, so from your perspective,
oil's future, at least measured in the rest of our lifetimes,
is that line up and to the right, that sine wave traveling up and to the right
where it'll have its peaks, it'll have its valleys,
but over time, it will be marching higher in terms of production.
And look, oil could get very expensive in US dollars.
That doesn't mean that oil is expensive except for Americans, right?
And that's one of the reasons why we're deeply long gold.
I just think that when you measure the price of oil in US dollars,
you also have to take into account the fiscal situation
and the monetary policies of the country
and whether alternative currencies eventually evolve
and all of those complexities.
And if you take the 5,000-year currency of gold
and you measure BTUs per ounces of gold, it's shockingly stable and cheap.
It's as cheap as it's ever been in the past 40 years.
Even correcting for the jump that we had last year,
now some would say that's because gold is appreciated.
Well, in our worldview, that just means the dollar has depreciated.
Got it, got it.
Let me ask this one question,
then we'll dig a little bit more deeply into your definition of oil.
So, in the olden days, when we first discovered oil,
it was very easy energetically to get that oil out of the ground, right?
Put a relatively shallow straw in the ground, you know,
you get a gusher at a place like Spindletop, right?
We all remember the Deepwater Horizon crisis.
I remember, to your point about technology,
hearing that that oil rig at the Deepwater Horizon site
had more technology on it than the Space Shuttle had had,
talking to the complexity of the technology.
But, you know, it's a lot harder to get oil out of the ground,
you know, going a mile under the water
and then further than that underground, trying to bring it back up.
It's got a lot more complexity,
takes a lot more energy to do that.
And that's where you get into the energy return on energy invested.
You know, there's a general argument that we, as humans,
we went after the easy stuff first,
because that required the least amount of energy to do.
And then over time, you know,
we're having to do more and more complex things
that, yes, might still take as much oil out of the ground,
but the energy that's being invested to get it out is increasing.
Does that factor into your calculations at all?
And is that a real concern, a false concern?
So let me ask you a question, because our friend Nate Hagens,
who is a brilliant energy analyst with whom we often disagree,
but we do so politely and he's a great thinker and a great person
that we've had constructive debates with.
He made a fascinating point in one of his YouTube videos.
I'll send it to you afterwards and you can include it in the link if I can
find it.
Let's do the following scenario.
Let's say we produce 100 BTUs in the Permian.
And it costs us 20 BTUs to do that,
which would be low on energy return on energy invested.
That would be pretty expensive energy, according to the pessimists in
the world.
But what if that 20 was co-produced in the Permian on site?
And so to Adam, the buyer of that 100 BTUs,
who cares where that 20 BTUs came from, because it didn't come from the
existing grid.
And so the pessimists would say the energy return on energy invested is
five to one.
You invested 20 BTUs and you produced 100. To Adam and to Doomba,
the energy return on energy invested is infinite.
So it's the same argument that, not argument, same discussion I had with
Mike Green
when I appeared on his show,
we talked about LNG is a very poor energy return on energy invested material,
but not to the Europeans who buy it. All the energy that went into producing
it doesn't matter
when the carrier shows up and offloads its enormous amounts of BTUs into
the European grid.
And if all of the excess energy in the US is used to convert the energy
that is then sold into a product that is more usable,
well, where do you count that penalty? There's so much energy in the US
right now.
It's amazing. And I think this is where once we talk about the changing
definition of oil and why that has happened,
it'll become more clear. But there is a bit of a fallacy.
So if I have to spend 40 BTUs that are already there that are going to be
wasted anyway in the Permian,
because we have so much trapped energy there,
then what is the energy return on the 100 BTUs that get out to the people
that buy it?
It's infinite. There's an enormous amount of energy.
People have, like the natural gas shortage is what's really killing oil
because we produce way more natural gas as a response,
which comes with all these other products that are actually oil as soon as
refiners can figure out how to use them,
which is I'm sure we'll talk about next. Okay. Well, let's actually now
segue into that.
So give people a little bit of a background in terms of the different types
of oil that are out there
because I think there are way more types of oil out there than people assume.
So let's take a step back. We have a video that we're pondering putting
together
and releasing to our subscribers called What is Oil? A Doomburg Primer,
which is not something we would typically do,
but I'll give you a free preview of if we ever do that, what that video
would say.
So the first thing you have to understand, or the two questions that you
have to understand,
when pondering the definition of oil is who buys physical oil and what do
they do with it?
So let's tackle them in sequence. Who buys physical oil?
Well, some traders buy physical oil so they can, you know, play in the
markets.
And there's a small number of power producers that buy physical oil so they
can burn it and make electricity.
But the vast majority of physical oil is bought by refiners.
Now, what do refiners do? They take hydrocarbons and they make gasoline,
diesel, jet fuel, chemical precursors, asphalt, lubricants.
We're all familiar with all those products. Well, as it turns out,
the specifications of what comes out of a refinery are very tightly
controlled.
We want to know what we're putting into our jet engine and to make sure it
doesn't gunk it up
or that it works as we think it is and gives us the mileage that we
anticipate.
You would never put gasoline on a diesel truck because it'll gunk up
the engine.
You would never put diesel in a gasoline truck. So the specifications of
the products are fixed,
but the specifications of the input are highly variable and they depend on
the flexibility of the refiner.
So here's what typically happens. A certain form of oil, quote unquote,
a mixture of hydrocarbons is suddenly widely available because of some
technological development in the field.
And during the early days, because most refiners can't handle that oil,
it's cheap.
Can't give it away. However,
somebody via game theory in the refining world will make the investments
necessary to take full advantage of those hydrocarbons
and convert them into the final products.
And then once a few do, the others will because the technology is proven.
And then suddenly that new source of hydrocarbon becomes oil because it
finds its way into a refinery.
So our definition of oil is a very simple one. Any hydrocarbon that finds
its way into a refinery is oil.
And when you have that as your lens, then you just take a step back and
say what hydrocarbons are finding their way into refineries.
And the example that we talked about in the piece, which is really surprising
to us when we did the research, is natural gas liquids,
which is a series of ultralight hydrocarbons that is co-produced in a lot of
the production of natural gas that was suddenly available in very wide supply.
And refiners have adapted and have shifted the inputs into the refineries
to make take advantage of this very cheap source of hydrocarbons.
But they still make gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, chemical inputs, lubricants,
asphalt, et cetera.
So they are adapting. And the more flexible a refinery gets, the wider the
definition of oil becomes.
And so just let me put some numbers on it. In the Permian Basin today, which
everybody acknowledges is the source of incremental growth for the world.
You get an awful lot of associated natural gas, which is why we have this
natural gas glut, really.
We are producing so much natural gas so quickly in the Permian that we
cannot build LNG export terminals fast enough to deal with it,
which is why natural gas in the US is two bucks a million BTU and why LNG
prices have collapsed in the rest of the world.
And sorry to interrupt, but just to help people understand, is the reason
for that is because we are pursuing the oil,
the shale oil that's there in the Permian and the natural gas is a byproduct
of all that oil drilling.
Correct. And worse than that, saturated in that natural gas are natural
gas liquids,
which the industry has quite under the radar spent tens of billions of
dollars on infrastructure to make use of that material.
So NGLs alone, if we just took US natural gas liquids production.
Today from basically almost nothing 10 years ago, we would be the second
largest member of OPEC.
We produce six million barrels a day of natural gas liquids, which are not
counted in everyone's definition of oil.
So when you see like 13 million barrels a day record production of the US,
that extra six million is not counted, but it finds its way to refine.
All right. So let me just understand this. So natural gas is coming out. It's
got natural gas and it's got natural gas liquids in it.
So this is different from liquefied natural gas, which we expend energy to
compress and ship.
So these are these are associated liquids along with natural gas.
And you're saying is, is there almost oil inputs that we've been getting
for free because it's been sort of waste?
We just didn't know and we haven't known what to do with it until relatively
recently.
The industry has said there's so much of this stuff. We're going to figure
out how to turn it into a usable form of oil.
That's correct. And so if you look at the for example, if you look at the
Sankey diagram, I'm going to pull it up here now.
I'll share it with you. It's going to take me a minute to figure out how
to do this.
This is U.S. natural gas liquids production, which is different than
liquefied natural gas and is different from oil.
It's light hydrocarbons on the on the spectrum between natural gas and
heavy crude.
This is in between. Right. And so you can see here as a result of the
shale revolution,
we've gone from basically two million barrels a day to over seven million
barrels a day in the latest numbers that I saw.
And this is all finding its way into a refinery. And so if you go to this
chart, this is all the infrastructure just in,
you know, the U.S. Gulf Coast area that has been invested in the past decade.
Really great website, RBN Energy. I want to give them a plug.
This is where we got this data, a really great energy blog.
If you're interested in energy and particularly U.S. energy and particularly
U.S. hydrocarbons, they're an invaluable resource.
And then if you look at the Sankey diagram of the flow of molecules into
and out of the U.S. Refinery network, this has exploded.
So you have crude production and crude imports and crude exports and then
NGLs going in, but you still have the products that you recognize coming up.
So in our view, NGLs are oil. And this massive amount of growth is discounted
by the market today.
Well, sorry to interrupt, but just make sure I heard you correctly.
If we just looked at the NGLs as the natural gas liquids on its own,
you're saying that would be the equivalent to the second largest contributor
to OPEC right now?
Yes. Wow. It's huge. And this has been happening under the radar because
of the explosion in investments in the Permian Basin.
As we're chasing oil, we're getting oil, light, light grades of oil that
refiners don't necessarily like to use.
But they're adapting, which is why we export a bunch of it and we still
import a bunch of crude.
But we're also getting natural gas, which is why we have this explosion in
LNG export terminals coming out of the U.S.
But it's not going as fast as the production is rising.
And then you get these NGLs, which are hydrocarbons that industry has
invested in the infrastructure to take advantage of.
So it is our view that over time this material needs to be considered oil.
It goes into a refinery and out comes the products. And so if there's more
of this, there's less of a need for that.
Right. And if there's less of a need for that, that's a headwind.
That makes total sense. In fact, there's probably even less of a need for
the crude imports.
And if you could just talk for one moment, why do we import still a material
amount when we have such great production going on here right now and export?
This gets back to, you know, our refineries are running so tight. So first
of all, the U.S. has more refining capacity than it needs.
And so this is actually exports of refined products, which we should have
highlighted.
We also export a lot of crude and we export a lot of gasoline and diesel,
although it's fascinating because we still have to import it because we
don't have the ability to serve ourselves,
which is a topic of ours that we're researching, like the U.S. Northeast
has no refining and we don't have any pipelines to the refiners in the south.
And because of the Jones Act, we can't supply them with product we make
domestically.
And so they're forced, for example, to import diesel that is refined in
India using Russian crude.
OK, so that's a good example of what you were saying earlier about a
political reality that could change very quickly if we decided to.
So we export crude because our refineries were built to be optimized for
the processing of heavy crude from Canada and Venezuela and what we used
to produce from traditional sources.
The grades that are produced, these are all, of course, generalizations,
but the grades that are produced in the Permian, for example, are very light.
And so if you've invested an enormous amount of money to be able to take
sulfur out of heavy crude and heavy crude is much cheaper than light
sweet crude,
you want to go and import that heavy crude and let the producers export the
light sweet crude to the refiners that don't necessarily have the capability
to handle that much sulfur.
I'm giving you just a crude example of that.
That's actually understandable. We have the capacity. It's cheap on the
open market.
Right. Why would I pay 70 for Permian when I could pay 55 for a heavy grade
of crude and refine that?
These people are operating on very thin margins. This gets back to our main
point about technology, right?
It is incredible how brilliant these companies are.
And if you give them a five dollar arbitrage between grades of oil, they
will take full advantage of that.
And this is what we see. This is the deflationary impact.
This is the deflationary impact of technology manifesting.
And so there's an enormous amount of hydrocarbons. The U.S. is sitting on
a giant pile of hydrocarbons.
We are by far the world's largest producer of natural gas that has increased
twofold in the past decade.
As a consequence of that, we're producing a sea of natural gas liquids.
We're also producing more oil, traditional oil. And taken together, once a
refinery system can take full advantage of any particular set of hydrocarbons,
it becomes oil, in our view.
Got it. So our system is becoming better and better at taking hydrocarbons
and making oil out of it.
So it totally makes sense that that's contributing to the tailwind of supply
going forward. Real quick,
I'm just going to get this question out of my head. On your chart back
there where you had the natural gas liquid inputs,
we can refine those into oil right now. We couldn't really export that
right now, right?
We do. We export a lot. Do other countries have refineries that take that?
OK, sure. We're not the only ones doing this. In fact, if you look at the
it used to be the BP Annual Statistical Review of Energy,
which is sort of the Bible for analysts, I think in the latest report,
because of the U.S., something like 14 percent,
their definition of oil is as expansive as ours. So it's crude oil, shale
oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.
That's what they call oil. And the difference is the U.S. does that in some
of its reports and doesn't in other of its reports.
And so the U.S. is producing more like 20 million barrels a day,
not 13 when you add up all of the sources that BP would consider oil,
that we would consider oil.
I think the global NGL production is something like 14 million barrels a day.
I think Saudi Arabia, I believe, is the second largest and they're making
huge investments in natural gas.
Qatar's natural gas field has a lot of condensate that comes with it.
If you give industry cheap abundant hydrocarbons, they'll figure out a way
to use it. They'll figure out what to do with it.
Yeah, that's our view. And this once that flexibility investment is made,
it's quasi-permanent.
So back to this whole I've done the well count and I've done the rate count
and I'm looking at backwards data.
And historically when we look, we've fallen for those same mistakes like
this is new insights for us as we've grown.
Bloomberg, we've written 250 pieces. We learn every time we write, we get
feedback, we do more analysis, we do more research.
This is our current view. The world is amply supplied with an abundance
of hydrocarbons.
The definition of oil that historically has been used is too narrow.
We are swimming in a sea of natural gas. As a second order effect of that,
we're producing a lot more natural gas liquids.
Industry, having recognized this, made significant investments to handle it.
In fact, a lot of it is exported. People around the world find utility for
these molecules and eventually we just need to redefine what oil is.
OK, last question, sort of on the peak oil side of things.
I remember seeing an old chart and this might have been a conventional
oil discoveries.
But again, back to Matt Simmons, the whole peak oil, right? Conventional
oil fields peak on a bell curve.
The global oil field should peak similarly in terms of exploration discovery.
The big discoveries, I think, peaked back in the 60s or the 70s, if I'm
remembering this thing correctly.
Is there a concern of us just not finding more Permian basins and stuff
going forward or does the exploration outlook look more rosy than that?
You know, it's amazing if you just go back and plot US oil production
versus official US oil reserves, you will find for yourself the fallacy of
such thinking.
So what did Matt Simmons miss? He missed the shale revolution, which was
a technological one.
When we say peak cheap oil is a myth, what we really mean is technology
and then the politics.
So like Germany has an enormous amount of fracking potential and it's just
politically decided it's not going to do that.
There's all manner of fracking resources around the world that are waiting
to become reserves.
And we should define those two terms because they're actually financial terms.
They're not geologic terms. So a resource is an assessment that material
is there.
And a reserve is we've invested some money and now believe that they can
be economically exploited.
The US has way more resources that we believe should be labeled as reserves
that just aren't recognized yet because there's accounting reasons why.
And you have to like you have to formally prove, for example, the SEC that
you have converted a resource to reserve because that in theory makes your
company more valuable.
And if you haven't done the quote unquote official work to do that, that
doesn't mean that those aren't really reserves in practice.
And so, again, the fallacy of backwards looking data without proper technology
of today, let alone what's coming.
And considering the full economic definition of raises like resources and
reserves, it's easy to spin a negative outlook and look at just put a big
giant disclaimer on top of all of this.
This is just our view. We're here to defend it. We could be dead wrong. This
is our learned view based on the research we've done.
As we said, you know, in this piece that we've not yet published, as the
definition of oil expands, more resources become reserves.
Now, all of a sudden, you have to think about, well, Qatar is sitting on
the largest oil and condensate field in the world.
They have an enormous amount of natural gas left to produce very cheaply,
a straw on the ground, as you said.
Well, what are we doing with all that condensate? It's finding its way into
a refinery.
By our definition, it's oil. That condensate is not currently counted in
the world's, quote unquote, oil reserves, especially not the backwards
looking ones.
And so 50 years from now, we will be producing way more oil at the same
price as measured in gold that we do today is our base case.
And we would fade long term alarmist predictions.
That doesn't mean that we shut down shipping lanes in the Middle East and
a hot war breaks up between the US and Iran or Russia pulls this crude off
the market that we can't see 150 or $200 oil again.
But it does mean that in 2050, absent some political suicide, we're going
to be producing an enormous amount of oil.
All right. I was just about to go there with some of those risks, and it
sounds like you see them as certainly things that could happen, but are
likely to be incidents as opposed to long term trends.
All right. So let's go into your other recent piece here, where you talk about
how we tend to look at OPEC as really being the setter of global oil prices.
And we've talked a lot about the West wanting to be less dependent upon
foreign oil and stuff like that.
Your recent piece basically said if the Western Hemisphere kind of got its
act together more, it could basically completely defang the influence of OPEC.
You want to expound on that for us?
You bet. So the first thing that you have to realize, which will probably
come as a surprise to a lot of people, is that the Western Hemisphere today,
which is North America, Latin America, as defined, say, by the Monroe
Doctrine, which was the opening story of that piece,
the Western Hemisphere today already produces more oil than the Middle East
with at least one and a half hands tied behind its back.
And is that with the conventional definition of oil or with the Bloomberg
definition of oil?
It's with the BP definition of oil, which is crude oil, shale oil, oil sands,
condensates and NGLs,
which is quite similar to our preferred definition of any hydrocarbon that
finds its way into a refinery.
But this is how BP measures oil. And we would agree with it.
So by that correct definition of oil, the Western Hemisphere today produces
in 2022, by the way, the 23 numbers are final.
Thirty one point seven million barrels per day versus thirty point seven
million barrels in the Middle East.
Now, look, Venezuela is in the Western Hemisphere and people would count that
with OPEC and Brazil wants to join it, which is all things we acknowledge
in the piece.
But already today, the Western Hemisphere in isolation is a very, very it's
an energy behemoth.
And it could we could do so much more if we got our act together, as you
said, politically.
And we could walk through just the three or four examples that we highlighted
in that piece that would blow people's minds.
Like, again, when people argue about cheap oil, it it they're not counting
what's available and undeveloped because of political reasons and NGLs
and condensates.
And, you know, the ever evolving definition of oil and here just in the in
the Western Hemisphere, which really drives that point home.
Imagine, for example, if we took the the technology perfected in the Canadian
tar sands.
And deployed it in Venezuela, which, by the way, has the largest oil reserves
in the world,
which we think is a radical underestimation because when was the last time we
had a serious look using modern technology about what the resource reserve
mix is in a broken country like Venezuela?
That's just one example. Venezuela's oil production has fallen off.
You know, it's fallen to the floor. The chart in the piece that we showed,
which maybe you can pull up is the is the production of Canada versus
Venezuela, which has a similar sized deposit base and very similar grade
of crude.
Canada has since 2004 doubled its production and Venezuela's fallen by by
two thirds.
There's an enormous amount of potential in Venezuela. All right, I'm I'm
pulling that visual up right here.
And yet you can see it. This alligator jaws chart here of Canadian production
just rising, you know, right off into the right here where Venezuela is
just falling off a cliff here.
So do help us understand, like like let's get into those big opportunities,
but help us understand, like what are the big things getting in the way?
Politics primarily, which are a lot easier to change than geology. So let's
talk about Guyana.
That's suddenly in the news again. And I must say, we were surprised at
the quality of the of the resource that Exxon has been exploiting and looks
set to exploit to a significant extent versus what we had previously thought.
It just goes to show you like there's so much all right next to Venezuela. And
in fact, in disputed territorial waters sits one of the most exciting
developments in the modern world is a gold rush.
There it is. Yep. This is a picture that we that we found that it just
shows you right off the coast of Guyana.
Now, all of this territory is is claimed by Venezuela, and we'll see whether
this resolves peacefully. But we're seeing a literal gold rush in Guyana.
And if we so like as we close the peace, like imagine we could figure out
a peaceful resolution to this where the discovery of such huge amounts of
oil is leads to prosperity, not ruin.
We talked about Argentina and the peace. They have a huge fracking deposit
that is many think is on par with the Permian.
And boy, hasn't there been some political change there. And so when you add
it all up top to bottom, if we got out of our own way on energy in the Western
Hemisphere, we could add 10 to 15 million barrels a day of production easily.
What does that do, you know, for the next 10 to 15 years? So I'm going to
ask a very naive question. I know the answer is multifactorial and complex
and it has to do with politics and human nature and all that stuff.
But what more does it take? I mean, Venezuela, like you said, it's a broken
country. You know, I've traveled in South America relatively recently and
seen all the immigrants from Venezuela who are generally begging on the
streets and other neighboring countries.
Like, what does it take for a country to say, you know, there's probably
a better way to be doing this, particularly we've got such immense riches
just right here and many partners who are willing to help us go after it.
It's a scary question because Venezuela wasn't always that way. In the
'50s and '60s, it was in the '70s even, like before they went down the
wrong path. It was a wonderful place to be, truly.
It's a recent phenomenon that the country has slipped into political turmoil
and hyperinflation. And look, we are not immune from such risks, which is
why our preferred measurement of the cost of oil is ounces of gold.
If you measured the price of oil in Venezuelan dollars, it would be, yes,
peak cheap oil would be not a myth to them. But that's why we don't measure
it in the Venezuelan currency.
Today we measure it in U.S. dollars. It might not always be that way. We are
headed down a very dangerous path domestically in the U.S., like it's scary.
It's not a political show, and you and I are, you know, people don't come
to us for our political views, but it is objectively, to a neutral observer,
scary to see the polarity that is growing in the U.S. and our fiscal deficits
and all of these other things.
And when you look at the history of how once prosperous states fail, the
Venezuelan story is as old as time, and we're not here to underestimate
the difficulty of getting politics right.
But broadly speaking, integrated over humanity, we are going to grow energy
production 2% a year forever. That's our base case.
On timescales that matter, we will find a way. And fixing Venezuela,
you know, negotiating a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Guyana,
or getting behind the new president of Argentina as he tries to liberalize
the energy markets and dollarize his economy
so that he can avoid the sort of classic Dutch disease trap that emerging
economies fall into when they discover large riches like this. These are
all things that enough of them will work to ensure that that upward-sloping
sine wave of energy production grows at 2% a year.
Okay, so saying expect it to be messy, but expect it to end in that net
positive 2% per year growth trajectory. Well, let's just talk about America
for a second here. So yes, we could spend lots of time talking about, you
know, a lot of the concerning similarities that we're seeing kind of creep
into our own experience versus some of these other countries that have been
stuck in crisis forever, particularly fiscal crisis.
But I know we've talked about this a bit in the past in previous interviews,
but talk for a moment about any concerns you might have in terms of just
our energy policy, especially as it relates to oil, since that's what we're
talking about here,
where we are kind of at odds with, say, common sense and our own national
interests. There's been a lot of talk recently about how a lot of oil
companies are being disincented from making continued capital expenditures
here in the US and investment and infrastructure here in the US because
they don't have clarity on what the regulatory environment is going to
look like in 5, 10, 15 years and whether they're going to be able to get
a return off of dollars that they invest today.
So what are some of the biggest concerns you have right now?
I would say that concern might dampen what we could be investing, but we
are undergoing an investment boom across all aspects of the manufacturing
sector, which is part of the reason why we think we've not yet slipped into
a recession.
And just like we have a nuanced definition of oil, I think we need to
have a nuanced definition of America. And in fact, we have a piece that
we're working on right now, which we're trying to write in a way that is
politically aware but not political, tentatively titled Two Americas.
You can't look at the US as one homogeneous country. And in fact, unlike
most countries, the US energy policy is still largely governed at the state
level, which is why we have such wildly different energy policies, say,
between California and Texas.
And if you take the PAD system, P-A-D-D, which arose during World War II to
ration gasoline, and our energy is still calculated that way today, if you
sort of take the Two Americas and partition them between pro-hydrocarbon
and pro-global warming renewables,
you see an amazing disparity, even in the past 10 years, of who's producing
the energy in the US. And whether or not the people that are not producing
it can even get access to it. They don't have the pipelines, the Jones Act
prohibits the shipping from one US port to another.
And so if you put the country into sort of the West Coast and New England,
and then study US energy statistics partitioning between those two categories,
the difference is stark, and it's amazing.
And so yes, refiners in California are not investing. But all of that
investment to take advantage of NGLs is happening in Oklahoma and Texas
and Louisiana. And so what does that end state mean?
You know, there's a lot of talk about succession and the country breaking
apart. And that used to be sort of fringe talk, but it's becoming more and
more mainstream.
And it's kind of scary to contemplate. But if we do end up breaking up
along those lines, as we said, there's Two Americas and one of them is an
energy vassal.
Like, all of the energy is produced in what the coastal elite would call
flyover country. And that's where we think the power would lie in a sort
of breakup scenario.
There isn't really one America, like California produces none of its own
energy, basically. And, you know, Texas on a standalone basis would be,
you know, a peer of Saudi Arabia.
Yeah, and what's interesting is California has the potential to produce an
awful lot more than it does, right?
Of course. We all have the potential to make 10 nuclear power plants per
state and solve the problem. We didn't even talk about uranium.
Yeah, we haven't yet. We have talked about it a bit in the past. But it's
politics. So, like, if you just look at how hard Joe Manchin had to work to
get the Mountain Valley pipeline project over the line, which has allowed
sort of Pennsylvania and West Virginia to participate in this natural gas
boom, that shows you just the disparity in politics.
Like, New England cannot tap into the natural gas that's being produced
200 or 300 miles away. It imports LNG from Trinidad and Tobago.
Is anybody working on that right now? Or is that just mindset that's not
shifting?
If anything, we're working further apart. Is the country becoming less
polar? Like, you can draw the energy strategy as a function of the red-blue
divide.
And how do we write about that in a way that isn't taking sides in that
divide is something we're struggling with, if I'm being totally honest. You
just have to be an agnostic observer and see that this is happening.
Yeah, and I'm curious, how about, especially like in the Northeast, how much
of it is ideological, right, versus just a collective action problem where
you've just got a lot of little states and it's hard to get them all to agree?
It's ideological. I mean, this is purely ideological. And that's fine. Like,
you have to respect that ideology. But this is part of the driving force
of the partitioning of the American political fabric, which we would all
agree is concerning and unlikely to end well.
But when it does end, and the pieces are analyzed, I think it would be wise
for people who care about the energy markets to partition the US into those
separate fragments, because for all intents and purposes, they are.
All right. I'm feeling the pressure here of having maybe two more hours
worth of questions for you on this topic and only having a couple of minutes
left. Let me toss this grenade and we'll just have to let it do what it
does and pick up the pieces later.
You know, obviously, we have a massive movement right now towards a
greeting of the US energy system. I'm sure it is nuanced and, you know,
again, multifactorial, but on a net basis, is that helping things out here?
Or are we perhaps devoting way too much human capital, financial capital, you
know, energy and focus somewhere where maybe it could be better directed on
some of the elements that you were talking about earlier, but if we really
got our act together on oil?
I would say that it is adding to the political divide. And the hyper
politicization of energy is not beneficial to either side. And I think
the forced introduction of intermittent, unreliable renewables is going to
cause a series of problems.
And when those problems arise, the attribution of the source of those
problems will be just as hyper political as ever.
And we saw it when there were struggles in Texas and the renewables crowd
blamed it on natural gas when I would say they had it reversed. You know,
they just were very clever in their propaganda and got their first counter
accusations into the media before the industry knew what to do.
And we're seeing in sort of purple states like Michigan implementing German
energy policies, despite having the playbook in front of them as to where
that eventually goes. And those states are far more closely divided on the
issue than the policies would represent.
Then, say, California, I would say that California is undeniably far more
blue than sort of swing state Michigan. And so when we see such policies
drive challenges, who gets the blame for that just becomes another thing
for the team sports, the political team sports to argue over.
It's an investment in further polarity and less unity, which is disturbing
and unhelpful.
We have plenty enough energy. We don't need intermittent renewables. Any
challenges that come from that are just going to be further friction points
for society.
And frankly, I think you and I could both agree, and maybe this is a great
point to close on, that we could all do with a few less friction points in
our society today.
I think we and everybody viewing can agree with that statement. For folks
that are interested in delving a bit more into what Bloomberg just was
talking about here in terms of some of the risks that the renewable movement
potentially may be creating in terms of grid integrity. The day we're talking
here, Bloomberg, you just published a piece called Inverted Priorities,
which basically does a deep dive into this topic. And so folks that are
interested in this topic could go there and read this piece, correct?
Absolutely. Just published this morning, hot off the presses.
Okay, great. Now, bringing it back to my early question, which is your
2024 outlook for supply and price for oil. We're currently trading in the
70s. Do you see us as kind of hanging out here in this space while we have
this relative excess for the year?
Or, I mean, I know we can't predict geopolitical surprises that might happen
down the road, but barring any of those, do you see stability or do you
see a different trend here?
We would be mildly bearish, absent geopolitical events. I think that the
Chinese economy remains the big question mark and no Western analyst can
tell you with any sort of precision or confidence what's going on inside
that black box.
And so just based on the supply dynamics and the relatively decent economic
numbers that we're seeing, all things being equal, a relatively slow drift
down as geopolitical risks abate would be our base case.
Things that could change that would be an unexpected outbreak of peace
between Russia and Ukraine that would be more bearish for energy. A hot
war spreading between the U.S. and Iran would be bullish for energy in the
same way that an unexpected peace deal in the Middle East that sidelines
Hamas and allows for the ever-elusive two-state solution to be permanently
imposed would be very, very bearish for the energy complex.
But by and large, all things being equal, because our base case view is
that the world is currently in a situation of relative energy abundance. We
haven't even talked about the interdependencies of these markets and how
hydropower in China affects the coal price in Appalachia.
These things are so intertwined. Our base view is at the moment, talking
to you today, New Year's 2024, the world is amply supplied, and we would
be cautious to express bullish views in the energy sector with that mindset.
Okay, and that is with status quo geopolitics. We haven't really talked about
the economy yet, but obviously it sounds like if the soft landers are right,
you're mildly bearish. I'm assuming if the hard landers are right in terms
of the economy slipping into recession this year, that would make you even
more bearish on the price of oil?
Yeah, although I would say it's funny. If shortages of oil catalyze
recessions, which is sort of the common first-level belief of people,
what does an abundance of cheap hydrocarbons mean for the U.S. economy?
We have natural gas at $2 per million BTU, which is $13 an oil of one of
the most important primary energy feedstocks that feeds industry. How is
it that extreme price hikes in oil are bad for the economy, but swimming
in a sea of hydrocarbons is somehow a catalyst for a recession?
Let me ask you this. Is $70 oil cheap? Well, what's the price of NGLs
and what's the price of natural gas on a comparative basis to the rest
of the world? So if you're a fertilizer plant sitting in the U.S. today,
you have access to the largest source of cheap hydrocarbons that have ever
been produced.
Sure, that's a great arbitrage. I totally get that on the natural gas side
of things. Absolutely. Chemicals, natural gas, road pavers, all of the
heavy manufacturing. Look, this comes at a time when we want to re-shore
or French shore out of China because of those geopolitical constraints,
which we didn't even touch on.
Look, if China makes a move on Taiwan, all bets are off. We could see
$200 oil overnight. But if we're going to be investing massively in our
manufacturing sector, boy, having the world's most abundant and cheapest
sources of hydrocarbons is probably a pretty good place to start.
Okay. All right. A lot of people out there understandably pointing to lots
of shortcomings that the American economy is facing right now. You're giving
us some good reasons to be optimistic here.
You know, that's why it's a market. And if we're dead wrong, we'll be the
first to admit it and come back on and try to understand why we were wrong
so that we could get better going forward. But based on our analysis,
having done deep dives recently on natural gas and Permian and in the
Western Hemisphere in general.
And, you know, it just seems like people are radically underestimating the
consequence of the energy crisis. And to return to the quote that we began
with, you know, it's very rare that you see a chronic shortage not followed
by a glut.
Got it. All right. Well, one last question for you before we start to wrap
things up here. This is an investing channel. You've given us a great way
to look at the energy landscape or particularly the oil landscape that
we've been talking about here.
I guess sticking in the oil space for a moment. Where do you see the
opportunities right now for investors in the oil space? Yeah, I would say
that we generally like the shovels to gold miners approach.
And so to the extent that you're looking at engineering firms or or
investments necessary to take advantage of cheap hydrocarbons. So, for
example, midstream players, which our friend Matt Solar would say, operate a
bit a bit as an oligopoly or in some cases, even as a as a regulated monopoly.
There's all manner of ways to take advantage of these trends where you can
express a view that is independent of, well, nothing could ever be fully
independent of the price of the commodity itself.
But wherever you see constraints, investing in the underlying technologies
that can unlock those constraints is usually a pretty good idea.
And so that's kind of where we would focus our efforts. OK, great. All
right. Well, then, look, in wrapping up here, Doonberg, these discussions
are always wonderful and always leave me wanting to keep the clock going.
I wish we could. Just means we're not going to have to have you back on
again soon. For folks that have really enjoyed this discussion, we would
like to follow you in your work, maybe even go read that article we talked
about just a few minutes ago.
Where should they go? Yeah, everything is at Doonberg.substack.com, which
is, you know, we've recently focused all of our efforts on the platform.
We've left Twitter and we do all of our sort of day to day stream of
conscious stuff on on Substacks Notes platform, which is sort of a growing
version of what some of Twitter used to be.
And we published six to eight times a month through Doonberg.substack.com. We
have a page where we list all of our podcast appearances and so on.
And so that would be the main place for people to go if they want to
find more.
All right. And when I edit this, I will put that link up here prominently on
the screen so folks know exactly where to go. Folks, there'll be a link to
it in the description below, too, so you can get there with one click access.
All right. I've got just a couple of quick things to mention to folks. And
then my last question for you is coming up in about 30 seconds, Doonberg,
and that's going to be we've been talking a lot about the energy markets,
oil, financial issues.
What is one non-financial, non-monetary related investment that you would
encourage folks to make in their lives? Think about that for the next 30
seconds while I just wrap up here.
Real quick, folks, if you've enjoyed having Doonberg on here, we'd like to
have him come back on the channel again soon to discuss maybe some of the
other elements of the energy system that we haven't talked about.
Or if he sees a change heading on in any of the markets we talked about
today, please vote your support for that by hitting the like button, then
clicking on the red subscribe button below.
There's that little bell icon right next to it. I just want to give a plug in,
Doonberg, I'm going to surprise you here. I haven't asked you officially this
yet, but folks, I am now working on Thoughtful Money's first ever conference.
This will be a continuation of the twice yearly conferences that I've done
in the past. So our spring conference is going to be happening in early March.
Doonberg, we'd love to have you be a presenter at that conference if you're
up for it.
100%, of course, anytime.
All right. Thanks, folks. I haven't locked in the date for that quite just
yet, but I will in the next couple of days, and I'll be letting you know
on this channel. So just stay tuned for that.
And then last, like Doonberg, as we mentioned at the beginning of this
conversation, I have recently created a substack for Thoughtful Money on
substack as well.
I give lots of information throughout the week about all the goings on that
are here. And if you want to enjoy my Adam's Notes, which I have started
publishing again, which are my detailed writeups to all the interviews I
do here, including this one with Doonberg,
just head over to AdamTaggart.substack.com. And if you want to get the
notes, become a premium subscriber, they get the notes as well as a number
of other special benefits.
All right. So Doonberg, we're here at that last question. What is a
non-monetary, non-financial investment that you've encouraged folks to make
in their lives?
Yeah. One thing I've always done in my life is I have proactively invested
a meaningful portion of my time developing my own skills.
And I do believe that learning, becoming better at things, diving into new
areas, proactively having a personal skill development planned as a New
Year's resolution is amongst the highest return investment that you can
make in yourself.
Nobody gets poorer when they get more skilled. And, you know, as we've
grown Doonberg, for example, we've gotten better at using our Bloomberg.
We've gotten better at doing photo shots. We've gotten tighter in our
editing. We've gotten better in our promotion skills. These are investments
that pay off over the life of your career.
And having a proactive, strategic personal skill development plan, in addition
to your annual tactical objectives of getting that raise or, you know,
getting some deal closed or meeting some return in the market, we think is
just as important and probably even more valuable, especially if you have
the discipline to do it over periods measured in decades.
Amen, brother. That is such a great answer. I agree 100 percent with
you. And to let you know who else does, I was talking on this program a
few weeks ago about how when I was in business school, I actually got to
meet Warren Buffett.
He was a surprise guest at one of my classes, and we just got to ask him
questions for an hour and a half.
That was one of the number one takeaways that he was making sure that we
all left with, which was investing in yourself is the best, highest return
investment you can make.
