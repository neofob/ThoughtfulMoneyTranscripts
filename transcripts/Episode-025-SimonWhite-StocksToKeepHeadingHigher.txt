Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
Wall Street was extremely pessimistic heading into 2023 and the year surprised to the upside.
Here at the end of the year, markets are now brimming with optimism and the S&P is trading
at an all time high.
So is the momentum likely to continue?
Or will 2024 be another surprise year for investors, but this time to the downside?
For an analyst perspective, we turn to Simon White, macro strategist at Bloomberg and co
founder of the investment advisory firm Variant Perception.
Simon, thanks so much for joining us today, all the way from Scotland.
Yeah, all the way fresh from Scotland, even with a genuine Scottish accent as well.
Alright, well, I love it.
Simon, I have read your work now for at least a year and a half and wanted to interview
you and it has taken me a long time to be able to figure out how to make that happen.
Thank you so much for agreeing to come on the program here.
I'm very excited for this.
You write a great analysis.
You create a lot of great charts, some of which you've already prepared for the audience
here.
Can't wait to walk through them with you.
Really quickly, before we get into the details, let me just start with the general question
I like to kick these discussions off with, what's your current assessment of the global
economy and financial markets?
Yes, very good question to begin with.
And as you say, very broad, but where we are today, I think is very interesting, partly
because we are still kind of coming out of the ripple effects from the pandemic.
And that's obviously just throwing all kind of standard analysis really out the window.
It hasn't necessarily turned it upside down, but it has pushed things very much out of
sync.
So there's an analogy used, the bullwhip effect and to talk about consumers, but you can use
that thinking about that more broadly.
We have had a number of cycles coming out of the pandemic and if you think of them like
different whips, if you like different bull whips, they are out of sync.
And I think that has thrown a lot of standard analysis out of the window, it's made the
recession look like it's imminent for a long time now, and obviously we're still really
not there.
Certainly when it comes to an NBER recession, I think there's other ways you can obviously
talk about a recession, but I think you have to be very clear about what you mean and well
defined.
And I think the NBER are a good referee.
And I think also at the same time, we have had very favourable liquidity conditions.
And so you kind of had these two almost contradictory things that I think have led to a lot of confusion
in markets.
You know, economies and markets do not always operate in the same cycle and they don't always
necessarily do what you think they might do.
Just because the economy is bad doesn't necessarily mean the markets are in bad shape and vice
versa, just because the economy is doing well, it doesn't mean that you know you're going
to have necessarily good markets.
So we've had a lot of kind of ripple effects that are operating out of sync.
And I think that's left, as I say, a lot of predictions kind of by myself included, my
predictions included, you know, I think recession has looked imminent for a heck of a long time
and it hasn't arrived.
We've had kind of recession illusion and, you know, one of the reasons for that really
is that you've had the goods and the service economy have operated out of sync since coming
out of the pandemic.
So we had a goods, very strong goods recovery was the first part of the economy to recover
out of the pandemic, but then it began to decline, but from a very high level.
And at the same time, you have the services economy was gradually improving.
And while we've had what looks like, you know, declining goods from a very high level and
services have continued to rise, we have not had goods and services economies at the same
time contracting.
And that's generally what you need to see to have a full blown recession.
So what has kind of thrown traditional analysis out the window?
Is it traditional leading indicators such as, you know, the conference boards, LEI,
for instance, are strongly correlated to the goods economy.
And so in that sense, they've kind of been right, because we have had a good recession,
but because the service economy has been gradually improving the whole time, and it's never collapsed
at the same time, and we just haven't had the two sides of the economy contracting at
the same time and we haven't had the recession.
So that's where we are today.
We can get into, obviously, what the forward looking stuff is, you know, in the discussion.
But that's kind of where we're left today.
And I think that's why the real sort of main driver of why things have been kind of difficult
to put your finger on for the last two years.
Okay, great.
Yeah, I do want to go into the details of each of those issues and where you see them
headed.
First, let me just ask.
So I'm very familiar with the Bullwhip effect, actually have put out videos trying to explain
it for people.
And they can be highly disruptive, actually, even in normal times.
But we had the pandemic come and really just, you know, shake the whole global economy,
scramble everything.
You said that we're still recovering from that.
Two questions.
One, where are we in that recovery?
Are we now mostly recovered?
And are we recovering back to a sense of normalcy where the old rules will continue to apply?
Or has anything been sort of permanently changed by the unprecedented nature of everything
we went through over the past couple years?
I think the second part of the question, I think it's too early to tell, you know, will
we revert to normal cycles that kind of operate in the way that they have in the past?
I think I think it's too early to tell as far as like, you know, are we at a sense of,
you know, how much of the recovery is taking place already?
I think things will still continue to operate perhaps at sync for a little bit longer.
So we have, you know, recession risk.
I think, you know, certainly up until a few months ago was quite, you know, it looked
very imminent that we're going to get recession.
And then if you actually look at the, again, I stick to the NBER, because you look at GDI,
you can say we've already had a recession.
If you look at manufacturing, we've already had a recession, you could look at earnings.
And you know, I think the two quarters of consecutive decline in GDP, I think that's
too simplistic.
And so that's why, you know, I stick to the NBER, they don't tell you exactly how they,
you know, call a recession, but they do tell you some of the main indicators, you know,
there's four things they look at, look at payrolls, they look at real PCE, look at industrial
production, and they look at real personal income, less transfer payments.
And actually, I think that's one of the charts on the slides that we've got there, we can
look at, which is on, I think it's slide number seven.
Yeah, so the chart on the left there.
So you know, for the NBER to call a recession, if you look historically, all four of these
indicators have been in contraction at the same time.
And the only exception was 2001, and that's when you didn't have real PCE was was not
contracting, but the other three were.
And if you look at where we are today, so the chart on the right kind of zooms in to
where we are today.
And you can see there, you know, you have the non-farm payrolls, so job growth has been
getting, the job market has been slowing, and it's been slowing gradually, so slowing
from a high level.
And you can see that that's still above contraction.
And that fact, if you look at leading indicators of payrolls, for instance, claims, claims
is actually a very good shorter term leading indicator for payrolls that's inflected higher
again.
So you know, all the things that I was looking at was kind of the trajectory was heading
one direction.
So you're expecting to see a much worse job market much quicker.
But we've had this kind of like, you know, the rugs been taken from beneath your feet.
And some indicators like claims have started to inflect higher.
So that's really sort of suggesting that the any sort of NBR recession has been delayed,
not often, definitely, of course, you know, the last person to say, you know, the end
of boom and bust or one of the last people was Gordon Brown, and he was proven magnificently
wrong.
So, you know, I don't you premature and think this is there's no recession coming, a recession
will come.
But it looks like it's been delayed.
And if you look at the bottom half of the second chart, you know, you can see that,
you know, IP is kind of bumping around zeros industrial production is kind of bumping around
zero, whereas real personal income, you know, it's still above zero factors in anything
it might even be inflecting something higher, I mean, real wage growth is case not as high
as it was, but it's still positive.
So you know, wages are still growing in real terms.
And in fact, if you look at some survey data, for instance, the NFIB compensation plans has
just inflected higher, if you look at a lot of the feds, survey wage data, these things
lead to wages, you know, by three to six months, they've started to inflect higher.
So it's very hard to fashion an argument, and it says we're going to get an NBR recession,
you know, very soon.
And this is not all academic, by the way that, you know, the NBR, the problem with the NBR
or any sort of recession dating body is that they will always date recession after the
fact.
But if we look at, as I say, leading indicators for all these indicators, the NBR look at
were it the jobs, or we look at income, or even industrial production, the leading indicators
for these are actually inflecting higher right now, and these leads, as I say, with a three
to six month lead.
So it's not like there's any imminent sign that they're going to suddenly turn down that,
by the way, is tend to what tends to be what happens in recessions, things do move very
fast, but there's nothing in these very reliable leading indicators that suggest that's going
to happen.
And certainly not in the next three to six months.
So you know, the recession risk has receded for now.
But there is still recession risk, and I think that's going to come from, and that's the
next slide, is going to come from the slow impact of rising rates.
So the first thing to say is, you know, the actual debt, you know, DSRs, or the debt service
ratios are actually not as high as, again, people might think, you know, we've just had
this massive, you know, very fast interest rate rise from the Fed, right, over 500 basis
points in quite a short space of time.
But the real, I guess, the game changer, because the biggest part of kind of certainly households
debt levels is mortgages.
And because you have so many people on longer duration fixed rates, and that's really shielded
them in quite a big way from from the kind of like the shop window, mortgage rate shop
window mortgage rates were up 8%, or maybe back down about seven now, and the kind of
effective rate is more like three and a half, and that's only climbing quite slowly.
And so well, you know, the chart on the left there, you can see the consumption debt service
ratio has risen, and that's higher than it was pre pandemic, the, the white line, which
is the mortgage one is still lower.
And that means that the total one, which is the blue line is about roughly the same as
where it was pre pandemic.
And so you know, the overall kind of pain, if you like, right now, here and now, broadly
speaking, there are obviously individual pockets of pain for sure, but on the aggregate level,
it's just not there.
It's not where you'd expect it to be.
And a huge part of this, there's two big things is the government running the largest peacetime
non recessionary deficit that ever has, that's one big thing.
And the second thing is, you know, despite the Fed, you know, doing QT, and it's up to
$95 billion a month, and it still has over $7 trillion of assets, so $7 trillion of duration
risk on its balance sheet.
And that has an enormous shielding impact on the economy that certainly I didn't appreciate
at the very beginning of last year, and I was a lot more negative, and I thought a recession
was a lot more imminent.
But again, I was, you know, using traditional leading indicators, which have an excellent
track record.
But at that time, maybe not fully appreciating just how out of sync the economy was coming
out of coming out the pandemic, but this this will change, you know, but we're not going
to get a free pass forever.
So you know, for instance, you know, corporates have also benefited or not benefited well,
in fact, they have a net benefit so far from higher rates, because they've been quite kind
of deft in their in their in their way that they have, if you like, manage their duration
risk, they were essentially increasing their duration risk when rates were very, very low,
you know, the very before the Fed start to raise them, and then you start to reduce duration
risk, and when rates start to rise, and they also increase their exposure to short term,
like money market funds and bills, where rates were obviously rising, you know, rates were
up at over 5%.
So the net interest income was actually rising, but that will that's changing.
So the chart on the right there shows that, you know, as sort of next year goes on, that
that's likely to change that white line is likely to start reflecting higher.
So the kind of free pass, if you like, so households have had a kind of free pass or
looking shielded from mortgage rates, but that effective rates creeping up, you know,
there are still 25% of people on arms, you know, adjustable, reset mortgages, so they
will gradually have to fix at higher rates.
And that's why the effective rate is moving.
And corporates will gradually have to pay more interest.
So as that process continues to take place, you know, recession risk, you know, will rise,
but I think that's very much the second half of the year thing at the earliest.
All right.
So you're basically saying, we had we had a guest on this program two weeks ago, Wolf
Richter, who sort of made the comment, Hey, I think we would like for us to have a recession,
because we I think we deserve one.
And I think there's a lot of sort of, you know, malinvestment that needs to sort of
be cleared out. And he said, looking at the data, I just don't see one happening anytime
soon.
I kind of hear you saying a similar story is that but saying, hey, you do think that
over time, the lag effect is going to catch up with this economy.
This chart here on the right, the corporates interest payment ones, I know that's a real
head scratcher for folks, right?
Because you're like, Oh, my God, we've had this tremendous increase in the cost of debt.
And yet, the net interest payments is going down on average across corporates income statements.
To your prediction here that eventually that's going to that's going to reverse.
Given your current calculation of the maturity wall that lies ahead from here, when do you
expect that to reverse and to start to matter?
I think I just heard you say that's going to be a story of the second half of 2024.
Is that kind of when you're beginning to expect that to bite?
Yeah, I mean, it's not an exact science.
And, you know, obviously, that chart there, you can see, so that the blue line, just to
be clear, has been pushed forward already.
And they're pushed forward by a year.
But, you know, it's not exact science.
But when I look at something like that, that tells me it's probably not an imminent leading
relationship, like it's not something in the next few months, is probably like six to 12.
And that's obviously just historically, how long it's taken for, you know, these higher
interest rates to really feed through and have that sort of negative negative impact.
I think the impact to households is slower, it seems to be, you know, obviously, after
the financial crisis, I think, during the financial crisis, arms were like, more than
50% of mortgages, and there was a huge reduction in that, in the years following the financial
crisis, they've been in it bottomed, maybe a few years ago, and as I say, it's back up
at 25%, but that really sort of is a very kind of effective break, if you like, of stopping
that transmission mechanism.
And that's really the overall message here is that the transmission mechanism from higher
rates, through things like adjustable rate mortgages through corporates being savvy with
their managing their interest rate risk, also, of course, banks and they have this time you
look at banks net interest margins, they've risen, as they tend to when rates rise, throw
in the fact that the Fed is warehousing $7 trillion of, you know, duration risk, and
then the cherry in the cake is that the government's spending $2 trillion x-ish a year, and all
these things are really mitigating what otherwise would have caused a lot of damage.
And then as I say, throwing into the confusion, is the fact that everything is out of sync,
coming out of the pandemic, you know, all different parts of the economy are kind of
operating at different speeds.
And because they're asynchronous, to say it's causing a lot of hitherto sort of reliable
relationships, and not to operate in the way that you'd expect them to.
And as I say, when it comes to assets, that this is the other side of this thing, right,
is you have this kind of confusing backdrop that, you know, could look quite negative.
But you also have extremely buoyant liquidity conditions.
So one of the most useful, and I mean useful in the terms of the way that it has a leading
effect, or sorry, as a leading relationship with asset prices, which kind of like really,
if you're looking at other stuff, you know, hand you an investor, it's really that's what
matters to you most, right?
You can pontificate about the economy to the cows come home, but really what you're interested
in is what does it mean for assets?
And that's why excess liquidity, which is the difference between real money growth and
economic growth is so useful, and it's quite intuitive kind of indicator because, you know,
money is created by banks and central banks.
And what isn't used up by the needs of the real economy is, you know, quote, unquote,
excess.
And that excess liquidity tends to find its way into risk assets.
And if you look back in March, you know, things were pretty negative back then.
But what really happened then is an inflection higher in access liquidity, you had a combination
of things, you had money growth, okay, it wasn't rising, particularly, but it stopped
falling.
And because the central banks have been tightening, and, but growth was quite slow growth was
relatively slow.
And on top of that, the dollar had been weakening.
And because excess liquidity, global excess liquidity is in dollar terms, that weakening
in the dollar boosted excess liquidity.
So I think that's kind of underappreciated how important it was.
The dollar weakening this year to really help excess liquidity and therefore really help
the risk asset rally that we've had for most of the year.
But kind of it was counterintuitive, excess liquidity tends to be rising when people are
most pessimistic.
So there's something inherently contrarian about the indicator as well, which is kind
of great from a markets perspective, you know, markets tend to have their biggest moves when
people least expect it, right.
People tend to extrapolate linearly, then the market turns and does something that no
one else really expects.
And that's when you tend to have the biggest moves in markets.
So that that liquidity situation has been very favorable.
And it's been really another dynamic this year, which is unique, we haven't had this
before, is the fact that we've had a fiscal huge fiscal deficit.
Now that would normally be quite problematic for liquidity, because you essentially have
not to go into too much detail, but you have huge number of treasuries that essentially
crowd out other assets and essentially crowd out liquidity.
But because the Treasury decided to skew issuance to builds, so this is essentially like people
talk about the Powell pivot, this was the Yellen pivot.
And this happened, you know, really the beginning of this year, so the end of 2022, beginning
of 2023, the Treasury decided to skew its issuance hugely towards bill.
So most of its actual borrowing was done in bills.
And this enabled the idle liquidity that was sat in the Fed's reverse repo facility to
essentially mitigate the loss of liquidity that would otherwise happen if you're trying
to issue so many treasuries.
So by issuing bills, it allowed the money market funds, mainly money market funds to
intermediate in this borrowing, and you get the best of both worlds.
Normally you would get fiscal, you know, deficit's great because it's good for the economy, but
it would have problems for, as I say, for liquidity, and that's not great for risk assets
necessarily.
But this time round, we got the economic boost of the fiscal deficit, and there was no impact
to liquidity reserves, central bank reserves actually rose.
And this is despite the fact the Fed's doing QUT.
So if you look at reserves, they're actually higher now than when the Fed's started QUT
in June 2022.
So this is like a fiscal deficit on speed, you know, it's a complete best of all worlds
for risk assets.
And again, it's a very different dynamic.
So if you're not really following what's happening, it's not obvious.
People will try and attach narratives to why such and such is happening to markets, but
really what drives markets is liquidity.
And as I say, you've had positive excess liquidity.
And this time around, you've had this extra dynamic of central bank liquidity being supported
by the Treasury's actions.
All right, let me just interject for a second.
So first off, the video preceding this one, Simon, was with Michael Howell, and we did
a deep dive into liquidity, because that's really his area of specialization.
And at least some of the folks watching this, you know, have been introduced to that reality
that you just mentioned, which is despite the fact that we have been in an aggressive
rate hike regime with many of the major central banks in the world, and the Fed's done over
a trillion in QT, and the narrative is that, okay, well, we're draining the pond here.
That's not the case.
Economic liquidity has been rising pretty much ever since October of 2022.
And of course, that's when the stock market bottomed and we had a great year in the markets
this year.
And lo and behold, you know, the very direct correlation between net liquidity and asset
prices is holding here, right?
So looking through that lens, as you're saying, you're not terribly surprised.
Now, you're saying it's not just sort of a standard form of liquidity.
It's kind of like liquidity plus or QE plus the way that it's happening for the reasons
that you mentioned.
And one thing I just want to make sure that folks understand, and maybe you can elaborate
a little bit more, is this isn't just sort of your regular liquidity stuff.
This is an orchestrated back and forth handing of the baton back and forth between the Fed
and the US Treasury.
And Treasury obviously is run by Janet Yellen, who had the head of the Fed job before Jerome
Powell.
So do we really indeed have this sort of coordinated synchronized plan here where sort of the Fed
was relying on the Treasury to provide liquidity while the Fed was going through its tightening
and hiking regimes?
And then now that the baton is being handed back to the Fed to say, hey, now that perhaps
because interest on the national debt is now in the process of raising so much, and that's
really beginning to bite our budget, all right, Powell, now you get to start bringing rates
down to mitigate against that.
Did I describe it correctly in terms of how you look at it?
Yeah, I mean, that's exactly it.
I mean, first of all, well, very first of all, I guess I wouldn't describe it as sort
of QE plus.
I think that to sort of use that term creates a lot of confusion because QE plus, they're
actually buying assets, we know they're not, and their balance sheet would actually be
expanding.
It isn't.
Okay.
Let's say net positive liquidity plus.
There is the high powered liquidity that tends to or can support risk asset markets is rising
and not falling.
And that's the critical thing here.
The second thing in terms of coordination between, if you like, team fiscal and the
monetary now, we'll never know, of course, because obviously central banks officially
are still independent.
But historically, if you look at central banking, for most of its existence, it's never been
independent.
It's essentially been an arm of the state.
And central bank independence is only a sort of relatively recent phenomenon.
And now if you're a central banker, you might argue that central banking independence over
the last 20, 30 years, roughly, that's why we've had lower inflation.
Central banks have had inflation targets, they've done their job very well.
We've had low inflation, the so-called nice decades, non-inflationary, continuous expansion.
But now things have changed.
We've now, for the first time in decades, we've had very high inflation.
And I think we can get into this as well later on if we have time, but I think inflation
will return.
I think it's way too early to sound it all clear on inflation.
I think we're in an inflation regime.
This cycle is going to be extremely different and last probably a lot longer than many people
think.
But the existence of inflation, now it's back, that means de facto central bank independence
is kind of over.
I mean, it will continue in name, but it's already happening.
I mean, you can't have a government running that big a fiscal deficit outside a recession
and still have independent central banks.
You can't have three quarters of a trillion up to a trillion money sitting in the Treasury's
account at the Fed and still have central bank independence.
So already the lines are becoming blurred.
It will never be kind of made explicit.
And when it comes to, I mentioned what I called the Yellen pivot earlier on, that made, if
you like Powell's job a lot easier, now whether it's coordinated or not, sometimes you don't
even need to be told what to do.
You just know what the right thing is to do.
And I'm sure someone smart at the Treasury knew that they could take advantage of this
idle liquidity sitting in the RRP and the way to do it was to issue lots of bills because
then we could have rates still up at five and a half percent, but not crash the market.
And we know that neither the Treasury or the Fed really want to do that no matter what
they say.
So, great, fantastic, but as you alluded to, the problem is now you now have this massive
government issuance, which is going to lead to, or already is a huge interest rate expense
bill.
Now I remember looking at this thinking, well, that can't be a major problem, but the actual
numbers are quite crazy.
I mean, already it's around about 3% of total debt outstanding.
You can basically just use, by the way, just use the 10 year as a proxy for how much the
government has to pay on its interest rate bill.
Obviously the 10 year over the last several months has risen quite a lot.
And if you look, and it leads that interest rate bill by about six months.
And so therefore the expected interest rate bill next year is going to be something in
the region of four and a half to 5%, which is about in number terms, about the GDP of
Spain.
And that's an annual number, right?
And the problem with that, of course, you have to borrow more to pay your interest bill.
So first of all, that's not great for the national debt that you're having to borrow
more just to pay interest, but when it comes more immediately, when it comes to liquidity.
So that very conducive backdrop I was talking about with the Yellen pivot, that they were
able to basically run this fiscal deficit and keep reserve support even while QUT was
ongoing.
In fact, reserves were rising.
And so we had the Everthing rally, but that weight, that gravity, if you like, from this
interest rate expense would gradually really start to suck reserves known in two ways.
It would limit their velocity and it would also potentially reduce the amount in a system.
And historically, that's what you've seen, right?
When interest rate expense rises, government's interest rate expense rises, reserves tend
to fall.
And as I say, even if they don't fall, their velocity will tend to fall.
And the reason is, is that government's taxes are essentially paid from back deposits, and
then they're paid to people that hold government debt.
And the general thinking is that that's not a problem because the people that own that
debt then spend that interest.
So it should be kind of circular.
But if you look at who holds US treasuries, the only real holders that are likely to spend
in the economy, if you like, are households and corporates.
But they're only 10%, roughly, of treasuries outstanding.
And even then, they're unlikely to spend all of their interest payments.
90% of treasuries are held by financials and by foreigners.
Now, financials are more likely to reinvest it.
Again, some could be spent, but when we're looking at the numbers here, you can see that
there's a high chance that a lot of that interest income is going to be reinvested.
And even if it's reinvested, the propensity it has to be held by someone who's likely
to spend it becomes less.
So the more it filters through the economy, the more it filters through to the people
that are less likely to spend and more likely to save.
So that interest income becomes less stimulatory.
And it becomes more likely to be held as savings.
And therefore, the velocity of the reserves, if you like, the bank deposits, whatever you
want to call it, but the bank deposits and the reserves are obviously related to one
another and declines.
Or outright, you could see a decline in reserves purely because some of the reinvested income
ends up at the back of the RRP, assuming at some point the RRP becomes more attractive
than bills, which is quite possible because front-end rates are already falling.
The Fed has pivoted, and also because at some point, Yellen will probably renege somewhat
from her pivot because right now they're issuing bills hand over fist.
So bill rates would be like to fall.
So you've kind of had like, maybe Yellen did Powell a favor by issuing bills, and now we've
had the reverse.
Powell has now done Treasury a favor by trying to reduce its interest rate bill.
So they've kind of tried to buy more time into next year to keep the game going a little
bit longer.
Right.
Although Powell has suggested he's going to help by bringing rates down, it hasn't actually
cut rates yet.
And one question I have with this liquidity is the more that we push liquidity into the
system and the more that we create a wealth effect, which is definitely going on right
now with the markets, right?
They're in full party mode now.
Spending goes up.
We've got this momentum of workers starting to demand higher wages as well.
We'll see what happens with that.
But my point is, is that inflationary?
And does that actually potentially hinder Powell's true ability to bring rates down
as much as he'd like to because all of a sudden inflation starts coming back?
Very good question.
I think they have significantly increased inflation risks.
It will obviously take some time to filter through, but analogies obviously can be quite
lazy.
But I think to look at the seventies or even the forties, everything, nothing will be exactly
the same.
But the one thing that is immutable through everything you look at in financial history
or any history is human behavior.
And I think that what happened in the seventies could be repeated to some extent this time
round because in the seventies you had the same kind of conditions that created the inflation
in the first place.
You know, you had a central bank that could thought it could ease more than it could.
We had average inflation targeting and all that sort of stuff.
So you had like the a priori conditions for high inflation and then you had some quote
unquote bad luck in the seventies.
It was, well, the next and close the gold window.
So the Fed can't control that.
Then you had the Yom Kippur war and then at the end of the decade you had the Iranian
revolution.
This time round, you know, we had a pandemic, which obviously didn't help.
And then we had the Ukraine war as well, which also didn't help.
And they're kind of like, they would often, they would cause inflation on their own, but
cause we already had the a priori conditions, like the kindling to some extent just needed
to be lit and it got lit.
But what happened in the seventies is we had a recession.
And essentially the Fed cup, and it was the, you know, what I call the premature all clear.
So the second act of the inflation play, it's a three act play.
And the second act was the premature all clear where they cut rates.
But then what they, what happened is inflation made a higher low and then start to climb
again.
And what I I'm looking at right now, people, you know, it seems to be, most people seem
to think this is like Goldman called it the last mile of disinflation and things like
that.
But the consensus is that inflation is kind of done.
It will head back to sort of maybe two and a half.
And that's kind of really it.
And it's unlikely to reaccelerate, but I think you look at a number of things that are already
beginning to turn up.
Simplistically, I'll give you one example.
You can separate all the components of inflation, US inflation, this is into structural and
cyclical components.
So the structural components are ones that are persistently above their longterm average
and the cyclical ones are anything that isn't, that doesn't conform to that.
And almost all of the decline in headline inflation has been driven by a decline in
the cyclical components.
The structural stuff has remained elevated, it's fallen a little bit, but what's happening
now is the cyclical has probably stopped falling, it might fall a little bit more.
The structural is still elevated, but the structural still started, it started to turn
up again.
So we're starting to see a rise in the structural and the cyclical has fallen so far that, and
as its name would suggest, it's cyclical.
So the cyclical will start to turn up, driven by things like gas prices or whatever it might
be.
And then they'll start reinforcing one another again.
And so you'll see this similar dynamic when inflation might fall a bit further, but then
it will start to pick up again.
And to be clear, I'm not saying we're going to get new highs, we're not going to necessarily
eclipse 9% again in headline, but it's going to be enough that it's going to cause alarm
and it's going to upset people because they're not expecting it.
You know, the CPI fixing swap market, which is your actual tradable way of knowing what
the market expects, is looking at inflation going back roughly two and a half within a
year's time.
So I think people are going to be unseated by this re-acceleration of inflation and the
market is just completely not priced for it.
OK.
And right there, you're talking about monetary inflation or capital flows driven inflation.
But the week we're talking here, rebels in the Red Sea have just started attacking shipping
lanes there through the Suez Canal.
And all of a sudden, 12% of global transport goes through the Suez Canal.
That's all now being redirected.
We don't know how long it's going to last for, whether the situation might even get
worse from here.
Who knows?
But all we know is that if they're getting redirected around Africa, that adds I think
like a 40% more in terms of time and costs and oil burned and all that stuff to the price
of getting something that used to be shipped through that route.
So that's inflationary, right?
How inflationary it's going to be, we don't know.
My point is just as there are sort of wildcards in this game that can add to that that the
Fed has zero control over.
Well, if you go actually on slide five, you just reminded me I had a chart.
So two charts there, for instance, that tell you things are now reversing, but maybe seeing
the most of the disinflationary kind of trend.
So the chart on the left side of slide five shows wages and wages leading indicators.
Just as one example, have started to rise again.
And that's corroborated, as I mentioned earlier, by the NFIB compensation plans, which also
leads wages that has started to pick up again.
And then relating directly to your Red Sea point, which I mentioned on the slide, funnily
enough, as the supply chain index started to pick up a while ago.
So obviously, it collapsed, but now as everything does, especially after a large collapse, we
expect to see some sort of bounce.
So we're seeing a bounce in supply chain index, which suggests that, again, we're past the
peak disinflationary advantage we've had from supply chain.
And then all it takes, something like the Red Sea, and we know that supply chains are
more fragile and more brittle now because of the geopolitical situation.
And again, the '70s was kind of similar in that extent as well, that we had a lot more
geopolitical uncertainty.
So if you already have the day priority, the sort of remote cause, if you like, of bad
inflation conditions, it just takes, as I say, bad luck, whatever you want to call it,
but unexpected things to happen.
And all of a sudden, something on its own, say 15 years ago, may not have been particularly
inflationary.
Or if it was, it would have been very briefly inflationary, now has the capacity to be considerably
more inflationary and cause a lot more issues.
So to think that the all clear has been sounded, I think, is way too premature on inflation.
And what the Fed has just done, I think, has just doubled that down.
They have just, as you said, given a green light to the wealth effects, animal spirits,
huge inflows into equities, all the kind of things that they said they had problems with
before, like financial conditions being too loose, well, it's just going to get even looser,
all these things raise the risk, significantly raise the risk for inflation.
So I think that's something that happens probably as early as I say later in next year and something
that the market really is not priced for at all.
Okay.
And what's your level of concern that we do start hitting those lag effects due to the
higher rates that we have had for the past two years, right at the time that inflation
might be really starting to bite again.
And so right at the time the Fed needs to use its tools to bring rates down, it can't.
Yeah.
I guess the question is, does the Fed cut rates this year?
Well, given how the market is kind of gunning for a March cut, 80%, I mean, the Fed has
always tried to disabuse the market of that has been too premature, but it shows you the
direction we're going in, right?
And the reaction function of the Fed has changed.
So I would have said to you initially before what happened last week, we're going to get
the next move will be a hike.
But now I think it's clear, as I say, there's another agenda, there's another reaction function.
So I think that they could push for a cut sooner than other things would justify.
And that may come before really, it's clear that inflation is picking up.
And then they're in a bit of a quandary.
Because they really have taken a gamble that inflation is kind of like it's done.
I mean, unless they're just being gung ho or you know what, the interest rate bill is
the biggest risk is a bigger risk for us.
I can't imagine that.
That's what I wanted to ask, which is asking for your gut feel here, right?
We don't know.
We're speculating.
But that they, as Powell seemed to intimate, we're winning this war.
We're not going to clear the victory just yet.
But we can see the beginning of the end here.
We don't want to wait until we get down to 2% to start cutting because then the lag effect
would drag us substantially below our inflation target.
We got to start cutting at some point above 2%.
We think we're getting close to that point.
And it's very much like, yeah, we're just kind of wrapping this up now.
Is it more that in their mind, do you think?
Or as some are asking, is the Fed really worried about something that's not telling us about?
Now it could be they could be worried about the budget, the cost of the interest service
on the debt.
I don't know.
It doesn't sound like you think that's a big enough bugbear for them.
But could there be something they see on the horizon that does worry them?
And they're thinking, we got to get ahead of this thing.
Yeah, well, to be clear, I think it could well be the interest burden.
I think that is on its own to have perhaps influenced them to act because, again, it's
so abrupt.
I've never subscribed to the sort of thing the Fed knows something that everyone else
doesn't in terms of the economy.
I mean, I'm sure they get access to some data that normal punters don't see, but they've
never really often behave in a way that's completely antithetical to what people expect.
That would suggest that they constantly-- they always have information that other people
aren't privy to.
So I don't necessarily think that-- there's a lot of speculation that could be politically
motivated in an election year or next year.
Of course, that would make sense, but we'll never know.
And I think it's kind of like-- there's not much point in speculating in that I think
follow the money.
And at the end of the day, politics is driven by what the economy is going to do and ultimately
what markets are doing.
And that's kind of driven by liquidity.
So I think if you follow the money, you'll manage to get most of the motivations you
need to.
Following the money tells me that if they didn't do anything and they allow interest
rates to keep rising-- and remember, by the time-- what really kind of unnerved them was
term premiums started rising.
And so basically, longer term yields started to rise, even though they weren't dependent
on the front end.
So the curve steepened, bear steepened, and term premiums started to rise.
And they obviously brought that up.
And so therefore, that really is a problem for the government's borrowing bill and therefore
for liquidity and therefore for financial stability, especially, by the way, as it relates
to funding markets.
So we had that little flare up in the SOFR rate a couple of weeks ago.
That's something they really want to avoid too because if we have a blow up in the funding
markets, which is caused by too few reserves, that's a major issue because that really kicks
in financial stability and markets and causes a lot of problems.
All these things, I think, are definitely concerns.
And having that interest rate bill ballooning-- and it really was ballooning-- is something
they could do something about by lowering long end yields.
And they took a punt, obviously, that they think inflation is not going to be an issue.
OK.
So back to liquidity being your point about following the money, what is your liquidity
outlook for next year?
Right now, excess liquidity is one of the things I follow now.
That looked as if it might start to roll over.
So one of the few things that sort of leads excess liquidity itself-- excess liquidity
tends to lead stuff.
If you look at annual returns of risk assets, like stocks, oil, things like that, excess
liquidity tends to lead it based on the arguments I made before about it being liquidity that's
excess and tends to find its way into assets.
But the real yield curve tends to lead excess liquidity.
Now, that looked like it started to roll over, as in it started to steepen, but the Fed's
actions have now just caused the reversal on that.
So I think the excess liquidity was on the cusp of declining and beginning to decline.
And that would sort of overall make liquidity conditions less conducive, less friendly for
risk assets.
But the Fed's pivot has just kind of reversed that.
So the dollar has weakened again.
And I think that's really-- as I say, that's been a big positive for liquidity conditions
this year.
It had started to rally quite recently, but the Fed's reversal has caused it to decline
again.
So all systems are kind of green for now.
That could change in a few months, but the outlook for the next few months, I think,
is liquidity tailwinds, and it will continue to mean that risk assets-- it's kind of hard
for them to go down.
It's not necessarily like they can't go down.
Of course, they can go down if something happens, but you have this kind of support.
And with that support, it's kind of hard for them to really sell off a huge amount, and
they'll just grind higher in the absence of anything negative.
All right, well, let me share that I interviewed Felix Zulauf two weeks ago or so, and this
was pre the Fed's surprise.
And his outlook, he said, look, I think asset prices are going to continue rallying from
here all the way through Q1, and the economy is going to look stronger to folks, and we're
going to get this narrative of the Fed's achieved the impossible.
We have the no landing scenario.
Everything is great again.
Everybody's making lots of money in the markets again.
And then he sort of sees the wheels coming off, and the market, the S&P, potentially
from whatever new high it's trading at at the end of Q1, could go down by as much as
40%.
He's not saying that's going to happen, but he's just saying the potential is there.
I know you've got concerns about the second half of the year economically.
How does that potential trajectory seem to you, given your outlook for markets right
now?
Do you see a similar kind of up and down?
Do you see something different?
So the endogenously, like obviously exogenously, if something happens, and looking at the market
itself, as I say, I think the biggest risk, like it's not black swan, of course, it's
known, unknown, but inflation coming back.
And I think that that might take the second half of the year before you've got a chance
of seeing that.
And that would cause the Fed's reaction function to change, because say its reaction function
is now changed again.
So you can, you know, I think what applied a couple of weeks ago doesn't necessarily
apply now.
And I think they are more gung ho about allowing kind of animal spirits to reign for the time
being, as long as they think inflation is not returning.
So that will keep the game in play for now.
So I wouldn't think Q1, I don't see, there's nothing I'm looking at to tell me Q1, but
there are stuff, things I'm looking at that maybe tells me Q3 or Q4 for that sort of dynamic
to take place, because as I say, as long as liquidity conditions are as they are right
now, and as I say, the power pivot has bought more time, then that should keep risk assets
kind of, they're not necessarily going to fly higher, but they really just have got
such a friendly tailwind, that it means that the, you know, as I say, unless you have anything
particularly negative happening from another angle, they should keep grinding higher.
The other kind of endogenous risk, but you know, an unknown if you like, would be something
happening in credit markets.
So credit markets have been another thing that's benefited from, you know, this kind
of like easier financial conditions, they're part of financial conditions, of course, but
you know, the general kind of like good liquidity backdrop from reserves, you know, credit spreads
have kept coming in, even though, you know, credit fundamentals have been deteriorating,
charge off rates have been rising, banks have been tightening lending standards, all the
usual things that tend to lead to credit cycle have been deteriorating.
Some of them have actually started to turn back up a little bit.
But I think, you know, if you look at, as I say, the underlying stuff, bankruptcy filings,
for instance, were rising, you know, these are things I think we've got to watch for
that suggests that maybe credit spreads are not necessarily reflective of the true health
of the credit market.
And then you've got to add in the opacity of the private credit market to, you know,
that's not massive, it's like one and a half trillion dollars in the US.
There, we don't have price discovery.
So that think that I, you know, would be a little bit wary of making any predictions
about a market that's even more opaque than it than it maybe was before.
And so if you had something happening in credit, and the thing is about credit is the in terms
of feeding through to the economy, like markets and economy kind of feed off on another you
try it, you get recessions, basically, when you get negative feedback loops between markets
and the economy.
So, you know, the economy maybe shows that it's getting weaker, markets respond to that.
So markets get weaker, but then that feeds back into the economy, and the economy gets
weaker again, and you have a negative feedback loop, and if it cascades past a certain point,
you tend to get recession.
But the high, the thing that's the biggest accelerant of that, if you like, is credit
spread.
So the sort of strongest link between the economy and market.
So that's why I'm concerned about something happening in credit markets, because I think
that could quickly take us into recessionary territory, other than, as I say, other exogenous
things.
All right.
And what do you think are the biggest risks that could manifest in trouble in the credit
market?
Is it the lag effect where we just have the longer we have rates high relative to where
they were a few years back?
We just start seeing more participants start to struggle, either because corporate balance
sheets rerate or whatever.
Yeah.
I mean, there's the growing interest rate burden.
So as we have the chart earlier, they've kind of, in the aggregate, benefited so far.
So that will start to bite.
So is that reversal?
Yeah, that you talked about.
Yeah, that reversal.
There's the, what you alluded to, there's the maturity wall.
So that will incrementally have more of an issue as they have to roll over the debt.
And as I say, I think what's happening in private credit markets, there's all kinds
of stuff that sounds crazy to me.
I'm sure it makes sense if you're in the market, but nav loans and using insurance premiums
to lend to people.
And we know that credit, whenever you see a swelling in credit, whether it's bank credit
or private credit or the credit markets, it's very hard to make a lot of loans quickly without
some of these loans being bad loans, lending to the wrong people.
Before the pandemic and stuff, they had all the covenant light loans, everything that's
kind of orientated around the borrower, not the lender.
And that just creates overall bad lending and lending that's likely to sour.
And if there's too much of it, obviously it can create an issue that can mushroom pretty
quickly.
Yeah, I have sort of concerns there.
I just don't necessarily credit spreads on their own are really as reflective of the
true health of the credit market as perhaps they once were.
Got it.
Got it.
And when you talk about problems mushrooming too, it's important to remind folks that there's
counterparty risk in credit markets.
And especially when there's greater opacity, like there isn't private credit, like you
said, sometimes there's a player that goes down that you don't realize the dominoes that
that one failure begins to set off.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And as I say that, and it very quickly feeds into the economy.
And you have a situation where you have like what looks like a fairly kind of stable economy,
like growing.
Okay.
Can very quickly go south.
And that's often what happens in recessions.
They don't happen gradually.
They happen suddenly.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, look, I could keep going for hours longer here, Simon, and there's lots of questions
I didn't get to, which means we're just going to have to have you back on in early 2024.
And hopefully you'll have a little bit more data by then to sort of see where you think
the year may be going.
But given your current outlook, which again, I'll just sort of summarize and feel free
to correct it, is lots of tailwind right now at the market sales, at least for the next
couple of months or so.
And then you get more worried as the year goes on, certainly back after the year, it
definitely has some pretty stiff challenges that could turn into market headwinds.
What assets right now do you think will fare well?
I mean, it seems like all assets pretty much are doing well right now.
Are we going to have all assets do well up until the momentum stops and then looking
for your second half of the year?
How would you consider folks or think folks should consider positioning given what could
happen then?
Yeah, that's a good question.
I mean, I think to some extent, yeah, I think we're back in kind of everything rally territory.
The things that maybe you want to look at now are the things that aren't participating.
And unless you can find a really good reason as to why they're not, they might be good
candidates.
But potentially oil, I mean, oil is thus far not really participated much, but as the Red
Sea thing has just reminded us that there's constant risks to oil.
People have been very negative on it for a while.
So these sort of things, whereas it's kind of hard to buy the S&P at all time highs.
That's not to say, of course, like it goes through an all time high and there's FOMO
kicks in and it keeps on rallying, but it depends how you want to trade.
I mean, some people don't mind that other people just hate buying at the highs.
It just feels, you know, it feels like it's too risky.
So but I think you broadly characterized it right in terms of, you know, another laggard,
by the way, is EM.
And I guess that's been held back by by China.
You know, China, again, is another one.
I mean, next sentiment is so negative.
You know, there's probably a lot of bad news already in the price.
You know, unless you think China's going to have a deflationary bust.
Some people do.
You know, I just don't think we're quite there yet.
And so at some point, I think, you know, the risk reward in something like China equity
starts to look good.
And they're, by the way, pumping liquidity in the system at an ever increasing rate.
If you look at net injections from the PBOC, they're on a 12 month basis, they're at like
multi year highs.
So you know, they are incrementally easing more and more and more behind the scenes,
plus all the other targets, it's kind of stimulus that they're adding.
So China, I think at some point, I think next year, we'll recover.
And then the second half of the year, yeah, I think the things that you are looking to
kind of either get rid of or short are things that obviously have gone up the most, but
I'd say, because I think inflation is going to come back, I think anything that looks
like it's this duration risk, you know, again, the market traded kind of the inflation risk
thing at the very beginning, like in, I think, late 2021, you know, when inflation was rising
or 2021, people were shunning kind of tech shares, and sort of looking at lower duration
stocks like utilities.
So really, it kind of that point, it kind of made a lot sense.
But then, you know, I guess the end of 2022, especially when chat GPT three and a half
was released, that all got jettisoned, and it became like, just grab for duration.
And obviously, inflation is not going to be an issue.
So you know, who cares?
So I think then that that could reverse again, you know, I think people might start to be
if it looks like inflation is coming back, and no one's ready for it.
People might start to reevaluate their attitude to duration again, not just in stocks, obviously,
and fixed income.
Yeah, exactly.
All right.
Fantastic.
Thank you so much, Simon.
This has been a just a wonderful discussion.
Thanks for giving us so much of your time.
I've got two more questions for you.
The second one, which we'll end with is going to be we've been talking about monetary and
financially related issues this whole hour.
You just gave us a good sense of assets to go investigate given the potential outlook
of how things could happen next year.
But is there a non-financial investment that you would encourage people to consider adopting
in their lives no matter how much money they might have in their portfolio a lot or a little?
Before I get to that question, though, very important question for folks that have really
enjoyed this discussion, maybe this is their first time meeting you virtually and would
like to follow you and your work.
How can they do that?
So I write on Bloomberg.
So I'm a macro strategist on Bloomberg.
So I have a column called macroscope, which you can find on the Bloomberg terminal.
And also I write for the Markets Live blog.
So it's a 24-hour kind of scroll of market news, lots of contributors.
And that also is on the terminal, too.
So they're the best places to find my writing.
OK, great.
When I edit this, Simon, I will put up links to those or the URLs for those on the screen.
Folks, I'll put links down in the description below the video, too.
And also, too, if you just go to the internet and just search Simon White Bloomberg, you'll
get a lot of news coverage of a lot of Simon's analysis where a lot of journalists are reading
his reports and then sort of incorporating them into their writing.
So fantastic.
All right.
Well, really quickly and just wrapping up here, a quick housekeeping before we get to
our last question.
One, if you've enjoyed meeting Simon here, we'd like to have him come on in early 2024
and give us an update to his outlook.
Please encourage him to do that by hitting the like button, then clicking on the red
subscribe button below, as well as that little bell icon and just a reminder while this new
Thoughtful Money channel is still in its infancy, the growth in our subscribers on this channel
really does make a big difference in getting the YouTube algorithm to pick us up.
So it's totally free to subscribe if you can do that.
That is great.
Secondly, just want to remind folks that I am now resumed publishing my Adam's notes,
which are my cliff notes summaries to these interviews.
If you want to get all the ones that I've done for every expert that I've interviewed
on this channel so far, plus my one from this interview here with Simon.
Just go to my sub stack, adamtagert.substack.com.
I have a lot of information there for free, though, to get the notes, you have to subscribe
for the premium service, which is still pretty darn cheap.
It's still going to be $8 a month through the end of this month.
So if you're interested in getting them, get them soon before the price goes up.
And then last, we're at this question, Simon, what's a non-financial investment you'd encourage
folks to consider?
Something I've done in the past and then I've neglected recently, but I think it's even
more appropriate now is learn as much as you can about programming and about AI.
Because it's obviously, it's a cliche, but it is the future.
But there's a book I read by a guy called Douglas Rushkoff a few years ago, it's called
Program or Be Programmed.
And I think that really captures exactly the sentiment here is that if, I guess, you don't
know about exactly what's happening, is you essentially allow your life to be directed
by tech.
Or if you don't, it means you allow your life to be directed by others who've mastered tech
or tech itself.
One choice, the first one, you get access to the control panel of your life.
And the second one, I think, maybe one of the last proper decisions that you ever make.
So I think it's so important now, just not to be a consumer of tech, to actually have
some inkling about what is happening behind it, so that you have some autonomy left, because
I think it's just going to get more and more confusing.
And the more confusing it, the less you know about it, the more confusing it will be.
So that would be my suggestion for a non-financial investment.
That is a fantastic answer.
I love this question.
Simon is getting so many great answers that I never would have predicted, but this is
truly just almost an essential one, I think, given the new era that we're entering into.
So Simon and folks watching, I will put a link down to Douglas Riskov's book in the
description as well.
So if you want to go check that out, you can do that at just one click.
It's very short as well.
It's pretty short.
Okay, good.
All right.
Well, look, Simon again, thank you so much.
Really appreciate you coming on.
It's been even better than I'd hoped it was going to be.
So thank you so much.
The door is always open here to come back on this channel when you have an important
shift in your outlook.
But hopefully at the latest, we'll get you back in early 2024 for that.
Folks, if you want to continue to investigate the topic of liquidity, which is central to
how Simon sees the world, if you did not see the Michael Howell video, I'll put up a link
to it right here.
And if you still got some stamina, you can go watch that one.
Simon again, thank you so much.
