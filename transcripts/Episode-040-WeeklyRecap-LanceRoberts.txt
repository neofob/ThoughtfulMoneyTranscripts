Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart,
welcoming you back here at the end of another week
for a weekly market recap,
featuring my good and vertical friend, Lance Roberts.
Lance, that was vertical with a D.
I'm going to assume,
perhaps you and not everybody watching doesn't necessarily,
not everybody knows what that word means.
It means truthful, like veritas.
So anyways, you're a guy who's a straight shooter,
doesn't mince words.
I thought vertical was pretty appropriate
for you this week.
- See, I thought she meant vertical with a V
'cause after getting ready for this conference this weekend,
I've been working late.
So it's surprising I'm vertical today.
- Yeah, I think next week
you're going to be my horizontal friend, Lance Roberts.
- Correct, that will absolutely be the case.
But yeah. - And speaking of which,
as we're talking here on this video
and folks are watching it probably on Saturday morning,
we are at your event in Houston.
- That is correct.
So yeah, very excited today
to be talking to a fairly large group of people
and just talking about the economy, the outlook.
Greg Valliere today, who is a political commentator
talking about the presidential election cycle,
what to expect from this election,
so how it's going to affect the market.
So yeah, very excited about it.
It's going to be a very interesting day.
- Okay, so on the day you and I are talking, Lance,
we've had five consecutive all-time highs in the S&P.
TBD if Friday is going to close
at another all-time high or not.
Real quick, just want to give a quick preview
for something I'll talk about at the end of this discussion.
So we're at your conference right now
as folks are watching this.
I have not only locked in the date for my conference,
but now tickets are on sale for it at the early bird price.
So I'm going to give everybody all that information
at the end of this video.
And also just very happy to announce,
as we talked about last week
that I had passed my securities exam,
I am now able to officially start referring people
to our endorsed financial advisors like your firm, Lance.
And so thoughtfulmoney.com, folks,
I'll give you all the details on that
at the end of this video,
but wanted to give a little advanced celebration here.
It's so nice to have that up and running again.
All right, Lance, like I said,
five consecutive all-time highs in the S&P here.
Tell us what's going on.
Maybe we want to pull up the S&P chart
that we normally view each week.
My key question for you is,
are we entering into overbought territory here
with these consecutive all-time highs
or are we still sort of staying in that band?
- No, no, no, we are definitely not.
Let me get to a share screen here.
Yeah, no, definitely not in that band anymore.
We were in this band back in mid-December
and early January, broke out of that decisively.
And early January,
we've been kind of ratcheting up ever since then.
We're back on a MACD buy signal.
And so there's a couple of interesting things
that are going on.
So first of all, this breakout to new highs
and we consolidated for a very long period.
And from that consolidation process,
you would expect that the market's going to move up or down
and break out of that channel.
And so we broke out to the upside.
So that's good news.
The bulls remain very intact.
However, we are back to overbought conditions,
but we're also on a MACD.
If you look at the top part of this chart,
we're back onto a MACD buy signal.
So this buy signal, this little highlighted circle
is back intact.
Now, just because we're in a buy signal
doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to take off
running to the races higher.
We're going to go up 10% from here or whatever.
I mean, anything's certainly possible,
but kind of as is always the case,
when these indicators are flipping back and forth
at a fairly high level,
price advances continue to be contained somewhat.
So again, if we look back to June of last year
as a good example of this,
we were at a fairly high level on the MACD like we are now.
So very similar type of setup.
Trigger to sell signal,
the market kind of flopped around for about a month or so,
kind of grinded higher, but ultimately really
didn't go anywhere.
Slipped back to a MACD buy signal in about mid-July,
flipped back to that buy signal,
about the same level that we're at now,
and the market rallied through the end of the month,
and then that was it.
And then we had that 10% correction.
So it's not unusual for the market to be doing here
what it's doing.
Very similar to what we saw since November,
December, halfway through January now
has been a very strong advance.
This is what we call a bull stampede or a bullish stampede.
So you kind of think about a stampede of bulls, right?
They're all just running in one direction.
That's what's going on right now.
We've got this bullish stampede going on,
which means you have minimal drawdowns and lots of updates.
So the market just kind of grinds higher
and it just kind of keeps moving higher.
Investors are going, I don't understand what's going on here.
This market's just never going to go down again.
But that's that bullish stampede.
Then conversely, what will ultimately happen
is at some point we'll get a bear stampede.
And this is where investors will go,
I just don't understand why this market won't stop going down
and we go through these from time to time.
Normally these stampedes last 15 to 20 trading days,
but they do occasionally last longer.
We've had two very long advances just since last year,
March, April, May, June, July of last year,
and now in November, December, January of this year.
These are very long kind of advances
for these bullish stampedes.
But consequently, you're eventually going to get
this bearish stampede that investors are going to start
talking about, oh, the bear market's back.
This market's never going to stop going down anymore.
It's all over.
And this is just how market psychology works.
This is why it's really important not to get trapped up
into these narratives about markets.
Nothing's going to bring this market down.
It's just going to go up forever.
You're eventually going to get selling pressure
because simply you get an imbalance of buyers and sellers.
And at some point, all the people that will have wanted
to buy stocks will have bought them.
And those that have sold,
they've been selling all the way.
And they're basically out of stuff to sell
for the most part.
And then you get this reversion
'cause now the buyers will want to start selling
and the sellers will start buying again.
So that's just how markets work over time.
Understand the dynamics certainly helps a lot
to kind of navigate the psychological side of this.
But nonetheless, to your point, we are very overbought here.
And that's going to limit upside.
Doesn't mean markets can't go up
a little bit further from here.
They certainly can.
But again, just be aware that we're pretty stretched.
Same thing holds true.
If we look at the volatility index versus the S&P 500,
let me change this to a line
so it's a little bit easier to see.
Well, daily volatility messes that up.
So here, let's just look at this.
So if you take a look at the volatility index,
we're pigging down.
I mean, we're at basically about 13 on the VIX.
Very, very low levels.
And normally when markets are screeching higher
like they're doing now and you have very low volatility,
this is a point in time where nobody's convinced
the market's going to come down again.
So why buy puts?
That typically tends to be kind of an inflection point
to where you start getting some type of correction
in the markets.
It doesn't mean the market's going to crash.
It doesn't mean anything like that.
It just means you're going to get a pullback in the markets
to give you a better opportunity
to add some exposure to portfolios.
And so again, just have to kind of navigate that
for what it is and just understand this.
Now, one last chart here, then I'll throw it back to you.
- Hey, real quick, before you,
you just left that chart.
So that was a two-year chart in volatility.
You had that?
- Yeah, it was about two years.
Put that back up.
- I mean, I guess we're back up in the thirteens here.
We were down in the twelves not that long ago,
but I just want to note here
that volatility is more compressed or subdued
than it has been in at least two years here, right?
- Yeah, no, we're plumbing kind of all-time lows
for volatility.
I mean, normally we used to bottom around 15.
That was a very low level of volatility.
Now we're doing 12 to 13.
So yeah, we've really, really,
ever since the October, 2022 bottom,
where we were talking about then,
of course you'll remember back then, October of 22,
everybody's like, it's a recession's here
and the housing market's going to crash.
We're de-dollarizing, rates are going to go to the moon.
And everything was so negative.
We said, hey, this is a really great setup for the markets
because you have such negative sentiment
that's going to drive a bullish turn to the markets.
And we wrote a couple of articles about this
and other things.
Of course, everybody believed FANG stocks were dead
at that point as well.
But of course, since then, we've had this massive no rally.
A lot of it's driven by the FANG stocks in particular,
and that's just been compressing that volatility ever since.
And we've just compressed volatility
to basically nothing at this point.
And which is, again, like I said,
that's just a really good,
when you have that kind of compressed volatility,
it's like a spring, it wants,
volatility wants to go higher.
It's just a function of what triggers it.
- All right, Lance, well, look,
I think one of the questions
that's increasingly getting asked now is,
is there a potential for a melt up here?
We've got this bullish stampede.
We've got companies coming out of their buyback window.
We've got good macro news.
We'll talk in a moment about the five sigma beat
on the GDP number for Q4.
And tied to that is this narrative,
which I know you've got something to say on
'cause you just wrote a piece about it, huge surprise,
which is that there's all this money on the sidelines,
all these trillions that have moved their way
into money market funds.
And now that there's a party going on in stocks
and that the Fed might be cutting rates,
all that cash is gonna slosh into the stock market
and start driving stocks higher.
So what's your thought here on this sort of market melt up?
I'm not saying crack up boom
because that's a different phenomenon.
And there are other people beginning to talk about that too,
but let's stick with the melt up potential here.
What do you think?
- Well, no, I mean, look, markets are doing exactly
what you would expect them to do.
And again, we had spent two years going nowhere.
So theoretically, January 22 to January 24,
the market's return was zero.
So we just spent last year getting back to even.
So in a market melt up,
this is where you're just gyrating higher,
absolutely nothing out there is able to stop the market.
It certainly seems that way right now,
but look, economic growth is good.
We just saw a PCE come in today
with personal spending at 0.7.
The expectations were 0.4.
Personal incomes were in line at 0.3.
GDP growth at 3.3%.
There's some things going on with GDP numbers.
But again, like you said, GDP is fine.
Unemployment's low, unemployment rate is low.
You know, there's really nothing here
to concern the bulls, so to speak, in terms of the market.
And we're not making 1% advances every day.
The market's grinding higher,
but we just spent a month and a half consolidating range.
And so technically the markets are behaving
actually very normally.
I mean, yeah, there's no volatility right now.
Markets aren't jumping up and down.
We're not having 2% up days and 2% down days,
that type of thing.
But there's nothing here that really suggests
you're having a big melt up in the market.
Now there's some stocks that we can certainly talk about.
Nvidia, AMD, some of the AI stocks,
they have certainly gone parabolic here.
Over the course of the last couple of weeks in particular,
Nvidia as an example is up 20% this year.
We added Nvidia back, I think in November of last year.
And you know, it's up 20% in two weeks.
So, you know, that's the type of thing
you don't like to see as an investor,
because these very outsized gains
are gonna have to give up here a bit.
You know, Eli Lilly, which we've added to the portfolio,
that's doing very well.
AMD, you know, since we bought AMD in late '23,
it's up like 74%.
So, you know, those type of stocks
are just a little bit, you know, well ahead of themselves.
So we took some profits in AMD on Friday, Thursday.
And again, when that stock pulls back,
we'll rebalance the portfolio, buy some shares back,
because the thesis behind those stocks is still very strong.
But you know, the overall market,
there's a lot of weakness.
If you know, if we were looking at this market and saying,
man, just everything is going up,
it's not really the case.
The market is going up
because of really a handful of stocks.
We're right, and this is something
that we're talking about today, right now.
This is something we're talking about
in my presentation today,
is we're back to the MAGA 7,
actually, it's the magnificent 6 now.
- I was gonna mention that, yeah, so go on with that,
'cause we've got one that's kind of beginning
to fall out of that.
- Yeah, and it's really when you really nail it
and drill down into it, it's really two stocks.
It's Nvidia and Meta, or Facebook.
So those are really the two driving the market.
But again, you know, they make up 35% of the market.
And so if you take a look at the advances
in the S&P versus the Equal Weight Index,
there's a big disparity again.
A vast majority of the market
is not going up with the market.
Healthcare is lagging this year, underperforming,
with the exception of Eli Lilly.
You know, utilities, real estate, those stocks,
a lot, you remember at the end of last year,
we had that very strong advance,
really kind of that broad advance.
Small caps are doing great, mid caps are doing awesome.
They've all kind of given up the ghost this year.
We're back to that very narrow advance,
which, you know, certainly provides some concern
about that group of stocks.
But as far as the market itself being very overbought,
it's kind of an illusion of a very small handful of stocks.
If you really want to understand
what's going on with the market,
look at the Equal Weight Index.
It's a much better indicator about what the market is doing
and whether or not there's actual meltdown.
- Okay, and so we referenced one of the companies
of the Mag7 starting to struggle, that's Tesla.
And, you know, so Tesla had been a real bellwether
for years, right?
It was the unstoppable company, right?
That's beginning to struggle.
We're also beginning to see some surprises
from some companies that are pretty good bellwethers
for the economy.
And, you know, these are disappointing surprises
and their stocks are getting hammered for it.
One I'm thinking of right here is Intel, right?
They just disappointed yesterday, I think right now,
when we're talking to the stocks down like 10%.
So, you know, to your point, like,
it doesn't seem like a broad-based rally here necessarily.
And it seems like, in fact, some important companies
that have done a lot of water carrying over past years
are starting to stumble.
- That's right.
And again, this is, you know, as an example,
you know, Intel is just, you know, has, you know,
bad guidance.
These really can't seem to get out of their way
in a lot of cases.
You know, it's the same thing for Humana.
Humana is down like 30% in two days this week
on bad guidance about what's happening
in the insurance carrier space.
So, you know, it's definitely a stock-by-stock basis.
You can have a portfolio of stocks and do nothing right now
because you don't own the right stocks.
And you may look at your portfolio,
"Man, the market's going up every day.
My portfolio is not doing anything, why?"
It's 'cause you don't own all the right stocks.
You've got to own those seven stocks, unfortunately,
to have that kind of, and there's other stocks.
I shouldn't say it's just seven,
but, you know, you can take a look at Broadcom.
You can take a look at Salesforce, CRM.
There's a variety of other companies
in kind of that tech space.
They're driving the market, flipping over to healthcare.
It's Eli Lilly, just that stock just has been unstoppable.
Take a look at, you know, kind of the defense sector.
You know, Raytheon had a bit of problems.
They've got themselves kind of straightened out.
That stock's been performing a lot better.
You know, there's just, you know,
and kind of going to each little sector,
there's, you know, there's one or two stocks
that are performing very, very well,
but a big swath of them are not.
And that's, and that's really the problem
with the overall market.
- All right.
You know, I realized we still have to get to your
kind of dismantling of the narrative of cash on the sidelines
that's going to potentially power melt up.
Real quick before we get there,
we are now beginning to enter earnings season, right?
That's why we're getting some of these news events
or, you know, conference calls
that are either popping stocks or dropping them.
What are earnings telling us right now?
'Cause you wrote a piece earlier this week
about the markets and where you said going forward,
you know, earnings are key to where this market's gonna go.
So what are we learning so far?
- That earnings are actually kind of disappointing.
So far, look, we haven't had that many companies report yet.
Now, by the time that we do this show next week,
we'll have a lot bigger sample of earnings in.
And then by the following Friday,
we'll have about 80% of the S&P 500 will report it.
So we're gonna have a really good indicator
about just how good this earnings season was.
But so far, very early in the season,
we're running about a negative 3.4% disappointment
relative to what estimates were.
So, you know, stocks aren't, you know,
and those earnings have been cut.
We wrote about the very drastic cut
to Q4 earnings estimates right at the end,
right at the beginning of this year.
And those estimates got cut by $8 over two months,
wrapping up the year.
So that bar was set really low,
and we're still missing that bar on a lot of fronts.
Guidance has also been weak on a lot of fronts.
Now, again, we still haven't gotten
to a lot of the bellwethers.
We haven't heard from Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia.
Those companies are later.
But so far, there's been a couple of companies
that have come out and had done really great.
They've had big pops,
and there's been a lot of disappointment.
Like I said, Humana is a good example of that.
So, you know, that drags down to other stocks and sectors
like United Healthcare.
So, you know, there's definitely knockoff effects.
- Okay, and how important is it going to be
in your estimation, you know, as companies announce,
they begin to get freed up to start doing buybacks again?
How big of a factor do you think
that's going to be this quarter?
- Well, you know, it was funny
because I said that back in October.
I wrote an article back in October.
I said, you know, October weakness will lead
to an end of the year rally for three reasons.
And the first reason was very negative sentiments,
which we had.
Second reason was that just kind of the end of the year,
there's portfolio positioning,
that type of thing that happens
that tends to drive the markets.
And it's, you know, basically have a rebalance portfolios.
A lot of managers were well underweight.
They were lagging performance, had to play catch up.
The third reason was buybacks.
And we were expecting 5 billion a day
in buybacks at that point.
And I got a bunch of blow back from you.
He was like, buybacks don't drive the market.
And I'm like, okay, whatever.
But you had a record amount of buybacks
in November and December,
which just sent this market racing through the roof.
And then those kind of ended
right towards the end of December,
went back into the blackout period.
That's where the market's been struggling.
That buyback window has started to open back up.
So as companies announce earnings,
they can start buying back shares.
Even companies like Nokia just announced
a $630 million buyback on their shares.
That's a very small company now.
It used to be huge, you know.
So, but that window's opening back up.
And once we get through Friday after next,
that window's gonna be pretty much open
and the buybacks will begin kind of in earnest again.
- All right.
You know, this is,
we've ranted about buybacks so many times,
but one element about it that just still sticks with me
is the decision to do a stock buyback in theory
is we, the management,
have looked across the universe of opportunities
for where we can invest our excess capital.
And we have determined of the entire universe
that our stock is so undervalued,
it's the best purchase to be made right now.
And what's so interesting
and why that's just such a fallacy
is because it always comes back to being,
each CFO says we've looked at the universe
and I've just determined it's my stock
that's the one that's undervalued, right?
They could be buying Apple,
they could be buying any other company.
But for some reason,
it's always their one particular stock
and we're gonna put all our 600 and whatever million
into that one stock.
We're not gonna diversify across.
So it's all just shenanigans
and it's all just that shell game
to make your EPS look better.
I mean, yes, there's some other reasons
if you're retiring, if you're buying it with debt,
let's say that's got a lower interest rate
than the dividends that you're replacing,
but those days are over 'cause debt's so high now.
- Right, but even those were done
to the benefit of the insider zone.
The SEC did an investigation
and found out that in every case,
buybacks are done for the benefit
of the insiders of the companies
'cause that's who sells back the stocks.
And this is one of the big fallacies about buybacks
that people always talk about is like,
it's a return of capital to shareholders.
Really?
I mean, did you get a check in the mail
when Apple bought back shares of Apple?
No, you did.
The only, did somebody call you and say,
hey, Adam, I wanna buy your shares back?
Nobody from Apple called you.
I mean, as an individual,
I can buy and sell shares of Apple every day on the market.
The only people that benefit from the share buybacks
are the insiders who are the ones selling their shares,
which are generally restricted back to the company.
And that's how they create these massive,
you know, this massive wealth of C-suite executives.
But it's not a return of capital to shareholders.
You got nothing from it.
And people say, well, the stock price went up.
Yeah, Apple did buybacks all during 2022
when the stock price was going down.
So that isn't a whole water either.
It's just a function.
And look, there's been plenty of studies.
It's a function to manipulate EPS
in order to meet Wall Street estimates.
The other 10% of the fudging comes from CFOs to beat EPS.
So that's all this comes down to.
- Right.
And, you know, to compensate many times richly
your executive staff, right?
Capital is going to shareholders.
It's just going to a very few
who are the inside top executives.
- And actually the correct statement, you know,
you made the statement, the right statement,
which is, you know,
we've looked around the whole universe of the world
and our stock is the only thing we're spending money on.
The actual, the reality, and you're right,
that's an absolute fallacy.
The reality though is,
is that what companies are saying by doing buybacks
is that I've looked all around the world
and I cannot find a single thing better to do with my money.
That I can generate as much benefit for myself
than buybacks right now.
I mean, think about all the money I could have used.
You know, Apple could have bought a new technology company
to, you know, do something to help them.
And, you know, go buy an AI company, you know,
go fund a big AI company.
The problem with that is, is that if I buy a company,
it may take years for that acquisition
to a neuro- - To generate the return.
- Exactly, so, and that takes too long.
I can just do a buyback, I can get it right now.
So, you know, the problem is, is that these buybacks,
and there was a reason why buybacks were illegal until 1990.
But, you know, the problem of this is,
and you know, the average American, you know,
we take their polls, they're upset about the economy.
I wrote an article about that earlier.
You know, you take a look at polls.
I mean, average Americans upset about the economy,
they're upset about the wealth gap,
they're upset about all this.
But this, buybacks are one of the big reasons
that contribute to that, because if companies
didn't have that option to do buybacks,
they would have to spend that capital making an acquisition,
building a plant, creating jobs, doing those type of things,
which would actually inure to the benefit
of a broader swath of Americans
and make the economy much more profitable.
- Well, I'm going to still stick to my prediction
that at some point in their lifetime,
buybacks will likely be illegal again,
and I will cheer that when it happens.
- Well, there will probably never be made illegal
because there's too many people on the political side
that benefit from it, but there will be an end to buybacks.
There will definitely be an end.
- Be an end, yeah, and I think-
- Because at some point, every company will go private,
so there won't be a word for that.
- So it's totally back.
- Yeah, I'll predict before then that there will be
some tight, tough times for the country,
and buybacks and the enrichment of the C-suite through them
is going to come into the public's crosshairs,
and it's going to become an election issue
at some point in time, and some politicians
going to use it as their way to get into office.
- Well, and again, the problem right now
is that before that can happen,
there has to be this realization that right now,
see, buybacks are treated as gold
because it's a return of capital shareholder.
It absolutely is not, but that's the lie
that's been perpetrated on the average American,
and so they think buybacks are a good thing,
and, "Oh, they're giving me money back."
No, they're not giving you a damn thing back.
- Right, but just remember, too, though,
93% of financial assets are owned
by only 10% of households, so a lot of,
you know, that means that the other 90% are saying,
like, "I'm not benefiting at all from this."
- This is a true statement.
So anyway, all right, let's not rain on that today.
- All right, well, okay, before I forget, though,
let's get to your point, though, about,
you know, well, why might not we see a melt-up here
because of these trillions in cash on the sidelines,
quote-unquote, flooding into stocks?
- So yeah, a couple of reasons.
So first of all, you know, there's this,
every time that we start having a, you know,
kind of a melt-up in the market or whatever,
this has been one that goes, "This is not a new thing,"
by the way, of the average, you know, person saying,
"Oh, it's the cash on the sidelines,
and we're gonna have all this."
But every time we get these big, you know, run-ups
and money market balances,
particularly last year in particular, you know,
there's this idea that all this money's gonna come
rushing back into the markets,
and that really never is the case.
And, you know, there's a couple of reasons for that.
So this is the increase in total money market funds
going back to 2011.
Obviously you see this big jump
during the pandemic shut down, the bank crisis, you know,
savings kind of went, you know,
this money market kind of went sideways for a while.
And then just recently has taken off, you know,
up again as we just had this big pile-in into this.
However, in order for money to be on the sidelines, right,
it's gotta come in and to come into the market,
then it's gotta be in somebody's investment cards, right?
So first of all, the first thing you have to remember is,
is that there really cannot be cash on the sidelines.
And the reason is, is that for every buyer of a stock,
there has to be a seller of a stock.
So think about it like a football team where I have 11,
I can have 300 players sitting on my benches,
but I can only have 11 players on the field.
And if I wanna swap out a player,
I've got to take one out and put one in, right?
I can't put 300 people on the field to win the game, right?
So it's just, that's not the way it works.
So for every buyer, there's a seller.
So the only difference is that you could have a trillion
dollars of money come into the market today,
and you'd have to have a trillion dollars worth of selling
on the other side so that trillion dollars
could buy something.
So there's always an equilibrium.
Now, the reason that people think that money will go,
that money will cause the market to go up
is that the market, as the market advances,
they go, "Oh, all this money's coming into the markets.
That's why market's going up."
No, we just have an imbalance of buyers and sellers.
And so right now, in order to buy something,
sellers are going, "Yeah, I'll sell you my Apple
or my Nvidia right now, but man,
you're gonna have to pay up for it.
And if you wanna buy it,
you're gonna have to buy it from me at this price."
So buyers are having to step up to find that.
So the only difference between the buying and the selling
is what price that transaction takes place.
So in theory, if we had a whole bunch of that money,
everybody woke up today and said,
"Hey, I'm buying the stock market today."
And everybody went and pulled all their savings
out of the bank and threw it to their money market account
and their brokerage account, and then went and bought stocks.
Yeah, it would push the stock price up today
because all of a sudden you had this rush of buyers
and it brought the equilibrium
of the transaction price higher.
But as soon as that rush of money is over,
prices are gonna come back down.
And because again, markets are gonna find their balance
and it's always an equilibrium of the buying and the selling.
But, so let's talk about where all the cash is, right?
So there's all this money sitting in money market accounts,
but where is it in terms of the market?
So if we take a look at the equity
to money market asset ratio,
it's come down a bit here since 20,
the peak of the market in 2022,
but it's still at the highest level.
In other words, there's a whole lot more equity ownership
than there is cash on the books across the board.
So, I mean, you're still a level higher
than we were at the peak of the market
and the bubbles and the dot-com crisis,
as well as 2008 financial crisis.
So not a lot of cash sitting there from that perspective.
Take a look at the American Association
of Retail Investors,
they're heavily allocated towards equities.
They've got 65% of their money in equities.
They've got another 30% or so in bonds.
They've got very little cash
sitting in their money market accounts.
If you're invested in the market right now
and you've got a whole lot of cash in your portfolio,
you're probably going, I'm not making any money.
I need to get to the market.
That's what retail investors have been doing for the last,
since October, 2022,
is piling that money back into the market.
So that's retail.
If we take a look at it a little bit different way,
if we take a look at the amount
of money market cash we have,
so this is the total amount of money market cash,
the 7 trillion,
as a function of the market capitalization,
there's not that much money there
relative to the market cap of the financial markets.
So- - That's interesting.
- You know, it's a very low...
Now, but interestingly,
look at the bottom of the market in 2009,
look at the money market to capitalization ratio
at that point and look at it at the dot-com crisis
and then, you know, in 1984,
we were kind of coming out of that whole
double back-to-back scenario with recessions and all that.
But you take a look at the dot-com bubble in 2008,
those were points where there was a lot of cash
relative to market capitalization,
which helped fuel the bull market.
So, you know, right now with where the markets are,
there's not a lot of support, okay?
But now let's talk about professionals.
If you take a look at mutual funds around there,
they have some of the lowest cash on record.
So there's not...
If you're looking for this massive amount of money
coming into the market, it's not in retail markets.
It's not in investment accounts.
It's not in an area that's going to flow into the markets.
Where is all that money?
- Hey, yeah, and real quick,
and you can answer this in your answer here,
is that a sign that the retail
and I guess maybe the institutional investor
is pretty fully invested?
- Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
- Okay.
- Most people that are invested in the markets
don't have a lot of cash sitting on here.
And again, there's another way to look at this.
So this is from the government office
that reports and, you know, tracks
all the money market account balances.
So this is prime money market, government tax exempt,
prime institutional government tax exempt retail,
prime retail, which is that little yellow band.
Prime retail is where your money,
that's the retail money market.
That big blue chunk that's there,
that kind of light blue,
that's the massive amount of the money that's there.
Those are institutional prime money market funds.
Those accounts are generally minimum
of a hundred thousand dollar account balance.
Lot of them are a million dollars
as a minimum account balance.
This is where, so now this is where institutions
and companies are holding their cash.
That cash that's used for operating expenses, payroll,
those types of issues where, you know,
you think about a company like Apple or Google or Meta
or Berkshire Hathaway that has 130 billion in cash on hand.
That's where that money is.
That's the money that's used for stock buybacks
and other stuff like that.
But that's not money that's gonna come flooding
into the retail, you know, kind of stock market positioning.
So again, most of that is for corporations
or high net worth individuals that is slated for other use,
not buying, you know, shares of a company in the market.
- Okay, so yeah.
I mean, you're kind of dismantling this expectation
that there's this, you know, tsunami of cash
that could just easily flood in here.
I liked your football team analogy.
Maybe just a more simple way for folks
to think about that though is I'm investor A,
Lance's investor B, Lance has a stock I wanna buy from him.
So my cash is in bank A and I take that cash
and I give it to Lance to buy his stock.
Lance then sells his stock, gives his stock to me, right?
'Cause I've just given him cash
and he has to put that cash somewhere.
So he puts it in bank B, right?
So the same amount of cash has stayed in the banking system.
It's not like it's gone and stayed in the market.
All that exchanged hands was the stock
at whatever price we transacted at.
But the cash itself was in the banking system
and then it went right back into the banking system.
- Exactly.
And we just wanted to focus on this one last chart here.
This is the four week change in share buybacks
versus the S&P 500.
I just want you to notice that ever since really 2000
and about '15, really going back,
if you say really 2009, it started to grow,
but you can just see how that range of transactions
has just expanded really since the financial crisis.
And that's where all that money's just been going
into stock buybacks ever since then.
And it's interesting, one of the last point
about money markets is that money markets,
if you take a look at this chart,
this chart goes back to 1974.
So this is money market total assets in millions,
back to 1974.
What's interesting about this is that the X,
if you just kind of drew a linear trend,
money markets have just been accumulating ever since 1974.
There's never a period where you see this massive drawdown
in money market accounts 'cause it went somewhere else,
it went to the markets or whatever.
It's just been accumulating
and it just continues to accumulate.
The more that we do debt-driven finance
and those types of things,
you have this expansion
of these money market account balances.
Ironically, when those balances are drawing down the most
is during the period you really don't want to be involved
in the markets, which is during the dot-com crash,
during the financial crisis,
that's when money's getting liquidated
and really quote-unquote effectively destroyed
during those financial crisis moments.
And even during the pandemic,
we saw money markets kind of flatline
and then started taking off again.
But this goes back to who is it
that's actually storing all this cash
and it's mostly companies.
It's just as companies have not a use for their cash,
they're just getting piled up in money market accounts.
- So Lance, I would assume that the correlation
between the accumulation of money market funds over time
and the money supply is probably pretty tight, is it?
Have you ever mapped it to?
- I haven't mapped it to,
but just kind of eyeballing it,
I would suggest, I would probably imagine
that the correlation would be decently high.
I'll do the work, I'll do the, I'll check it out.
- Okay, yeah, and it just might be in some way
sort of a soft proxy for money supply.
- Yeah.
- Okay, well, look, super interesting.
So much to get through, let's charge ahead
and see if we can get through it.
At least most of this list before I got to split
to the airport to go meet up with you there in Houston.
Okay, so we've got a Fed meeting coming up this week, right?
So Jerome Powell surprised everybody at the last one.
We'll see what happens this time around.
I'm gonna ask you in a second,
what, if anything, are you expecting to hear at this one?
I just want to give the context that former Fed chair,
Janet Yellen, was just interviewed recently
and she's, I don't know if she's foaming the software,
landing runway or whatever,
but she's trying to talk up the positive sentiment
that seems to be continuing to build here
with this bullish stampede.
She said that she thinks 2024 is going to be quote
a very good economic year.
She cites consumers and households feeling confident enough
about their own personal financial situation
and about the economic outlook to be spending in a way
that's creating jobs, creating growth,
and is providing them with the income to go on doing that.
And I don't see a reason why that can't continue.
So I might take some issue with something she said there,
but anyway, she's out there saying,
look, happy days are here again.
Any comments on Yellen's comments there?
And then what are you expecting, if anything,
to hear from the Fed this week?
- Well, so first of all,
Janet Yellen's never been right about anything.
So fake that with a grain of salt.
She's the one that said we'd never see a price
as a lifetime again, then we have the COVID shut down.
So, you just think of what it's worth.
We've written a couple of articles recently
about what's going on with the Fed
and we've made some comments in our daily commentary as well.
It was a very interesting change.
On December the 1st, Jerome Powell says,
"Hey, no reason to cut rates right now."
- We're not even thinking about talking about it, yeah.
- Exactly, just paraphrasing.
And then December 13th is like,
oh yeah, we're trying to figure out the best way
to start cutting rates.
It was like this immediate change.
And I've talked about this a little bit before,
but this reminds me very much of 2018 and 2019
where the Fed said,
hey, we're nowhere near the neutral rate.
Then a month later, they're at the neutral rate
and the markets are down 20%.
And then by June, they're cutting rates
and we're doing reverse repo and trying to stave off.
Some type of financial event in the markets.
And so this change in attitude certainly is suspicious
from the standpoint that there may be some stress
financially with one of their member banks
or maybe a few of them.
That there's a problem that's potentially brewing
in the overall economy.
And don't know that and we won't know that for a while,
but that change is certainly not something.
I mean, they were steadfast.
Say we're here to fight inflation.
Inflation is not at our target yet.
We're not even thinking about cutting rates.
And then all of a sudden we aren't.
That suggests there's some of the risks that's going on
that's out there that we may not be aware of yet.
And so from Powell standpoint,
you have to be somewhat concerned about this FOMO market
we've got going on
because that is increasing consumer confidence.
If you look at the last consumer confidence report,
it was a massive jump in consumer confidence.
And consumer confidence is now the highest it's been
in two and a half years.
That's not what you want in an economy
you're trying to slow down to beat inflation.
Personal spending just came in on Friday
up 7/10 of a percent.
Big jump in personal spending.
That's not what you want to see
if you're trying to combat inflation.
Now, PCE came in in line at 0.2,
but that spending, that consumption,
that confidence is not what you want.
I mean, this is the whole reason Ben Bernanke
did quantitative easing in 2010.
He says the reason we're doing quantitative easing
is to lift asset prices to boost consumer confidence
to strengthen the economy.
Well, you've got consumer confidence
running off the rails right now.
People's expectations of retirement income
is at an all time high.
People's expectations of inflation is dropping.
People's expectation of higher stock prices in the year
is very near a record.
So everybody's getting very, very bullish
about the economy and the markets and everything is great.
That's increasing consumer confidence.
That's inflationary.
That is going to provide some inflationary impulse
into the economy, or at least if not inflationary impulse,
it's going to make a contraction of inflation
much harder to obtain.
So instead of inflation being at 3% going to two,
it may hang out at two and a half or 2.8% for a while
because of just that consumer confidence.
Now, the big question, of course,
is how long can the consumer hang in there
considering they're borrowing money as fast as they can,
just to kind of sustain their lifestyle.
But we'll see how this plays out.
But it would not surprise me at the Fed meeting
to see Powell try to walk back
a little bit of this exuberance, try to push out.
The market's expecting five to seven rate cuts this year.
Can't imagine Jerome Powell coming out and confirming that.
I would expect him saying,
"We're thinking about cutting rates,
"but it might not be till the last half of this year,"
or something just to try to pull
some of the exuberance out of the market.
That wouldn't surprise me.
I'm not saying you will.
It just wouldn't surprise me if you did.
- Yeah, yeah.
It's so interesting about those confidence numbers too,
just because, and this is more anecdotal
than everything else.
But from what I hear from the average person
is not the sense of like, oh, best year ever, right?
Like, oh, all of a sudden I'm super,
I'm not worried anymore about the future.
And I'm not worried about this, the cost of living.
I'm not worried about these record high housing prices.
And even this job market that we're told is so amazing.
I hear lots and lots of stories of qualified people saying
like, who are between jobs saying like,
I'm sending out, I'm not gonna gazillion the doors
and I'm not hearing much back.
I mean, there does seem to be a real disconnect
between the headlines and some of the data
that's being touted and the general vibe,
at least that I hear.
And I realized that that's anecdotal,
but obviously you don't have to scratch much at all
to go on the internet and poke around,
do a couple of Google searches
and see lots and lots of articles
about the plight of the average consumer.
So it is interesting to see that disconnect.
- It is.
All right, so I wanna put up a chart here.
This is a chart on interest on the national debt.
And you can see here that it's just gone
completely exponential, almost vertical
as interest rates have cranked up here
with the Fed rate hike campaign.
And I wanna talk to you about the concept
of fiscal dominance, Lance.
But just looking at this chart,
there's lots of things that are exponential, right?
We can find all sorts of exponential trends
in the economy and whatnot,
but this has to have a limit on it, right?
'Cause this is money that has to be spent annually
and the US government annual budget is finite.
I mean, yeah, we can goose it up
with deficit spending and whatnot,
but not to infinity forever.
I mean, I guess if we wanna just kill the currency overnight,
sure.
- No, no, no, you got two different things going on here.
So first of all, you just said that,
this can't go indefinitely higher because of the budget.
We don't have a budget.
We haven't had a budget since 2008.
We run continuing resolutions,
which means that every year continuing resolution says,
okay, you had a trillion to spend last year,
this year you have a trillion plus 8%.
So everything is squeezed by 8%,
not including any additional spending they tack on.
So if interest rates remain exactly where they are
and don't move, right, interest rates will go up or down,
that interest service expense is gonna keep going up
in that parabolic line because we keep spending 8% more
than we did last year, just at the bear run.
That doesn't include any additional stuff
they throw on there like 150 billion for Ukraine
or whatever it is, right?
So yeah, it can just keep going up forever
because Janet Yellen can just turn on the printing press
and just print more dollars to pay it.
- Well-
- I'm not saying there's not a bad economic outcome
from that, but-
- Right, but when it overwhelms tax receipts
and there's all sorts of other mandatory spending
that has to go on,
the only thing you can do basically is borrow that, right?
And then that just destroys the currency.
So if we're worried about inflation
and it's getting to the point
where consumers are getting really angry about it.
- Yeah, but hold on a second.
How does borrowing money destroy the currency?
Because the dollar has been going up.
- Oh, I'm saying if the treasurer is borrowing it
from the Fed, right?
You know, if we get to the point where basically
the Fed has to print the money to let the treasury
then borrow to pay this stuff.
- Hold on a second, the Fed doesn't print money,
the treasury prints money.
The treasury is the printing press.
The Fed just credits the banks.
- Yeah, okay, so it's the enabler, right?
So basically if we go to the point
where we're just letting this thing go hog wild, right?
Presumably many other buyers are going to say,
look, I don't want to buy your treasury bonds anymore.
You guys are fast becoming a banana republic.
The only buyer out there is the Fed.
But my point is that this is growing so much faster
than receipts, right?
And so it basically overwhelms everything else
that we're doing.
And we either have to make a decision to say,
look, we've got to do something to get this under control
or we're going to go full banana republic.
- Well, see, there's a lot of fallacy though, Matt,
because again, now you're talking,
you've got to introduce the concept
of reserve currency status.
You've got to do all this other stuff because again, look,
I'm not arguing that printing money and debt is a good thing.
Don't get me wrong on this, but we've got to be careful
with the statements that we make
because they have consequences.
So right now we're printing a lot of debt, right?
It took $2.50 of debt just to generate
the dollar's worth of growth last year.
I mean, that's just where we are.
If you look at it longer term,
we're spending closer to $5 of debt to spend
to create dollars worth of growth.
That's not a long-term benefit.
That's why we don't have economic growth.
If you take a look at economic prosperity
and those types of things,
the reason that we don't have that,
and the reason, back in the '90s,
we used to say 2% economic growth was pre-recession.
That was a recession warning.
If you're at 2% economic growth,
you got to be careful you're about to be in a recession.
- Right, now we're like, good job.
- Yeah, we're just like,
man, if we can just get 2% growth,
we're doing awesome, right?
That's terrible, and that's a function
of all this debt that we've got going.
But yes, right now there's no limit
to how much money we can print.
There's really not a limit to the debt that we can produce
because right now there's nowhere else
for anybody else to store currency.
You're not going to store it in Russia, China,
Brazil, Venezuela.
Your only place to store reserve currencies,
which is also a big part of that money market balance,
is foreign deposits.
So the government right now
has a tremendous amount of runway
because there's no alternative.
I'm not saying that there won't be,
and it's not going to be Bitcoin.
- Right, you're arguing the Brent-Johnson dollar milkshake,
like love it or hate it, it's-
- It's just the fact- - It's the system, yeah.
- Yeah, it's just the fact of what it is.
And unfortunately, right,
this keeps our government being fiscally responsible.
And I completely support your point that you're making.
Don't think I'm arguing with you because I'm not.
It's just important to understand that when you say things
like it's going to destroy our currency,
immediately I start getting emails from people going,
if the currency's going to zero,
then why am I invested in stocks, right?
It's just, we're talking about something that's taking
decades and probably will be dead before this occurs.
I mean, look at Japan as a function of that.
- Yeah, although let's tug on that
because I don't necessarily know the answer here.
And I understand the risk that you're talking about,
but at this exponential, I mean,
this getting now sort of near vertical,
let's just assume that we just said, we don't care, right?
- We've already said, we don't care.
- I know, but we- - Every continuing resolution
is a, we don't care.
- Right, but really we don't care, right?
That like, whatever, you know what, so what?
This thing just goes way higher than the revenues
we take in every year and we'll just, sure,
we'll borrow 10 trillion in a little bit
and then we'll borrow a hundred trillion, right?
Whatever, right?
You know, that will accelerate the decline
of purchasing power in the US dollar
as we, as Americans within America will experience it.
- Absolutely. - Yeah, so-
- Your quality of life will get worse.
- Right, and it'll get worse faster
if we continue growing at an exponential rate
'cause exponentials speed up as they go on, right?
- That's correct, no argument there.
- Okay, yeah, and just to be clear to your point,
no one's saying it's gonna go
into the dumpster of history tomorrow,
but we're at a concerning point here, right?
Where this is, you know, I don't have to chart up anymore,
but I mean, it's-
- Well, no, but it's a true point, but like I said,
you know, we're at 120%, I don't know,
I haven't looked at the latest number
'cause it gets moved so fast today,
but you know, we're at like 120% of that GDP.
Japan's at 230, right?
And take a look at what's going on
with the Nikkei stock market.
You know, it's just, it's going,
talk about something going vertical.
That's the, you know, the Nikkei.
So, you know, it's just, you know,
these, you know, this can last.
And here's, this is my point, right?
Again, I'm not- - And I don't disagree
with this point you're about to make, just to be clear.
- Yeah, and yeah, just, you know, I'm not disagreeing
with you about the evils of just being fiscally,
you know, irresponsible, which our government is doing.
It's just, it can last so much longer
than you can possibly imagine.
And again, you know, I'll be dead probably
before this becomes a real problem.
Unfortunately, my kids' kids,
I really don't envy the future for my kids.
They're gonna have a challenge.
I think their children are gonna really have a challenge.
- Yeah, I agree.
My hope is that the challenge gets addressed
just because it's, I think it may just have to be
in our kids' lives and then maybe our grandkids,
we can hope that they're, you know,
whatever follows, saner thinking will prevail
and there'll be growing up in that better world.
But I don't know, time will tell.
- I mean, considering we've got,
we're about to have civil war break out on the Texas border.
- Hey, hey, hey, you're getting to my rant.
Hold on to that for a second.
- Don't, yeah, don't, don't, don't.
- I'll jump there, okay.
- Yeah, don't, don't get the punch on that too early.
Okay, but, but again, I want to,
I want to push back just for debate sense on this,
which is, yeah, in terms of like the US dollar
potentially losing its reserve currency status
and all that stuff.
Yeah, that's probably after we're dead, right?
But you and I could have had this discussion
about the profligacy of, you know, the spending profligacy
of our government and our concerns about purchasing power
and all that stuff four years ago,
before anyone had ever heard of COVID, right?
And when you look at the inflection that that chart took,
right, in my mind, that just speeds up the timer here.
And, you know, you look at just the trauma
that household purchasing power has taken
in the past three years, right?
Like, you know, if we continue going at the rate
at which we're currently going at right now, or faster,
which exponential systems suggest will happen,
I can see some real problems happening
in our lifetimes around this.
And again, it's not from a Mad Max standpoint or whatnot,
or collapse of the empire, but it's just like,
this is the other rant I was going to have with you.
Maybe I'll pull this up here.
Home heating costs have gone bananas this year, right?
I mean, there's lots of other costs that have gone up.
We railed in the past about like insurance costs
that are going up across a lot of homes right now.
But in addition to all the other cost of livings
at the grocery store, you know, at medical care,
at the pump, education, all that type of stuff,
all of a sudden, just essentials for living,
like staying warm in the winter time,
have gotten a lot more expensive.
And I just saw an article the other day that said,
heating your home in the winter has now become a luxury
for many people.
And I'll tell you, and I hate to share this,
it's probably going to blow some people's minds,
but I just got a warning two days ago from PG&E,
which is the electrical and gas company
out here in California.
- The lights on the car.
- That my home heating bill is in danger
of passing a thousand dollars this month, right?
And I'm just like, I mean, I'm blown away from that.
We certainly haven't done anything differently
than we normally do.
And I'm just thinking, I don't know how many families
could have their home heating bill, you know,
go from like 300 bucks a month
to a thousand bucks a month this quickly, right?
So like, I do worry because we're seeing such an increase
in the cost of living on the essentials right now
that if we continue growing at this pace,
like there's a good chunk of America
that's going to have to start tapping out
and just say, I can't do it.
- Yeah, no, I mean, it's problematic.
I mean, we're seeing it, it's interesting because,
you know, we just had sub 20 degrees here
and I love cold weather, right?
So like we don't even turn our heater on in our house.
- Yeah, but cold weather for you
is like you're seeing a purple elephant.
It's a rare thing that you hardly-
- It gets hot, you know, that's for sure.
But yeah, I mean, heating and cooling both,
and that was my point, heating and cooling both
is getting expensive depending on where you live, right?
So you live up north, you worry about the heating costs
'cause it never gets that hot in the summer.
In the south, you know, the heating in the winter
is not that big of a deal.
It's the summer cooling that becomes very problematic.
- Right, and starting to interrupt,
but your point is that like, these aren't luxuries.
These are existential needs, right?
You live in Minnesota, you die in the winter
if your house isn't warm enough.
You live in Texas, you die if you can't cool down
when it's like 112 outside.
- Yeah, no, absolutely.
I mean, how many people or how many articles
do you read every year where somebody, you know,
burned their house down 'cause they started a fire
inside their house to stay warm, right?
So, you know, it's just that kind of stuff.
But yeah, no, look, this is what I was saying earlier
about, you know, when you talk about money market funds,
you talk about, you know, these types of things.
You also have to understand that money market balances
by and large is just a point of what we're talking about,
is held by a very small percentage of people, right?
The vast majority of people have no savings.
And so if you already have no savings,
and then your cost of heating goes up dramatically,
and the cost of food goes up dramatically,
and the cost of these other things go up,
you know, it's a fight.
And look, I see, you know, when I'm like on social media,
on Twitter and stuff, I get, you know,
I just get inundated with people's comments about,
well, a good example of this, right,
as I published this article
about money market account balances,
and I made this statement in the article.
Let me, hold on a second.
Let me just read this statement to you
'cause it sparked a whole big fight in the...
- Wait, you said something that sparked a fight?
I don't believe that, Lance.
- So Adam, this is actually a point that I made
earlier this week.
I wrote an article.
Newsmax asked me to write an article for them
about these all-time highs in the markets.
And really to the point of what we're talking about, right,
this all goes back to sentiment.
And, you know, if you're having trouble heating your home
and you're having trouble, you know,
putting food on the table, your sentiment's not great.
As we were talking about before, you know,
this sentiment issue is very interesting because again,
we are, to your point you made is that, you know,
what we're seeing sentiment increase,
this is a composite index of consumer sentiment.
So the black line is the consumer confidence.
The blue line is consumer expectations.
They have improved, right?
But they're well off their highs.
And so even though we're seeing some improvement,
that improvement is really kind of on the upper end
of income earners that are, the market's going up,
their stock balances are going up,
their 401k plan's going up.
And, you know, when you talk about 401k plans,
that's 25% of the population.
Big chunk of people are not in 401k plans.
So they're not getting that benefit.
But, you know, this is, and so I made this statement.
I said, so when, you know, you're looking at this
as consumer confidence improves,
I said, this was the quote that I put out
that it got a ton of lash back on Twitter
because I said, "Given that higher rates remain
and consumers have drained most of their savings,
there is likely only a limited impact
on further improvements in confidence.
While stocks are currently registering all time highs,
much of that gain is based on the assumption
the Federal Reserve will cut rates
and reintroduce monetary liquidity."
So the comment was, is that is a super elitist statement.
Only people in the financial markets, you know,
get the benefit from those Fed policies.
That's actually a true statement that they made, right?
Because 80% of Americans don't participate
in what's happening.
And so when you talk about things
like increasing heating costs, increasing cooling costs,
that's the real world of what's going on.
And there's a massive gap right now
between people's ability to make ends meet
and their ability to invest in the stock market,
as an example.
That just doesn't exist for a lot of people.
- I don't know what else I can say
except just sort of amen, brother.
I think you've really put your finger on it there.
And I know we rant about this an awful lot
in terms of the massive disparity
between what the top households enjoy
and all the pain that dribbles down to the bottom,
what do you want to say, 80%, 90%?
- Yeah, exactly.
- Well, it's gonna be super interesting
as to how this manifests throughout the rest of the year,
especially given that it's election year
and how much of this bubbles up, you know,
onto the radar of the two candidates
running for president at the end.
It's interesting because things like immigration right now
are at the top for a lot.
And we're gonna talk a little bit about that in a moment.
But these sort of, you know, base needs,
I think are gonna be a higher, you know,
this is gonna be one of those,
it's the economy stupid elections, I think, you know,
especially as we get closer to November.
Hey, real quick,
because it's related to that quote you just talked about,
I want to get back to that point of fiscal dominance.
So I'm gonna read this definition here of fiscal dominance
so we can talk about it a bit.
Fiscal dominance occurs when a national debt
has reached levels such that a nation
is unable to pay it down with taxes
and requires monetary policy support
in order to stay solvent.
In such a situation, it is difficult to control inflation
because raising interest rates can make it impossible
for the government to pay its debt.
So there's a number of analysts that I interview
that are beginning to say,
"Hey, we're now in the era of fiscal dominance."
And these are folks like Lynn Alden, Luke Gromen,
just to name a few.
You look at that interest rate spike
in that chart I just showed earlier,
and you're like, yeah, we're in the era where
it's really getting hard for the government
to pay what it needs to pay with the national income
that comes in, and it's having to resort
to ever greater deficit spending and borrowing,
and that's the fiscal side of things here, right?
- And then it's also, to your point earlier about the Fed,
monetizing debt, that's why going forward,
the Fed's gonna have to monetize 30 to 40%
of the debt issuance because interest rates can't go up.
You can't have increasing deficits
being generated by interest rates,
so they're gonna have to suppress interest rates
in order to keep issuing the debt.
So to your point earlier,
the Fed's gonna have to monetize a lot of that debt issuance
to keep rates down at a level that's maintainable.
- Right, so the problem with this is,
I mean, there are all the issues
that are gonna come from that,
but as the fiscal side is being more and more relied on,
two things happen.
One is that's money that gets out eventually
into the economy and creates inflation, right?
And then secondarily, what this is saying is the Fed
kinda has to start beginning to give up
its inflation mandate 'cause it's like,
I'm just trying to hold the system together
at this point, right?
So to your earlier comment there about,
you know, Powell might be walking down expectations of,
hey, maybe I'm not gonna cut as much and whatnot,
like in an era of fiscal dominance,
it gets harder and harder for the Fed to tame inflation.
And, you know, Fed's kinda almost taken
a premature victory lap here that like inflation's
totally done and the markets are parting hard,
you know, based on that.
But that might be one of the surprises coming to the markets
and the general economy going forward here is
if we are indeed in this era of fiscal dominance,
the Fed really may not be able to keep that horse,
either get the horse back in the barn
or keep it in that barn.
- Right, well, this is why QTE is scheduled to end
probably in March, if not May,
and QE will be back by third quarter of the year,
because again, you've got to get interest rates down,
you've got to monetize the debt,
you've got to reintroduce liquidity
back into the marketplace.
So, you know, that's why the Fed is making this about base
is because the risk is there.
The strain of liquidity from what they were doing
with hiking rates, rising deficit interest, all that,
that's all a drain on economic activity.
So if you're gonna try to sustain this,
particularly going into an election,
you're gonna have to start reversing that policy,
which is what's going on.
- So just to put you on the spot,
if you had to take the over or the under
on current inflation expectations for the next year or two,
what would you be taking?
- I've actually been talking about this a little bit.
Look, we're not gonna go back to 9% inflation.
Okay, that's not gonna happen,
unless we start issuing checks again
and shutting down the economy.
So right now we still have an abundance of inventory
that has to be worked off, so that's deflationary.
So, but it wouldn't surprise you now.
Now, remember though, we measure inflation
on a year-over-year basis.
So it wouldn't surprise me at all to see inflation
tick up to three and a half, maybe even closer to 4%
just on a year-over-year basis, that wouldn't be surprising.
If that occurs, we'll see what happens.
But if you have stronger economic activity
and we kind of keep on this pulse of activity
we've had going on.
And again, because of all this money coming into the economy
from the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act
and all that, which was not an Inflation Reduction Act,
it was an Inflation Builder Act.
So with all that money coming into the system,
it wouldn't surprise me to see inflation
tick up a little bit before it goes lower.
So again, I think that we're potentially
about to get into that timeframe
where the year-over-year comparisons are,
when you have a big drop in inflation
that if we come in with a 0.3, 0.4,
we see inflation tick up a little bit.
And so you see inflation kind of level off
and stabilize where it is.
And then once we tend to get out 25 or 26,
we see that start to tailor down towards 2%.
'Cause that's just going to be a function
of economic growth, ultimately.
So the more debt you have, the lower economic activity
you have, ultimately long-term.
So as we go from rather strong economic growth
in the third and fourth quarter of this past year,
that's going to start to tailor off as we get to 2025,
which as that economic growth slows,
that money comes out of the system,
inflation will come down with that.
But again, it may be longer to get there than people think.
- Okay, all right, let's see here.
So kind of related, interest rates and bonds.
So every week I always get asked the question,
"Hey, what's Lance's latest on bonds?"
So I made the mistake last week
of getting so wrapped up in our rant
that I didn't ask you your trades.
So I'm going to do that in a minute,
but if you can just give us the latest
on how you and your partner, Michael Liebowitz there,
are looking at bonds right now,
where you think interest rates are headed this year,
what impact you think that's going to have on bonds,
and then give a specific update on the TLT trade.
'Cause I get asked about that almost as much
as I'm sure you do.
Let's do that.
- So yeah, no, interest rates are, again,
just like I said, the Fed, the government,
have to get interest rates down.
That's just bottom line.
Interest rates are too high for the consumer.
It's too high for the economy.
It's too high for the debt.
So interest rates have to come down.
We've got too much debt in the system
to maintain these levels of interest rates.
The deflationary pressure from the debt
is going to drag economic growth lower.
That will drag inflation lower, ultimately,
and interest rates will track inflation over time.
So we talked about in November,
or actually in December,
that we had taken a little bit of that,
our bond trade off the table,
just took a little bit of profit,
'cause we had that big drop in yields
that really got to a very overbought level for bonds.
So bonds got very overbought short term.
So we've been going through that corrective process,
a very healthy one now for the fixed income market.
Bond prices have come back down.
They're sitting right on their moving average.
They started to bottom here lately.
We're getting oversold.
We're still on a MACD sell signal for bonds.
That's about to turn positive.
That signal is improving back towards a buy signal.
So I would suspect that within the next,
probably three weeks, maybe four,
that we're going to get a buy signal on bonds again.
So we're getting pretty close.
We've had enough time to work through
this overbought condition on bonds
to be in a good setup position now
for the next leg higher in the bond prices.
- Okay, so you guys are basically preparing
for an entry point here.
And will TLT still be your main vehicle
for making that trade or will you be buying
individual bonds like you had switched to earlier?
- Well, yeah, we switched from TLT to individual bonds
mid last year, second quarter of last year.
And then in our Simplevisor equity model, we use EDV.
We switched from TLT to EDV to extend the duration.
So that's where we'll be adding to.
- All right.
Hey, real quick, can you just give like the 60 seconds
on Simplevisor 'cause I've had a number of people
ask about it, in particular, people who live outside the US
to say, "Hey, is this something that I can subscribe to
"and just use it to inform my investing decision-making?"
Can you just remind folks that aren't familiar
with what Simplevisor is with that service price?
- Yeah, and actually we're going through
a whole big upgrade right now.
We're hoping to roll it out in the next month or so,
but we're completely revamping the whole site,
bringing in a whole bunch of new tools.
So I'm really excited about that.
I think it's gonna be great.
And we just launched a brand new portfolio this week
on that platform.
So, but Simplevisor is basically a do-it-yourself type
of investment research platform.
So as you want to research stocks, look at the markets,
build and track your own portfolios, you can do that.
We publish, there's a variety of information on here
talking about, we look at the internals of the market,
what's performing, major markets, analyzing those,
ETFs and sectors, what's working, what's not working.
Sentiment, we look, we run multiple sentiment indicators
that kind of tell you where we are within the market cycle,
what stocks are working, what stocks aren't working.
Of course, we post all of our insights
from our daily market updates to our trade alerts.
We post those, those actually get emailed to you
and texted to you as well.
Tons of research on, we talk about relative
versus absolute returns in the markets.
All of those tools are available on the site as well.
We have trading, we have screeners, just a variety of stuff.
And of course we also post our portfolios.
So again, you can research your own,
if you want to research a stock, do the chart,
we share the charts with you every week,
but we also post the portfolio models
that we run for our clients.
And like I said, we just launched on two days ago,
actually just launched a dividend model
that is 70% dividend yielding equities, 30% growth equity.
So it's a bit of a growth component
to give you some S&P type returns
with double the yield of the S&P 500.
So we're kind of working through this model right now,
but again, so these are all there for you.
And yes, if you live out of the country,
you can certainly use this.
When you put in your credit card information,
just use any state in the United States, so pick Texas,
and it'll work with Stripe,
which is the credit card processing company.
- Okay.
And is sort of the shorthand for folks to understand
just like, hey, if I want to do my own investing,
but I want to kind of look over the shoulder
of Lance and Mike and the team there at RIA,
this is the way to do it.
- Yep, absolutely.
So again, basically everything we do for our clients,
we post on this, we post our trades every day,
as soon as we make them.
So you kind of get, you don't have to do what we do.
I mean, it's just what we do for our clients
and you can either follow along or not.
All the tools are there to do all your own research.
So you can build your own portfolios,
track your own portfolios, do whatever.
And then in about another month,
we're going to launch all these portfolios
plus about six other portfolios
that you'll be able to just invest directly into
and have them managed for you.
- Okay.
And if folks want to learn more about this,
is it simplvisor.com or do they go to ria.com
and then find it?
- Simplvisor.com.
- Okay, great.
All right, okay.
So trades, do the trades for the past two weeks if you can,
because I forgot to ask you last week.
- No worries.
So the big bunch of trading this week
was the launch of the new dividend equity model.
So that was a big chunk of the trading
that we did this week.
We actually didn't do any,
you didn't miss anything from the previous week
'cause we didn't do any trades.
We did do a few trades this week in particular.
The first thing we did is like we swapped out,
we added back to Apple.
We had trimmed off Apple last year
and then the stock sold off a good bit, turned back up.
So we added back into our position in Apple.
And we also added a position of MGK,
which is the mega growth ETF into the ETF model.
Because again, we have S&P based performance
in the ETFs that we run in the ETF model,
but they're underweight that big MAG7.
So we had to add a little bit of exposure to the MAG7
to get a little bit more relative market performance.
So we started working on that.
We also added a little bit this week to UNH,
which got drug down with Humana earnings.
- You know the health care,
just for those who don't know the ticker.
- So yeah, on UnitedHealthcare,
we added a little bit to that position
because it just got drug down with the Humana earnings
and is actually at a very good kind of buy point.
So we add a little bit to that in our portfolio.
We took a little bit of profit out of AMD
'cause again, it's just gone straight up.
And we also added to our position
in Comcast Communications following their earnings.
They had really good earnings report.
So we added to our existing position there.
So it's been mostly just kind of,
we're still underweight equity a little bit.
We're running about 53, 54% equity out of 60%,
'cause it's a 60/40 model.
So we're still underweight equity.
We're still a little bit of cash.
So we're kind of wanting the market to pull back for us
so we can put the rest of that capital to work.
But we just didn't kind of nipping and tucking
around the edges with our portfolio.
Our portfolio is tracking the market pretty closely,
even though we're underweight cash,
which means we kind of got the right holdings,
and now we're just kind of rebalancing
weightings a little bit.
- Okay, help me just understand the Apple trade
a little bit more.
Was that more just a momentum trade,
or was there other reasons to get back into it?
- Technically, it had a nice correction,
got overbought, held support, turned back up,
and it's in the MAG-7.
Look, you may, look, I'm not a fan of Apple, right?
I'm with the 75% of the population
has a real phone called an Android.
So when y'all decide that,
when y'all get like waterproof technology
for the Apple phone,
Android had it like three years before you, right?
So shatterproof lenses, we had that like five years ago.
So y'all are slowly, you Apple people,
slowly catching up with our Android people.
But look, they're having trouble,
all kinds of trouble with,
they haven't grown revenues in five years, right?
So in fundamental play,
no, I'm not buying Apple for fundamentals,
I'm buying Apple because I need performance in my portfolio.
And today, I just did this analysis
for our presentation at the conference this weekend,
the top 10 stocks now make up 35% of the S&P 500.
So for every dollar that goes into 334 different
indexed ETFs and mutual funds,
35 cents of that goes into Apple.
And Eli Lilly, which we own,
and Berkshire Hathaway, which we own,
and Google, which we own.
And you see, and that's why we own those stocks.
We're not huge fans of those companies fundamentally,
but fundamentals, we're in a market right now
where fundamentals don't matter.
You can be a fundamental investor all day long,
and it doesn't matter, in fact, I made a,
let me see if I can find this tweet here real quick,
'cause I tweeted this out,
I think on Thursday, if I'm not mistaken.
But there was a very interesting graph about value.
Oh yeah, here it is.
So this is a graph.
So this is one year return on equity exposure
by manager style going through December.
And it's active manager holdings versus the benchmark.
And just what jumps out at you is that value
on the far right-hand side is the worst performer.
Growth, which is your growth stocks, Apple, Microsoft,
Google, the largest performer.
I said, the market reminds me of my dogs
when I take them on the walk.
They are well behaved and doing what they're supposed to,
other words, looking at fundamentals.
And then a squirrel runs across the path, growth stocks,
and all hell breaks loose.
And that's exactly what's going on in the market.
And so there's this argument that,
I'm just a fundamental investor.
Great, you can be a fundamental investor
and you're vastly underperforming the market,
because that's the market we have right now.
So we have to own these stocks
in order to make money for our clients,
but we do that with a very short leash.
- Yeah, and it's not lost on me here
that this is also the only sector,
growth is the only sector there
where the active managers had a worse track record
than just buying the basket and letting it ride, right?
So it's just kind of this mindless juggernaut right now.
And you might not like it,
you might not think it'll last forever,
but you do not want to stand in front of it right now.
- Yeah, but it's a very interesting, I don't know,
I really cannot fathom, I've thought about this a lot.
You know, what changes it, right?
Because as long as people keep piling into ETFs,
you proliferate the problem.
So the only way to get a bifurcation is,
all of a sudden people have to start selling their ETFs.
- You need net capital outflows, yeah.
- Yeah, and I don't know what causes that
outside of the next major credit crisis,
which will have, I mean, look, it's gonna happen, right?
We'll have a 73, 74 bear market again.
We're gonna have an 87 crash.
We'll have a dotcom crash.
We'll have a financial crisis of some sort.
I mean, it'll happen,
but we know we're in a secular bull market
and those tend to last between 17 and 20 years.
We're, you know, basically 13 years into this one.
So we got a ways to go yet.
- All right.
Okay, I gotta wrap things up here
given where we are time-wise.
I was gonna do two rants.
One was gonna be around housing.
And I'll just note here that there has been some life
flowing back into our frozen housing market recently.
Pending home sales rose a crazy 8.3% month over month.
We're now beginning to see certain areas of the country
that we're seeing the return of buying frenzy.
As I just saw an article this morning about the Hamptons,
you know, where all the rich people live,
that that's, you know, back in feeding frenzy mode,
home prices there are 2X what they were in 2019.
So they've fully doubled in four years.
But we're gonna have to put that aside.
We'll reserve that one hopefully for next week.
- I don't know if that's such a good one
'cause just real quick as a side note,
you were just having this conversation this morning
is that, you know, you take a look around
and one of the big trends going on right now in Texas
is to buy parcels of land
and you build a 600 square foot tiny home on it
and sell it for a quarter million dollars.
That's what's going on.
- So you're talking to a guy from California,
that sounds ridiculously cheap.
I know the outrage you feel at it,
but here we're like, of course, that's what people do here.
- You're talking about a quarter acre of land
with a 600 square foot house on it
paying a quarter million or $300,000.
Yeah, that's something that doesn't exist in Texas.
That never existed in Texas until the last 10 years.
It's just crazy.
And then it kind of died for a bit and now it's back.
I'm getting all kinds of feeds on this stuff now.
- Yeah, and I just put a tweet out and again,
we'll have to move 'cause the real rant I wanna have
in the little bit of time we have left,
which is way too little for it,
but is what's going on to the border right now.
But I just tweeted out an article about how the median,
the age of the median house in America is 40 years old
and almost 40% of the housing stock is older than I am
and I'm 52, right?
And I think one of the things that kind of often gets lost
in the whole housing debate is that essentially houses
are depreciating wooden boxes
and our housing stock is getting old.
And one of the problems is that increasingly
with all the other increases in the cost of owning a home,
insurance, we talked about property taxes have been going up,
people getting crunched by cost of living.
They're not able to afford the maintenance
and the upkeep as much as they did.
So to a certain extent housing,
the depreciation cost is getting larger as time goes on here
because people just aren't able
to invest in the home anymore.
You add that to the fact that over the past say 20 years
or so as houses became much more speculative assets
and you had these mass developments going up overnight
that the quality of the materials used for the house
has gone down and you can also make an argument
that the quality of the craftsmanship
has gone down as well.
So here we are basically saying, no, no, no, everybody,
you should still be paying today's current
really near all time high prices for houses
at all time high levels of unaffordability
at these high mortgage rates when a lot of these houses
are getting pretty long in the tooth
and they're not very well maintained.
So again, a rant for a different day Lance,
but I don't know, I just, I look at today's housing market
and just continue to scratch my head.
(Lance laughs)
- Yes.
- All right, so let's just squeeze in as much of a rant
as we can right here on what's going on with the border.
You and I have talked about this once or twice before,
but things are really reaching a boiling point
at this point in time.
So Lance, I believe the governor in your state,
if I got this right, has basically put his foot down hard
versus the federal government and said,
look, this is now such a crisis that we need,
we states that are, have a stake in a secure border,
we have to start mobilizing our national guard
and bringing them to get this border more secure.
And I think it's something like 25 states
have now just agreed to begin to mobilize
our national guards and bring them down to the border.
And this is sort of flying in the face right now
of federal policy.
And it's really forcing, I think, a big showdown
that I'm not sure the administration necessarily
wants to have in an election year.
But anyways, here we are.
So what's the vibe right now in Texas?
- Well, I mean, so first of all,
if you don't know what's going on,
I told you I just went on a hunting trip
to this actual place, right?
So this hunting lease that I went on
actually sits right on the Rio Grande,
right next to Laredo Springs
and some of these other areas that we're talking about.
And so this is right where they cross.
And the owner of this property runs like,
oh yeah, we find illegals here dead all the time
'cause they come across the border,
they drown on the way over,
they get drug up and just left on our property.
So look, we have 25 legal border crossings
across the border for people to cross safely.
And they have to go through the,
basically cross, go through the check-in
with the border patrol, et cetera.
But to bypass that, they do very dangerous things
like swim across the Rio Grande.
And so it leads to a lot of deaths.
And what Greg Abbott's trying to do is stop at this one park
that they have all the razor wire on right now,
is one of those very dangerous crossings.
And the reason that they do this is the cartels,
they basically push all these illegal immigrants
to go across these certain areas.
They get them all bulked up
and they run them across these areas of the border,
which detracts all the border guard
from where they're supposed to be at their stations
down to this area to deal with these crisis.
Well, when they detract all the border guards down,
the cartels run their drugs and human smuggling
and everything else across these gaps on the border.
So that's when we have this big influx
of criminal element into Texas.
And now Arizona has now done exactly the same Texas has,
and basically has declared an invasion into their state.
Now, this is important to understand
because this is the battle going on.
If you don't understand the battle that's going on,
Texas is only trying to secure its border.
We're just trying to stem the flow of illegal immigration
into Texas because all the criminal element
that's coming across the border into Texas.
And it's not-
- Well, it's not just the criminal element,
it's the fact that it's overwhelming
all your support systems, right?
Your hospitals and-
- Well, yeah, with that, you look at New York,
Greg Abbott started busting these illegals
to New York and Chicago and said,
"Here, take a few thousand of them.
We've got a million, take a few thousand."
And now New York and Chicago are like,
"We can't handle this, it's overwhelming us."
They had to shut down the school
and turn it into a housing shelter.
This is what we deal with every day here.
But importantly, we have no idea these people coming off.
These aren't people just from Mexico
and South America coming in.
These are people coming in from Yemen, Saudi Arabia,
others, terrorist countries,
they're filtering through the Southern border into the US.
- Afghanistan, Haiti, China,
I mean, they're not all terrorist countries,
but I mean, they're not just Mexicans and Latin Americans,
they're from all over, yeah.
- They're all over.
So what Governor Greg Abbott is trying to fix
is like saying, "Hey, look,
we're not trying to stop you from immigrating."
That's not what he's doing.
He's saying, "If you want to immigrate, do it legally.
Go through a checkpoint, come in,
and just go through the legal process
of becoming an immigrant.
That's all we're saying.
So we know who you are, we want you to be here, that's fine,
but we need to know who you are and where you're going."
He just, so he boarded up this park
and put the razor wire on it, and of course,
this is where the Biden administration is pushing back.
They're going, "No, we want our border patrol down there,
get rid of the razor wire and let these people in."
So you see what the problem is.
- Yeah, and sorry, Kate, can you help me understand?
And again, folks, this is a conversation
that's difficult to have
because there's strong emotions on all sides,
and I'm not trying to have this as a good or bad,
place a good or bad value judgment
on the people that are trying to get into this country.
I understand why probably seven plus billion
of the world's people would love to live in America
if given the chance, and these people are oftentimes
leaving, most cases leaving living situations
that are existentially threatening, terrible,
they want to raise their kids in a better place.
I totally get all that.
I'm just trying to see if we can understand the facts here
because it has social, but also economic implications,
and that's why it's related to this series,
which focuses on financial issues.
So facts-wise, Lance, as best you understand,
what is the rationale for the pushback
where the federal border control wants to remove
the razor wire that's been put down
to help keep people from crossing illegally?
We've seen the footage recently of what,
it's like a bulldozer coming and lifting the razor wire
so that these people can get through.
Like, what is the rationale for that,
whether we agree with it or not?
- Because, so the Biden, according,
this is according to Governor Greg Abbott, right?
So the Biden administration wants these illegals
to come into it.
Even President Biden himself said that we need these,
we need these kind of working age men to come in
to the country, we need this.
And again, just to be clear, Greg Abbott,
everybody else is, and conservatives in general,
nobody is opposed to immigration, right?
We need immigration.
We've got to have immigration, we're to grow our economy.
It is the illegal immigration, and more importantly,
the undocumented illegal immigration that's coming in
to where we don't know who's coming in.
And look, I live in Houston,
and we have just a tremendous amount of immigration
coming in the city of Houston.
We have a horrible crime rate in Houston.
Now, if you look at city statistics,
they'll tell you, like Chicago, Baltimore, New York, Houston,
their crime rates are coming down.
That's not true at all.
It's that we don't prosecute people when they're caught,
and we release them.
And so we don't, we let them out, we bring them in,
we charge them, but we don't prosecute them.
So it looks like the crime rate is coming down in Houston.
It's getting worse, and the crime rate is a real problem.
But here's the statement.
So the Supreme Court recently ruled, says,
"Hey, we're just putting a stay on this thing.
We're going to let the lower court deal with this issue
so the Biden administration can remove the razor wire
for right now if they want."
Greg Abbott has said, "No, you're not," and here's why.
This is his statement.
"The executive branch of the United States
has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws
protecting states, including immigration laws
on the books right now."
And this is the statement.
"President Biden has instructed his agencies
to ignore federal statutes that mandate the detention
of illegal immigrants.
The failure of the Biden administration
to fulfill the duties imposed by Article 4, Section 4,
has triggered Article 1, Section 10, Clause 3,
that's of the Constitution, which reserves to this state,
the state of Texas, the right of self-defense.
For those reasons, I have already declared an invasion
under Article 1, Section 10, Clause 3,
to invoke Texas's constitutional authority
to defend and protect itself.
That authority is the supreme law of the land
and supersedes any federal statutes to the contrary
because it's from the Constitution."
Arizona just did the same thing yesterday.
- All right, super interesting.
And look, folks, the intent here
is not to make this a partisan discussion.
That being said, it is a state versus government,
and right now there's, you know.
- No, this is hugely fascinating, right?
This is, what's going on is hugely fascinating
from an economic perspective,
just a historical perspective,
because this is one of those points
where you now have a state
standing up against the government.
This is, and this is why there's a lot of talk right now
about the Civil War starting here,
because this is, you know,
this is the South standing up to the North, right?
You know, the Democratic South was all pro-slavery.
The Republican North, Abraham Lincoln,
they were trying to abolish slavery.
That was the whole juxt of the,
what led up to the Civil War, right?
So, you know, so as we take a look
at where we are history-wise,
this is one of those very interesting moments in time
where we're going to look back.
This is going to make the history books,
because we'll look back at this and go,
this was either the brink of, or the start of,
or could have been the issue of,
you know, a much broader issue.
And there's more and more states,
and again, if you take a look at the states,
Florida, Tennessee, Kentucky, other states,
other red states are putting their support
behind Texas and Governor Greg Abbott.
And you've got 25, 28 states right now
all supporting the state of Texas.
- Yeah, and that's why I talked about those 25 states.
Now, again, words matter.
I know it's getting tossed out there.
I don't necessarily see this as being like
the potential start of the next Civil War.
And the reason why is I don't see the nation
as divided, people on the streets about,
I'm super pro-illegal immigration and open borders
versus, yeah, a country should have a border policy
and figure out how to enforce it, right?
Now, there's definitely loggerheads
between federal policy right now
and the states that are having to deal
with the daily reality of what's going on.
And it is clearly, as we've said for a long time now,
unsustainable.
So I agree, it's getting super interesting.
I'm super interested to see how we end up fixing this.
- Now, I will tell you this.
I heard a really great interview yesterday
between a border patrol agent and a commentator
who's basically a commentator, who's on the radio,
and he had a border patrol agent
and he had one of the guards from the border.
And they were like, look,
the Biden administration wants us to come in
and we've got our orders to come in
and basically just process illegals.
Now, here's the problem with how we process illegals,
by the way, is that what should happen is they come in
and they say, okay, I want to come into the country.
And then they have to go to a hearing,
they have to go through this whole hearing thing,
and then they get processed into the country
on a legal basis, right?
- And meaning we know who they are,
we kind of know where they're going to go, yeah.
- So now what they do, but because of this big flood,
what they do is they come in and they say,
okay, look, you're here,
here's a piece of paper that you just sign it.
And we have no idea who these people are,
they don't have ID.
So they just sign whatever name or they mark it with an X
and it's a promise to appear.
And so like in three years,
they're supposed to appear in front of a judge
and then they show up again.
And so they're in the country
and we give them plane tickets.
There is an app for the border patrol that they can use
to actually use as a form of identification.
They can get it on an airplane and fly.
We have to go through the TSA pat down.
We got to show our IDs.
We got to do all this stuff to get on an airplane.
They don't have to, they just show this border patrol app
that has their name on it, says they're here illegally
and they can get on a plane
and fly to wherever they want to go.
So that's kind of scary.
But what this is going to lead to,
and they were talking between the border guard
and the patrol, they're saying,
look, we want to work together.
There's not this big conflict
between the federal government.
They're all just going to come down in armed forces
and do this.
Look, we know the border patrol has to do their job.
We're trying to do our job and secure the border.
We're going to figure out how to work together.
So this'll be something that works itself out.
What'll be interesting from the political front
is how this heats up in the media as this goes on.
- Absolutely.
And I don't know if it was in New Hampshire,
the New Hampshire primary, but in the Iowa primary,
it was the number one issue
that folks said they were voting on.
So it's going to be interesting to see
if that continues throughout the year
or my prediction is, I mean, if it gets worse,
it probably will stay there,
but my prediction is that some of these basic economic,
like I'm just having trouble affording my way of life,
issues might supplant it,
but it's definitely right up there at the top right now.
It's something Americans really care about.
- Well, look, we just saw the employment numbers
here recently.
The number of foreign born workers
that are in the United States is,
you know, you were talking earlier about, you know,
people trying to get a job and I've seen,
I've talked to a lot of people.
They've sent out like 1400 resumes, right?
They can't get a job.
And, you know, when you get down to lower wage paying scale,
you know, these illegal immigrants,
they are getting jobs here, right?
They're taking jobs from native born workers.
And when you have 3 million plus in the system,
that makes a dent and particularly when you're talking about
restaurant worker jobs and wait, you know, waiters,
waitresses, you know, you know, those types of things,
you know, kind of lowering the kind of that
lower end scale of the jobs, you know,
we can hire cheap labor doing that, right?
And so it's, it has a consequence economically,
where it's not necessarily that great
for the average American.
- Yeah, and so that's kind of where I come to all this.
And yes, there's the humanitarian side
and, you know, that should be paramount,
but I'm always with any issue saying, okay,
well, what are the economics?
And I just think, you know,
how do we afford the influx of this many more people
onto our social support systems in our economy, right?
And you just talked about one of the issues where,
you know, this may be, you know,
maybe biting US born workers,
US citizens on the lower end of the pay scale,
but also I mentioned, you know,
this is happening all over, but there was a stat,
I think it was a hospital in Denver or something like that,
that they, over some period,
I don't know if it was a weekend or a week or a month
or whatever, but it was something like they said,
our emergency room system in the state saw 50,000 people,
which was a huge spike
from what the normal period was.
And they said 20,000 of them were illegal immigrants,
basically, and they're just saying like,
we're getting overwhelmed by the volume of people
that are coming in and drawing on their services.
And of course these people don't have any money to pay,
right, but the hospital is not gonna turn them away, right?
So, you know-
- Which that right there is such a critical point
because, you know,
the average American complains about healthcare costs.
And, you know, this was always one of the fallacies
behind the Obama Affordable Care Act is that,
oh, there's 20 million people in the U.S. without insurance
and they can't get access to healthcare.
That was a bull face lie because you go to the hospital,
you're taken care of, period, right?
But somebody is gonna pay for it.
And so when you have all these illegals
coming in the system, getting free healthcare,
somebody is gonna have to pay for it and that's you.
So I mean, and look, and again,
I'm not against immigration at all.
Don't think that for a moment.
I am very pro-immigration.
We must have immigration in order to grow our economy
'cause we're not having enough kids.
- Yeah, especially 'cause their birth rates
are dropping so fast.
- So, you know, what we're talking about
and very specifically what we're talking about
is an overwhelming amount of illegal immigration
that's potentially letting very dangerous people
into our country.
And again, you know, at some point we let a terrorist in,
he blows up something in a major city
and then everybody's gonna be very, you know,
anti illegal immigration.
Unfortunately, it'll take that type of thing.
And then everybody will understand
what the danger of illegal immigration is,
but that's the rip.
That's what Greg Abbott has been telling people.
It's like, look, there are people coming in this country
that are very dangerous and we, you know,
we need to be aware of that.
- Right, and even short of that and, you know,
let's all hope that that doesn't happen,
but obviously the risk of it goes up
with the more of these people that flood across
that we don't know who they are.
But just all you have to do is look at the fentanyl problem
that's going on right now, right?
I mean, it's just when you have a border
where this many people can get through,
because of course we only know the people
that we monitor and see, right?
So what's the size that are making it through
that we just don't know, right?
- It's that, the belief stat at the moment
is that we catch about 30% of what crosses.
- Yeah, which is, if you look at the numbers
that we do, are able to report on,
and if you double that, more than double that,
it's just, it's mind blowing.
And then of course, the issue that I always have too,
is like, we have a human capital problem in this country,
irrespective of illegal immigration, right?
Where we've got, what's the status,
over a hundred million US adults, age 18 and over,
who are considered out of the workforce,
criminally out of the workforce.
The government has ever given up
on them getting a job again.
Now, some of them are seniors who were too old to work,
some are in college, but there's a big and growing chunk
of just unemployed, underemployed Americans
that are sitting on a couch, playing video games,
you know, not feeling super optimistic about their lives.
We need to be using the existing human capital here better
before we bring in floods of other people
that we don't know what to do with, right?
- Well, and then Vitti also talked about, you know,
when, you know, like I told you,
when I was down hunting on the border, you know,
I was talking to the owners of the property and like,
oh yeah, well, you know, we see them
when they come across the border,
and the border guard, you know, gives them $5,000, you know,
gives them a ticket to wherever they need to go
or wherever they're going to send them.
But, you know, so there's money
that's being given to these people.
- So say that again, are we really like giving
the average processed guy five grand?
- Yeah, and this is according to them.
Now, look, I was just on the border and he's like,
yeah, we see them all the time, they come over,
they hand them basically a debit card with five grand on it
and they give them a ticket and they put them on,
or they put them on a bus and send them somewhere.
But yeah, I mean, there's money, I mean, this isn't,
just 'cause they come across the border,
they're tapping into our social welfare system.
So we're having, you know, taxpayers,
all taxpayers are having to pay for this.
So you may be pro illegal immigration,
and again, that's a you thing.
If you think everybody should be allowed to come here,
that's awesome, just realize you're paying for it.
You're paying for it at higher healthcare costs,
you're paying for it with your tax dollars,
and that's all fine and dandy.
And if you're good with it, I got no problem with you.
That's a you thing.
All I'm telling you is that, you know,
there is a cost to this that, you know,
when, if you're struggling to make ends meet,
maybe we should be focusing our efforts
on taking care of our citizens first
and then all this other stuff maybe second.
- Right, and you know, part of the cost too
is the human cost of all the people who have the promise of,
oh, I'm gonna get into America, right?
And they're coming from somewhere deep in South America
or some other far flung country.
And it's a treacherous journey, right?
So what we don't see is all the people who die along the way
because it's a risky perilous journey.
All right, we got to end it there.
I wanted to put this brightly on our radar folks here
just because it is happening now.
It is very germane to what's going on today,
but it does impact the economy and it is highly likely,
I think, for better or worse,
to become even more of a focal focus point,
even more of a flashpoint going forward.
So I don't want to be late to the discussion
if indeed we, you know, there are big developments here
that we want to talk about in the future.
All right, well, in wrapping things up here, folks,
I just want to give some happy news
about goings on here at Thoughtful Money.
One, thoughtfulmoney.com.
The website is now live, as I mentioned.
So for, you know, all the discussion that Lance and I
have had up to this point in time,
it is a tricky time for people to navigate what's going on
if you're a regular investor.
There's some great services out there like simplivisor.com.
You know, if you want to look over the shoulder
of a good financial advisor like Lance,
but for a lot of people,
they don't want to look over the shoulder.
They actually want the good financial advisor
to manage their money for them
to be their financial quarterback.
That's the main reason why I have Lance
and the guys from New Harbor on this channel every week
is I want you to see what a good financial advisor
looks like, one that takes into account
all the macro issues that the interview guests
and I discuss on this channel week after week after week.
And I want to have you see how they react to changes
in the market and how they're allocating their capital.
Lance does a great job of being fully transparent on that.
So if you are just a regular investor
and you would like to get a little bit of direction
from a professional financial advisor like Lance
or the guys at New Harbor,
we've got a firm up in Canada as well,
then go fill out the short form at thoughtfulmoney.com
and have a free consultation with these guys.
There's no commitment to work with them.
There are no strings attached.
It's just a public service that these firms offer
to help regular people who are busy with their lives,
running their families,
trying to figure out their own work lives
and being able to help them
by becoming their financial quarterbacks
and managing the financial parts of their lives
so that regular people can go off
and do all the things that they need to focus on.
And let's see what else.
As I mentioned earlier too,
the conference that's coming up for Thoughtful Money,
