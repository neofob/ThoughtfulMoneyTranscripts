Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. When I interviewed today's guest expert back in August of 2021, when
inflation was 5%, he made the bold prediction that the CPI would eventually hit 9%, a prediction that at that time seemed unthinkable, but it
indeed proved true less than just a year later. He then called for inflation to moderate substantially, which it also then did. So where does he see
inflation headed from here? To find out, as well as hear his latest outlook on the economy, recession risk, social stability, and the markets, we welcome
back Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Steve, thanks so much for joining us
today. Great to be with you, Adam. Always a pleasure, Steve. I know it's a very busy week for you. Thank you for making time for this conversation. Lots to
get through, especially because you're located there in Baltimore and you just had a pretty serious tragedy happen in your city this week. If we can,
let's start with the general question I'd like to ask at the beginning of these discussions. What's your current assessment of the global economy
and financial markets? Things are generally sailing along pretty smoothly. However, I think there are a number of risks that are significant. We have
two wars going on right now. Obviously, the one's been going on for some time with Russia and Ukraine. And that one doesn't seem to be, even though
the Russians clearly have the upper hand in the thing, it doesn't seem to be winding down. And also the one in the Middle East with Israel and Gaza is
not as contained as people like. The narrative coming out of Washington is that it's all contained or Jerusalem, it's all contained. Everything's
very, very carefully calibrated and so forth. But in fact, things are, shall we say, unsettled in the region itself. So we have those two things. And
then we have a real confrontation with the US and China. I mean, it's a commercial war that was really articulated and laid out in a long report
by the Department of Commerce last April. So there's a lot of uncertainty in the picture, although nothing is crashing and burning as we speak.
Okay, and so that's more sort of the geopolitical global economy side. Just curious about the markets. We just finished a barn burner of a Q1
valuations, you could say maybe somewhat stretched. What do you think?
Well, let's come back to the US. The markets have been a barn burner. I think the markets just a little ahead of where it should be, even though
the PEs, what do we got PE on the S&P around 30. And remember from 1998 to 2000, it went up and peaked out at 55. So you can argue the bullish
case is it's got a ways to run. But of course, remember after it peaked in 2000, we then had something called a crash. So I think the markets
pretty pricey, and I'd be very cautious. I'd be more the Warren Buffett kind of mode. Set up a pile of cash and wait until the thing crashes and
move in then for the picking.
Okay. All right. Well, look, we'll get more to the market in a bit, but staying on kind of the global trends, because I know you spend a lot of time
looking at the big macro trends that are driving the action. I'm curious to hear which trends have your attention the most right now. I do know one
of them is what's happening on the monetary side with countries and specifically, you track the currency purchasing power, or maybe more
specifically, the destruction of the currency purchasing power in a lot of countries around the world. You talk about a lot of the examples of really
almost out of control inflation in a lot of countries and just to note a few I've taken from some of your writings. Turkey right now is at 74%
inflation per year, Argentina inflation doubled during Malay's first month in office, Syria is running at 95% per year, Iran's at 44% per year. It
seems sort of like currency has gone wild in an increasing number of countries around the world.
Well, you've got about a dozen that are really in bad shape. You mentioned a few there. The top one actually is Zimbabwe, where the annual
inflation rate I measure every day, it's about 1200% per year. That's the highest inflation rate in the world. You mentioned Turkey is around 74.
That one's interesting because let's go through the ones that you talked about for a minute. Turkey, Erdogan obviously was re-elected and
replaced the governor of the central bank and supposedly adopted orthodoxy. They had a very unorthodox policy at the central bank, which was
based on Erdogan's ideas and Erdogan, his basic idea was that you have a positive relationship between interest rates and inflation. So if you
want low inflation, you should impose low interest rates. If you want high inflation, you impose high interest rates. So he had the whole thing
upside down. He replaced the central bank governor, but they have never been able to get the money supply under control. It's growing at about 65%
per year in Turkey. So that's way higher than it should be if they wanted to hit any kind of a reasonable level of inflation. So Turkey's got a real
problem. They've increased their interest rates enormously since a new governor has arrived. Actually, they've had two governors. We had one
and she resigned in somewhat of a scandal and we now have a new one. This is just since Erdogan was re-elected last year. The key lesson there
and message is that monetary policy is not about interest rates. It's about changes in the money supply. That's the lesson and that's a lesson we
learned from Milton Friedman. So that's the key thing. They have increased interest rates dramatically in Turkey, but they have not been able to
control growth in the money supply and it's the money supply that causes inflation to change. So that's Turkey. Now Argentina, we had Malay was
elected and went into office in December. Since he went in, he has not delivered on his main campaign promise, which was to replace the peso with
the US dollar, to dollarize the economy. Right, that would have crushed inflation, Adam, but inflation has actually gone up. The official
inflation number now is up around 270% per year.
Alright, and I'm curious, I read some of your reports saying that you had optimistic expectations for Malay and a lot of his reforms, but
the fact that he dropped the dollarization one is really concerning you. Well, yes, that really is his Achilles heel. I think a fatal mistake
because the first thing you have to do, if you have a country where you have raging inflation, triple digit inflation, and endemic inflation like
Argentina, you have to crush the inflation. That gives you credibility and it stabilizes the economy and stability might not be everything,
Adam, but everything is nothing without stability. So if you crush inflation, you stabilize the situation, then you can take the next step with
reforms. He got the sequence of things all wrong. He abandoned the idea of getting rid of the central bank, getting rid of the peso,
replacing the peso with the dollar. He put that on the sideline, on the back burner, and he started throwing in these proposals for rather
radical reforms, which of course have to eventually be done, but he has virtually no credibility. The inflation got worse, not better.
So why do you think he did that? Because you're right, it was a huge thing you ran on. I think he had very bad technical advice and the
technical advice that he'd received from his own people, as well as people like experts from the IMF who, by the way, are against
dollarization, but they said it wasn't feasible. They advised him you can't do it because the net foreign reserve position at the central
bank is negative and I analyze the thing very carefully because I know how to do it because I'm speaking as someone who's actually
dollarized two countries. One was Montenegro in 1999 and the other was Ecuador in 2000-2001. And what you need, Adam, is gross
reserves that are positive and greater than the value of the notes and coins outstanding because you have to simply swap the foreign
reserves that you have in your hand with the notes and coins in the domestic currency that you're eliminating, the peso in this case, and
they had gross reserves that exceeded at any reasonable exchange rate. They could have easily exchanged the gross reserves that they had
for the peso notes and coins that they had. And I know this as a matter of theory but I also know it as practice because in Ecuador we
dollarized when we had negative net foreign reserves but we had gross reserves that were greater than the sucre notes and coins that were
outstanding at the exchange rate that was chosen to do the dollarization with. So it was all feasible. He just had bad advice.
Okay. Is it too late or is it something that he could do?
Well, you could do it at any time. I think to pull these chestnuts out of the fire he should do it tomorrow. I mean if he dollarized
tomorrow within 30 days the inflation rate would be down in single digits.
Okay, well here's why this matters so much. Steve, I'm just going to pull up here real quick an index that you create. I'm not sure if you
want a misery index named after yourself but you got one. So I know on your misery index here, Venezuela has
had the top spot for a long time, but Argentina just pushed it off the number one spot here. So if you're not getting these policies
right, they've got real impact for the well-being of your citizens, right?
Absolutely. So I just finished this new misery index and Argentina is the most miserable country in the world. So you say, "Well, how do you
get the misery index? How do you calculate that?" It's simply the inflation rate plus the unemployment rate multiplied by two plus
the lending rate minus the GDP per capita, the change in GDP per capita. So you've got three bad things, high inflation, high
unemployment, and high lending rates, and you've got one good thing in the picture that you subtract out of there, which is the change
in GDP per capita. As it turns out, that actually doesn't help Argentina because even that's negative. They're in a recession. So that
isn't a positive number that you're subtracting. You have a negative number so it's not helping you. So everything they have in the misery
index is bad.
Alright, so Argentina is really in a world of pain right now. Are you optimistic that even if he doesn't dollarize that Malay's reforms will
eventually start pulling that misery down or do you fear it's going to get even worse?
I think if he fails to dollarize, I think he's toast basically. He's not going to be able to get much of anything accomplished.
There's a big gap between rhetoric, his rhetoric, and the reality on the ground because actually he has a very small faction within the
Congress in Argentina and the Congress has already pushed back most of the reforms that he's thrown into the hopper. Now, they would not
be able to do that if he had dollarized and crushed inflation because he would have a lot of credibility, he would have a lot of popular
support because he crushed the main problem in Argentina, which is inflation. And by the way, in that misery index, there are two things
that are related to inflation. One directly is the inflation number but the other is the borrowing cost. Borrowing cost or interest rates
on credit are very related to the rate of increase in the price level or inflation and those two things account for about 95% of the
misery index number for Argentina. So inflation and very high borrowing costs are basically the whole picture.
Okay, so I want to scroll down here. So we've got a misery index of almost 322 for Argentina, running all the way down here to the United
States, which its misery index is only at 16.7%. So you think, okay, we're much better off than the folks are in Argentina, and I think
largely we are, but the two things you just mentioned, inflation and high cost of debt. We had a lot of people watching this video who's
saying, "Yeah, my life's gotten a lot worse because of those two things over the past couple years." So even though we're dramatically
better relatively in misery index score to a place like Argentina, we still feel the effects of those two things pretty strongly.
Well, that is true. However, the misery index, the US rank, you ran down that -- let me just look at my scoring here. I looked at 157
countries, and the US is 132. That 16.7 number that you gave, that puts us in there 132, Israel is 133. So we're the 132nd out of 157.
By the way, the least miserable country is Thailand, that's 157, and then Japan, and then Switzerland, then Qatar, then Malta, then
China. China's 152. China's doing much better than we are. Their misery index is 9.8. Now, one reason that's so low is that inflation is
essentially non-existent in China right now. So coming back to the US, by the way, just a remark, because there's a lot in the press
about this, and that is the misery index score is not all that bad, and things are getting a little bit better. The inflation is coming
down. Economic growth has been strong, the stock market strong and everything, but people have a very negative view of Bidenomics and the
performance of President Biden, and I think the reason for that is twofold. One, they look in the rearview mirror and see what things were
like, maybe three years ago, and they say, "Well, inflation wasn't nearly as bad and the economy was doing good. Unemployment was low."
Everything was a little better.
And things cost 25% less.
Right. Things cost a lot less. The rearview mirror is one thing. The front windshield, looking ahead, is another factor, and they're looking
ahead and saying, "I'm worried," but some of the risks that we talked about at the opening of the show, what's going on in the geopolitical
scene with two wars going on, that the US is financing, by the way. The US is financing that war in Ukraine. It's also financing the one in
Gaza, and then people say, "And what about a recession? Are we really going to keep riding along and sailing along smoothly? Maybe we're
going to have a recession." I think we're going to have a recession, by the way, and the reason I think we're going to have a recession is
that we've had a money supply since March of 2022 that's declined, contracted by 4.5%. Now this kind of contraction, we have to go back to
1929, 1933, Adam, to find a contraction like this, and we only have four contractions since the Federal Reserve was established in 1913 in the
United States, and every one of those has always been followed by recession. So John Greenwood using the quantity theory of money that allowed us
to nail the inflation forecast when things went up to 9.1% in 2021. We use that same thing and we see a recession in the cards, and we also see
inflation, by the way. The good thing, that might be a bad thing, but the good thing is that we anticipate inflation to be around 2% or maybe
below 2% by the end of this year, the consumer price index. So inflation down, the economy probably dipping into recession later this
year, because of what? The contraction in the money supply. Remember, changes in the money supply are the key to the whole thing. That's the fuel for
the economy, the money supply. You got to look at the money supply.
Alright, so you took this exactly where I wanted to take it. I wanted to get to the quantity theory of money. You walked us through the math of
that in previous times I've interviewed you, developed by Milton Friedman, or at least championed by Milton Friedman, and like you said, you
use that to nail the 9% target many, many months before we actually hit it. Like I said, back when you made that 9% prediction when I was
interviewing you then was unthinkable to many people, but yet it played out like you said the math said it would. So that same math tells you
that it's going to be below 2% by the end of the year. And because of the importance of contracting money supply that drives that equation, but that
also drives the economy, and generally as the declining monetary supply leads to declining economic growth, ergo your prediction for a recession.
Yes, and then we go back to the market. We were talking about the market. I said I thought it was a little bit pricey. I prefer a Warren Buffett
kind of cautious backing off, piling up cash in anticipation of a slowdown in the economy because once it slows down, earnings slow down, free cash
flow slows down, and multiples contract, and the market backs off. So that's kind of my general sentiment on the market is it might very well
continue to go up. Remember I said it went up quite a bit higher than it is right now in terms of PE ratios in 1998 to 2000. But of course,
we know what happened after that. After the peak of the PE, it came tumbling down. That was really something that was more related, I would say, to
kind of a bubble type situation.
It was a mania. It was a psychological mania where folks were chasing all the dot com promise.
Right. That was a so called dot com bubble. You've got a little bit of this now, by the way. We had the dot com bubble. Now we have kind of an AI
bubble. AI is going to transform the world. All of a sudden, some people say the potential growth rate in the United States for GDP, now it's about
2.2% and they say, oh, with AI, it'll jump up to 6% or something. I think they're drinking Kool Aid from Silicon Valley to tell you the truth.
This is not going to happen. But there is that, as they say now, they don't call it a story, they call it a narrative. That narrative is swirling
around that we're going to have huge improvements in productivity in the United States and elsewhere because of AI.
And you know what, maybe we do. A lot of the promise of the dot com story or narrative back then did come to play, did come to fruition over time, but it
took a long time. And what happened was so much of the future value was pulled into the present during the mania that price was just pulled way too far
into the future. And so the correction had to happen, but over time, a lot of that promise did get fulfilled. Maybe the same thing will happen with AI,
who knows, but it just seems like a similar pulling in of tomorrow's value to today is happening right now, and that may have to get bled out.
Yeah, well, I agree. A little bit over excitement and unrealistic. I mean, you just don't see those kinds of huge jumps and changes in a country's
potential GDP growth rate. It just doesn't occur.
Alright, interesting. So because I think you expect GDP to slow from here, given the contraction in the money supply, none of this is personal financial
advice, but I would expect that you would probably favor bonds right now, at least maybe US Treasuries, because they're paying a lot more than what I think
you expect inflation to be at the end of the year. A, is that true, and B, might now be a good time to go further out the duration curve to lock in
today's interest rates if you expect inflation to be that low in a year?
Well, the answer is yes, your characterization is correct, because interest rates follow inflation. In other words, inflation, wherever inflation
goes, that leads to changes in the interest rate. So if we go out on the duration, I mean, the key interest rate is a 10 year treasury. So if you go out to the
10 year, I think that's a pretty safe bet for a trade, not necessarily an investment, not something where you take the 10 year and put it in the safety deposit
box and forget about it, but as a trade, I think it will be probably a profitable trade because the interest rate will fall as the inflation rate
continues to fall and goes down to, I think, let's say 2% by the end of the year. If the inflation rate is 2% at the end of the year, believe me, the 10 year
yield is going to be quite a bit lower than it is now. I mean, it's up above 4%, a tad over 4%. It'll drop down and you'll have a pretty good capital
gain. So that's how you want to trade. You want to trade it, not invest in it, is what I'm saying.
Got it. And even if it takes longer than you think for inflation to hit that target, you're still getting paid a positive real return for figuring out
how the story ends.
Absolutely. So I think that's a pretty -- the odds are very much in your favor on being along the 10 year right now.
Okay. Well, since we're talking about inflation and interest rates, what do you expect monetary policy to be for the rest of the year? Do you think
Powell's going to deliver free interest rate cuts? There's a lot of reasons why it optically might be difficult to do that in the short term just with
financial conditions as loose as they are, markets at all time highs, unemployment rate still at quite low readings, and even though there's probably a
lot you and I can talk about, the true health of the employment market might be, or do you think he's eventually going to get the air cover to cut
because inflation is going to moderate the way that you think?
Well, if history is a guide, the Fed right now is focused very much on the labor market and what's going on in the labor market. Now, that happens to be a
lagging indicator. Things happen in the labor market after economic activity starts changing. So if you go into a recession, what happens? You don't lay
off your people and get rid of them right away. You hold on to them because you've usually invested a lot in their human capital development and so
forth. You don't like to get rid of labor.
Right. Sorry to interject, but they always say generals fight the last war. On the labor side, we laid off 40 million people during COVID, and then
companies had to go back and hire those people back really quickly and realized how painful it was to lay somebody off and then if a scrambler
bring them back on. So they're remembering the pain of that, which is why they're hoarding talent so much.
Oh, absolutely. There's no question about it. Let's just walk through this scenario. The Fed is and historically has, in these situations, looked very
carefully at the labor market, and the labor market won't start really deteriorating seriously until the economy is already tanking. So if we go into
recession, what's going to happen? The labor market will tank a lot with a big lag relative to what's really going on in the economy and profits and
everything else. So they'll be late to the game. So I think they will pivot eventually, because if we do go into a recession, which I think we will go into,
the labor market will eventually start deteriorating, and at that time, the Fed will take action, but it'll all be too late. So as a result of this, you get
this roller coaster ride up and down, up and down with the Fed. That's the basic problem with the Fed. They're not looking at the right thing. They're
ignoring changes in the growth rate in the money supply. To hit the inflation target in the United States of 2%, and to keep things on an even keel, the rate of
growth in the money supply measured by M2 should be about 6% per year, Adam, and now it's about year over year negative 2%.
2%. So I think I told you this before we hopped on, your outlook for declining inflation because of the contracting money supply and then concerns
about recession, you're right there with Lacy Hunt. So it's good company to be in there. I also hear you're saying it's not different this time, the script is
probably going to follow the way that it has in recent history where I think for the past recessions and living memory, like the past four or five, they've all
been preceded by a rate hike campaign by the Fed, then we plateau for a while, and then we hit recession and then the Fed is cutting desperately, but it's
because it's behind the curve and it's trying to catch up to what's going on. Sounds like you see something very similar is likely ahead in the future.
Well, yes. I do and remember again, you're talking about interest rates here, but monetary policy is not about interest rates, it's about changes in the money supply.
It's focusing on the money supply. So that's another reason why I have a very cautious stance right now and I'm not an enthusiast about the market.
The market's going up, up, up, and I'm kind of not on that bandwagon.
Got it. I'm definitely detecting caution from you. So I asked you about monetary policy. Let's go to fiscal policy. So the Fed is actually -- I want to say
they've been showing restraint because they've hiked interest rates so aggressively and they're doing QT. Now they've been doing other things that provide
liquidity to the markets, like the drawdown of the reverse repo program and some of the stuff they did with the BTFP, but in parallel, you've had the fiscal
side of the equation just going full drunken sailor. We've got massive deficits as a percentage of GDP. It's levels we only see during like world wars.
So what do you expect from the fiscal side going forward, especially in an election year?
I don't think things are going to change very much.
And what will that do to the economy? Will it short-term stimulate the economy still?
No, people are always confused about this. If you look at fiscal policy and monetary policy, monetary dominates
and it always dominates.
In your answer, can you address fiscal dominance? Because there are a lot of people that are saying that we're in a period of fiscal dominance,
which people are thinking, "Okay, that means that fiscal policy is more important."
Well, there's nothing in the historical record to indicate that that's true, either in the United States or anyplace else.
And one thing that's tricky about looking at it, to really find unambiguous cases that people can understand,
you've got to find situations where the fiscal and monetary policies are going in opposite directions,
and then you can figure out which ones dominating.
Who wins that tug of war?
That's the only way to do it without getting out in the weeds with econometric studies and so forth that most people don't understand.
So when we look at the United States, when did we have a super tight fiscal policy and I wouldn't say it was excessive monetary policy,
but moderate monetary policy, reasonable monetary policy, they were essentially going in opposite directions.
It was in the Clinton administration. It was in the 1990s. Clinton, most people don't realize, since World War II,
Clinton was the most fiscally conservative president in the United States, by far.
Reagan was, Eisenhower was, but Clinton was really on steroids.
Remember, the last two years of the Clinton administration, we were actually running surpluses.
Yeah, we had that blip of a surplus, yeah.
So you had very tight fiscal policy and the fiscalists would say, "Oh, that's going to drag the economy down.
It's going to slow things down." On the other hand, Greenspan was the chairman of the Fed and the monetary policy was rolling along.
It was a pretty steady rate of growth, reasonable, but it was positive and reasonable and what dominated money.
And if you go to other cases around the world where you get these extremes where the fiscal is going one way and the monetary is going
another way, the monetary always wins.
All right, so monetary always wins. Does that mean that what's going on fiscally is kind of irrelevant for the rest of this year?
Well, it's not irrelevant because if it's out there and you have a big fiscal deficit, it's potentially dangerous because what
might happen is what happened in 2020-2021 when the Fed was the one buying all the treasuries and monetizing the deficit.
And when they did that, of course, that increased the rate of growth in the money supply.
That's why the money supply shot up. In its peak, it was growing about 27% year over year, the money supply, and that's because of why.
That was because the Fed was buying about 90% of all the treasuries that were being issued with that ballooning deficit that was occurring.
Right now they're not doing that. As you indicated, they're engaged in quantitative tightening, so they're not buying the treasuries.
They're running off treasuries off their balance sheet and that's one reason, by the way, that the money supply growth is contracting.
It's anemic and it's actually below that 6% hanky's golden growth rate that would be consistent with hitting a 2% inflation target.
It's a negative 2%. It's not a positive 6, but that's because the imperative quantitative tightening.
So what are the odds of us, if that doesn't change, if we stay at that negative 2%, what are the odds of us actually maybe flipping into
deflation at some point in 2025 or 2026? Oh, we could in 2025. If the contraction year over year continues at -2% for much longer, we could
very well see an outright deflation in 2025. And I'm guessing that's why Powell has recently been jawboning about, hey, at the Fed we're
talking about reducing QT. He hasn't said ending it yet but reducing it because I got to imagine with the reverse repo program being set to
hit zero, that's kind of been an offset to a lot of QT. Without that, then you really feel the bite of the QT, correct?
Now you're talking and thinking logically, but the Fed is not logical, Adam. They're not looking at the money supply. You and I are talking
about the money supply and we're talking about the credit counterparts that explain why the money supply goes up and goes down. That's our
conversation. But the Fed has been adamant that they don't think there's a reliable linkage between changes in the money supply and changes in
economic activity or changes in inflation. That is the position of the Fed. So whatever they're looking at, they're data dependent. So they
basically have their finger in the wind. They're looking at all the data that come out day after day after day and trying to decide what in the
world to do. And most of the data that come out, they're all lagging indicators. Now the reason that that's dangerous, if you think in terms of
the quantity theory of money, and I said the fuel for the economy is the money supply. So we get changes in the money supply happening and
then with long and variable lags, other things happen. Asset prices change. We get changes in economic activity. We get changes in inflation.
But those come way after the changes in the money supply that have happened. So if you're data dependent, you're looking at data today that has
been caused to move around because of something that happened a year and a half ago or maybe two years ago or maybe even three years ago.
All right, so this is obviously why the Fed is chronically behind the curve. You expect them to continue to be behind the curve going forward. So
you're talking about something that I mentioned on this channel all the time, so I'd love just to clarify your point of view on it. I talk about the lag
effect and it's a lonely conversation in today's world because the narrative has moved on to it doesn't matter. It's different this time. We had the
most aggressive hiking regime along with quantitative tightening, and it hasn't mattered, and so it's not going to matter. So forget about hard
landings. Forget about soft landings. We're going to have a no landing scenario going forward. It sounds to me like you feel like, nope, the lag
effect is real. Maybe it's been delayed by certain things, rising liquidity, whatever, but it's going to manifest. Is that an accurate summary?
Yes, it is, and the only thing I would add to the long lag is that we have found that these lags are highly variable too, so it's a very tricky
thing to get into precise forecasts of what's going to happen because the lags between changes in the money supply and changes in economic
activity, they're not only long but they're variable. In other words, it's not some off the shelf kind of formula that, oh, the money supply surges
and we know that in 18 months the economy will surge. It's not like that. Maybe it'll surge in six months. Maybe it'll take two years. Maybe it'll
take even three years. So you have to be watching everything all the time. It's fine to be watching the data, but you've got to have this lag
thing in your picture. Otherwise, you're just going to be looking at noise, basically. If you don't look at the source of what's changing these data day
to day, which always goes back to the fuel, the fuel for the economy is money.
Alright, and when did the money supply start tipping negative?
I will tell you exactly. The year-over-year number started tipping in December of 2022. It was slowing down big time before that, but the
year-over-year number went negative in December 2022, and if we look at the three-month annualized rate, that went negative in June of 2022.
Okay, so it sounds like what you're saying is the big lag effect to try to figure out here is the lag effect from when money supply started to
shrink. And it's been shrinking now for a year and a half on a year-over-year basis. So in other words, it's not a blip we have to worry about in
the data series. It's an ongoing trend. So at some point, that lag effect will catch up with us, and presumably the longer that the money supply
continues to contract, the bigger whatever that lag effect from it's going to be whenever it arrives is going to last for a long time.
Right, and now you've set this thing up beautifully the way you've explained it. It's very clear. The one thing in the picture, remember, that in
2020, early 2021, we got a huge explosion in the money supply, and that puts, shall we say, a lot of excess cash balances in the system, and that
has only now been drained out of the system. The excess cash balances, that would be M2 divided by GDP. That's the cash balances. So that's been
drained out. That's come down to about the trend rate right now, and what that means is it pushes the lag out. If that big balloon of excess
cash money hadn't been in the system, we probably would be in the tank right now.
So Steve, I've used this analogy so much on this channel that folks are sick of it, which is that all that stimulus you're talking about, that's the pig in
the Python. We shoved this massive pig into the Python. It's taken a long time to get through it. What you're saying now is making me think of
another analogy, which is after the Python swallowed the pig, somebody put a grenade in its mouth. So we have to wait for the pig to get through
the Python, which is almost done, but at some point that grenade is coming through the Python and is eventually going to go off and that's going
to be the period of whatever negative stimulus is, this shortfall.
Instead of the grenade analogy, you could say with the negative, the pig has gone out and now you also have leakage in the system.
Or maybe not a grenade. The body fluids in the Python are leaking away. Or it's going to say maybe instead of a grenade, they put a big pill of a
Zempic in the Python and so it's now going to get a lot skinnier. Yeah, right. That's exactly what's happening. It's going to get a lot skinnier and we can anticipate
seeing this on the scene, I think, the second half of this year. It's going to start showing up. You can see it now if you slice and dice
everything. There's kind of a little weakness showing up here and there, but you'll start seeing it to be more pronounced a little bit later this year.
Last point on this and then we'll start wrapping it up. Given the size of this Zempic pill, which is not a tiny pill, it's a decent size one because you
said the money supply has been contracting now for a year and a half and it's still ongoing. Does that mean if we start seeing the impact of the lag
effects from this, say, by the end of the year, second half of the year, whatever, do you expect a prolonged period of us having to deal with this?
So maybe does 2025 kind of look like prolonged recession? Well, it obviously depends on what the Fed does from now through the end of the year
because, again, with the lag in 2025, what happens in 2024 is relevant. What happens to the money supply? It depends on what's going on in the money
supply and we don't know. Are they going to stop QT? Is something going to happen that actually causes them to ease up?
No. It doesn't look like that. It doesn't look like it at least until June that they're going to do anything. Right. If you look at the federal funds
futures market, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, they have the first reduction in Fed funds and let's say loosening up coming in June.
Right. A modest amount. Not a radical change, but just the market is pricing in a modest loosening up starting early in the summer.
Right. And of course, the market's been wrong for a year, over a year, in terms of what the Fed's going to do. It was always pricing in a pivot
earlier this year. It was pricing in seven rate cuts this year. Oh yeah, but they listen to Paul and if you listen to him and you're data dependent
like the markets, you change your perspective on where you think the Fed's going to be going.
Alright, so let me put it this way. Unless the Fed takes somewhat drastic action this year, it seems like you think 2025 is going to be a rough
year economically. Yes. Okay. Alright, so in just wrapping it up here, Steve, we talked about a lot of the challenges, a lot of things not being
done right from a policy standpoint, a lot of the problems we have. I actually didn't even get to this point, but I'm going to just mention it.
The US Congressional Budget Office's latest long term predictions indicate that by 2044, interest costs will be greater than all discretionary
government spending combined. We've got a massive debt problem in this country that seems to only be getting worse. That's a whole probably other
discussion for us, but the concluding question I want to ask you on this general topic is if I made you king hanky, emperor hanky, what reforms
would you prioritize right now? Oh, it does get into this budget because what you just said is that the Congressional Budget Office is saying
that there's a fundamental structural problem with the public finances in the United States, and either you change the structure and you cap
government spending in some way or we're going to have to increase taxes tremendously to pay for this. One of the two, and I'm for a debt break,
a Swiss style debt break, and the Swiss put in a debt break, they made a constitutional change after having a referendum, and the debt break basically
says that the government spending in Switzerland can't go up any faster than the rate of real GDP growth. So the government can't crowd out the
private sector, and they must in the intermediate period, one, two, three years, actually two, three, something like that, balance the budget.
That's the Swiss debt break. Now the only way you can do that in the United States is to have a constitutional amendment, and that means you have to
invoke article five of the Constitution, which I'm for, and having a constitutional convention to look specifically and narrowly at the fiscal
situation, and the idea of putting some kind of debt break in that would restructure the government's finances. It would make the structural
change that you would have to have to control things, and if you don't do that, we're going to be in for very heavy taxes.
Alright, so I think what would happen there is it would constrain economic growth. The economy may not grow as much because it's not being debt
fueled, but the better part of that story is we wouldn't get into all the solvency issues that would then require all those drastic measures
you're talking about. I love that idea. I think the odds of it being enacted are very low, at least proactively by today's politicians.
Statutorily, you could have -- let's look at the two options. One is to do this with statutes, and those have always failed. Every time we've had a
statute, Graham Rudman, for example, that worked for a couple years. It was kind of like a Band-Aid, but the statutory changes on the
fiscal front do not work. You've got to do a constitutional change, not a statutory, and the constitutional requires a constitutional
convention under article five, and I'm on the board, actually, of an organization that is pushing this and moving it forward, and we
might very well, I hope, have a constitutional convention on this topic, and that would change the structure on the fiscal front and cap
things and save us from what will be essentially punishing taxes, either inflation taxes or real out-of-the-pocket type taxes, one of the
two. You're going to get taxed one way or another, either with an inflation tax or paying Uncle Sam every April a larger chunk than
you've been paying in the past.
Well, Godspeed to you on that, Steve, and I think I speak for the vast majority, if not all the people watching this video, and if there's any way
that my viewers can help or support or participate in that, please let them know how to do so. On that note, too, Steve, as we wrap things up
here, for folks that have really enjoyed this conversation and would like to follow you in your work, where should they go?
They can follow me on Twitter, just @steve_hanky, and right now I'm rated the third most influential economist in the world with this
Twitter following.
Third most influential, but number one in our hearts, Steve.
Yeah, well, absolutely, and the other way, of course, just write me an email, hanky@jhu.edu, and I'll put you on my regular distribution
list or if you have some question, I'll try to answer it.
You're very courageous to share your email publicly. Thanks for that, and Steve, for better or worse, when I edit this, I will put up the
links to your Twitter handle and your email there. Expect your email inbox to explode. Folks, I'll have links to those in the description
below the video here. Alright, Steve, in the last minute we have here, just in wrapping up, we've been talking about sort of financially
related money-related issues, this whole conversation. What's one non-money-related investment of time, energy, focus, whatever you would
encourage people to consider adopting in their lives?
Well, speaking as a man, I think the critical thing is that choice you make when you decide to marry someone, and fortunately I made the right one.
That is a great answer. I'm shocked that actually I've had a lot of people mention sort of relationships and whatnot, but choice of
life partner has not come up yet, and I think that's a phenomenal answer. My wife is a marriage family therapist, so I kind of almost
have to say that as her spouse, and having married a great spouse, I totally agree with you. And of course, there's everything from
personal happiness and whatnot for making the right choice, but even just the dollars and cents of it, I think the data is really clear
that one of the better catalysts you can have in your life for financial well-being is actually having a good supportive spouse, correct?
Absolutely. There's no question about it. In my case, Mrs. Hanke and I collaborated across the board on everything, including, by the way,
what we're talking about, political economy, especially the geopolitical aspects of the thing. She comes in heavy duty. At one point in
her life, she was a professor also at Johns Hopkins, teaching at Johns Hopkins, literary criticism. Since then, she's made a switch over
into geopolitics. Well, you are a wealthy man in many different ways, Steve. Great answer. Thank you so much for coming on the program.
I really appreciate it. Look forward to having you back on later this year, anytime you want to come on, especially if something on the
dashboard that you monitor really starts flashing in a way you want to get out in the world, but can't thank you enough. It's been such a
pleasure to have you back on. Well, thanks for having me, Adam. Good to be with you again. Thank you.
All right. Well, now's the time of the program where we bring in the lead partners from New Harbor Financial, one of the financial advisors
endorsed by thoughtful money to come on. We'll react quickly to the great discussion we just had there with Steve, but they'll also tell us
what's been on their radar over the past week as we've just finished up this barn burner of a Q1. I'm joined as usual by lead partners,
John Lodra and Mike Preston. Guys, thanks so much for joining. Mike, what do you have to think about the conversation there with Steve?
Hey, Adam. It was a great talk with Steve. Steve basically started off the talk. He asked him what he thought about the global financial
markets. He said, "Well, we're sailing pretty smoothly right now, but we've got two wars going on and a lot of uncertainty, and we have
the market at a very pricey level." He said we were at a price-to-earnings ratio of 30. I'm not sure exactly which price-to-earnings ratio he
was using, but that's in the ballpark, depending upon which way you look at it. The Shiller price-earnings ratio is even higher up in
the mid to high 30s. If you look at the price-earnings ratio on a 10-year smooth basis, like the Shiller PE ratio, it's a lot more
reliable. It shows that we're at nosebleed levels. We've never been here except for at the very top in 1999 and 2000 and 1929. He
said right about at that point in the talk that he likes to sit in cash and wait for the crash. I like how that rhymed. That's not what
we're doing exactly here at New Harbor, but we're doing some of that in that we have a little over 40% cash equivalent still. We've
made a lot of changes in our portfolio the last couple of months, which we'll talk about probably later in this talk. When Steve
said sit in cash and wait for the crash, like Warren Buffett does, and Warren Buffett, by the way, has something like it's either
180 billion or 280 billion in cash. I can't remember which it was, but it's a record high for Berkshire Hathaway too. Professional
investors are seeing this. He talked about the money supply. I think he said, Milton Friedman said, "Inflation is a money
supply situation." If you can enable sharing, Adam, I'm just going to share a chart of the money supply. He said the money
supply peaked in 2022 and it's been trending down. That indeed is true, but it hasn't really been much of a move. I'm just
going to show it here quickly if I can. This is the St. Louis Fed website. For the people that don't know, you can go here to
fred.stlouisfed.org. There's a whole bunch of different charts here put out by the Federal Reserve themselves. But M2 money
supply went from around 15, 16 trillion. That was right as COVID started. We went from 15 to 20 or even higher, maybe 14 to
21. The money supply exploded by 50% in one year during COVID. That's another way of saying that one out of every $3 in
existence during that time was created in that year, which is pretty crazy.
And sorry to interrupt, but because of the quantity formula of money, that's why Steve was so confident in making that 9%
inflation prediction call way back when because he saw that surge in the money supply and just put that into the equation
and said, "Oh, because of money supply increased by this much, inflation is going to have to increase by that much."
It was insane. Obviously, we had inflation. Inflation went right to 9% and I bonds were paying 9%. It felt like that was
going to last forever. Well, we've actually trended down pretty smoothly into the maybe 4% range or so. But Steve said we
peaked in 22 in the money supply. He's right. We did right here. But you really have to kind of squint to see the
reduction. So I'm not sure that I see or that I'm as confident as he is, but he's obviously the expert in this
field and I'm not, but it's not really a big drop after what we've seen here. So we'll see if that actually does feed
through and creates a recession. He thinks that we're going to see a recession next year. I heard him say at the end of
the talk, unless the Fed does something big, but he thinks they're going to be late. And we agree, they're probably
going to be late to the party, they're going to wait for some kind of crash or big drop in the market, and then
they're going to do something. Even though the dot plot shows some minor changes this year, maybe as many as three
interest rate cuts, I think they're going to be very, very slow. And, you know, the markets anticipating them
already, there's certainly not going to be large resounding rate cuts that one would expect to see in response to a
panic. So again, he reiterated the changes in money supply are the key to everything. We'll see. And he said the 10
year yield, he thinks he's going to have to be under pressure, particularly if we have this recession, and the Fed has
to respond, even if it's late to the game, even if they've got to respond to the 10 year yield should go down. And he
thinks that buying 10 year bonds here makes a lot of sense. We agree. It may take a while to respond, because in
investments like TLT is still hanging around in the mid 90s, and the 10 year yield is still at around 4.2. But the 10
year yield should go down towards 3% again, when the Fed reacts and when we have some kind of big downturn in the
market. So we agree that being invested in long term bonds, he said the 10 year but even longer bonds can make a lot of
sense. So I think I'll stop there and take a pause and give John a chance to say something.
John, we'll come to you in just one sec. One thing I just want to note is of the topics, there's a whole slew of experts
that come on this channel every week, right? And they all have different viewpoints of different outlooks. I would say
the majority of them are concerned about overstretched market valuations are concerned about things like the lag
effects and eventually the economy slowing down and recession being in the mix somewhere in the future. But I would say
that one of the things that I see the greatest disagreement on amongst the folks that I talked to is inflation. I've
definitely got a fair amount of people and they're like, hey, it's going to be just inflation is going to be secularly
higher going forward, interest rates are going to be higher going forward than we've been used to. I had some on last
week, delivering that message. And then we have folks like Steve Henke, or Lacey Hunt, or Stephanie Pomboy, or whatnot,
who are saying, look, no, we think that disinflation and really deep, eventually deflation is the bigger thing to worry
about. Lacey, if you watched his keynote presentation from the recent spring conference we just did two weeks ago, he
walked through a zillion charts explaining this in great depth, going into the money, the shrinking money supply and all that
stuff. So it's going to be really interesting. That's one where it seems like there's going to be real winners on the side of
that bet and real losers on the side of that bet. And according to Steve, we're not going to have too much longer to wait to
find out. By the end of this year, it really should be pretty clear who's won that bet. So anyway, it's going to be
interesting. John, let me hand it over to you. Anything you want to add to what Mike just said there?
Yeah, sure. I too really enjoyed Steve's comments. He's a very astute analyst and I like his style. I actually had a chart handy.
I was given the privilege to be a guest speaker at a Bentley University class last week, I think it was. Mostly seniors,
college seniors. So it was really exciting thing for me. I got to do a little bit of an Adam Taggart educational give back to
the world kind of thing. So it was really a much smaller scale. It's probably 30 people in the class.
It's okay. I'm sure you sounded a lot smarter.
I don't know about that. But it was great because I was able to bring some of these charts that we oftentimes obsess over
into the classroom of the next generation. And I actually had one on Steve talked about the money supply as a percent of
GDP as kind of a key thing. Mike just brought up the M2 chart, which is shocking in its own right. In some ways, it's more
shocking if you look at it on the metric that Steve talked about. So I'll just share that. Again, I had this chart from that
talk I gave. And as sharp as the rise that Mike showed on a percentage of GDP basis, it was actually quite a bit more
shocking. I mean, that is like as vertical as you can get. Now, the pullback, Steve's talked about the drain of money
supply as money M2 over GDP. It has been a little bit more pronounced on that basis as compared to if you look at just GDP.
But I want to just kind of have that chart in handy. That is pretty dramatic. You look at this chart goes back to the '60s.
You know, range bound there, you know, '50s, maybe '55, '60%. There's late '90s, it got pretty low. But look at over the last
in response to the great financial crisis and then COVID. I mean, it's just off the charts absurd compared to what history
would have talked about. Just a couple other charts, maybe I'll just throw in that I had handy. He talked about if he was king,
he would institute a rule like I think he said Switzerland put in place that debt can't grow faster than GDP. Well, this is
what our debt to GDP chart looks like here in the US. You know, we've crossed that over and it's been accelerating. Now, if you
look at a percentage basis, yeah, the rate has maybe declined recently, but look at that little uptick there. So I would vote for
him as king if that was the one pillar of things to consider.
Me too. And John, go back and pull up the debt to GDP chart there. Just the absolute value of both. So this is the absolute value of both
of those numbers, right? So the debt is now bigger than GDP. But if this were a map of the growth rates of debt versus GDP, debts been
growing faster than GDP since pretty much the mid 70s. And that's basically this chart. Anytime the slope here is increasing,
that's basically saying the debt is growing faster. Yeah, you're absolutely right. That's a pretty upward sloping line with a couple of
pretty pauses. Yeah, but it just means for, and it looks like it's really the early 80s is when it really started taking off. But for most
people who are watching this video, it's been the entirety of their adult life. So what we think of as normal is this period of debts
growing faster than our national debt growing faster than our income, which is essentially if you're a household that's like growing
your debts faster than your household income, which is, yeah, it feels great. You feel wealthier because you've got money to spend,
but there's a piper to be paid at some point in the future. That you point out, yeah, the debt did start taking off in the 80s. That's also
when a 40-year decline in interest rates started. So the ability to take on more debt had this huge tailwind. Are we going to have
another 40-year tailwind of declining interest rates from where we are now? I don't think so, at least certainly not to the same degree.
So we're in a brand new environment. And one of the other things I had to inform the Bentley students about is I told them to look at their
pay stubs. I put up a screen of a mock pay stub and it said, what are these FICA things? And I showed that and I said, this is you paying your
share of government programs. And oh, by the way, this next slide is right off of the social security website that 2034, the fund is going to be
unable to pay full promises. So yeah, we've got some things we're running towards here that can be kicked down the road decades like it was before.
So I'm curious, John, how you do this, because I have to speak to lots of audiences on this stuff. And you want to make the audience aware of the
reality of the situation and talking to younger audiences, it's even more important for them to become aware because they're the ones that are
going to have to live the longest in this future that's coming. And you can make the biggest differences in their lives if they make good
changes now. But how do you have that conversation without just crushing their optimism for their future?
Yeah, I was very concerned about that. I kind of put it in the context of this isn't going to fix itself. Your generation has a lot of power
here, especially when you think about voting. And I told them that politicians aren't leaders, they're followers, you just got to make them
follow you. And the only way you do that is by demanding more. You can't be passive in the arena when it comes to politics. You got to vote is a
simple thing. Even if you think it doesn't matter, if you take that attitude, you're going to have a lifestyle of thinking things don't matter.
You got to do those little things like voting, if you're going to do the big things right. So yeah, it was a tricky message. But look, we all
deserve truth and especially our young folks. Yeah, you have to have it. You don't do anybody any favors by sugarcoating it. I always just find
it is a challenging art to be able to be honest, to hold their attention and to not just completely demoralize them. And I'm not saying I'm
perfect at it. So I'm just curious how you feel to that. All right, well, look, in the remaining few minutes, we have your guys. So we just
finished a Q1 where pretty much everything went up. The dollar went up, gold went up. Maybe bond prices didn't go up so much, but bond yields
went up a bit. The S&P went up by a lot. The Nasdaq went up by a lot. The Russell 2000 went up by a lot. Bitcoin went up by a lot. Kind of
everything we can think of practically has gone up. So from the casual observers perspective, what's there to worry about? This is like
best environment ever. Strong GDP growth, low unemployment, easy to make money in the markets. I want to give you guys a chance to react in
any way to that as capital managers right now, because my sense is you're not taking the current market environment as a signal to go whole hog
and go long everything. Mike, let's go to you.
No, absolutely not. I mean, you're right. Everything is up. Everything's at all-time highs. It's pretty surreal, actually. The market's been up,
I don't know, 15, 16 or 17 weeks out of the last 18 or it's been down maybe one or two weeks. It's been a relentless up move, but it has been
persistent and relentless. And we can't deny the indicators that continually point upwards. And the problem is it's like
a pressure cooker just continues to build pressure and pressure and pressure. And that pressure is up for now, but it becomes ever more
unpredictable as the trend continues. And that's what's tough for individual investors. And that's what's tough for us. We're using our
tools the best we can to participate and have good risk controls on board. We're somewhere around the low 40s, 40 something
percent, depending upon the account. Exposed to equities, we've got some really good tight hedges on board. We have the had the
ability to adjust those hedges. Just yesterday or the day before we adjusted one of our hedges on the S&P. We had moved
previously from 4,500 to 4,700 on the S&P. We just moved it up further to the to the 4,900 level. So as the market goes up, we keep
moving that floor up little by little, because it costs us less and less to do so as that market goes up. But the S&P
finished the first quarter up 10%, huge up quarter. And I just read somewhere, something like 94% of the time, when the
first quarter is up, then the S&P is up for the year. I don't think you can rely on those things, particularly not in an
election year. But it was a really strong quarter. And it's been straight up since October of last year. But you know what
else is at an all time high? Gold. Gold is up 8% roughly for the year to date. And it's got a massive breakout on a long
term chart that we've been talking about so often here. Bitcoin is at an all time high. Everything's on an all time high,
real estate, everything across the board. So pretty frustrating as a money manager, and as an individual investor, but we
have a system. And we do have exposure in the 40s, like I said.
Yeah. Sorry to interrupt you there, but just to help you explain the cognitive dissonance that might be in some
viewers minds, where you're saying everything's at an all time high that's frustrating as a money manager. I think a lot
of people be like, what do you mean? You should be like partying.
The reason is we don't have a static allocation. If we just put people in the market and let it sit there over time, it
would feel great right now. And maybe we'd be a little nervous as it keeps going up. But we know it's not real. We know
that a good part of what we're seeing here is not going to stay. It's an illusion, so to speak. And this market can and
will turn and probably wipe away many years of gains. It's happened twice already in my career. It's happened twice
already in the last 25 years. The tech crash, the housing crash, this one should be bigger if it ever happens, if it's
ever allowed to happen. So that's why it's frustrating. Those that know the truth, that can see the data, that are
trying to educate people are frustrated because we're trying to get a little bit of gain, and we are, but we don't want
to give up that much if we crash from here. We have to accept something, a few percent of the downside. But for the most
part, we're trying to get some very conservative gains and give up very little on the term.
All right. And again, we've talked a lot in the past about your risk management tools, so we won't go into them in detail
now. But you talked a bit about how you keep erasing the hedges that you have on your portfolios as the market goes up,
which is what gives you the ability to sleep at night while you're along in this market, where if there's a big
downdraft that comes out of the blue, like you fear could happen at some point, you've got the insurance in place, you've
got that safety net in place to minimize your downside risk. John, I'm coming to you here. I just want to give you one thing
to react to, which is, I talked to a lot of people. I've been doing this now for three years. And nobody has a crystal
ball. So a lot of people have outlooks that have not panned out exactly the way they thought they would. And that's more
than norm, because the future is unknowable. But I do like to shine a light where somebody really nailed a prediction. And I
talk about like how Darius Dale coming into Q4, coming into Q1 said his model was the most bullish he'd ever seen it that
thought Q1 was going to be great. Well, Q1 turned out to be great. So I like to give Darius props for that. Steve really
nailed that 9% inflation prediction at a time where it was, like I said, really hard to believe. And he did it with math,
right? He's an economist, and he pulled up the quantity theory money, and he walked us all through the why and how of each of
the inputs and said, hey, since money supplies increased by this much, inflation is going to have to increase by this much
going forward. And the formula was right. So I think you have to take with a lot of respect, the prediction of that same
formula going forward now that money supply is shrinking, right? And if so, then, you know, Steve says, look, unless the Fed
goes bananas quickly on the rescue side of things, we're highly likely going to have some sort of contraction in the
economy, you know, probably as soon as the end of this year, early next year. So, you know, how do you guys take that into account
in your management strategy for your client's wealth going forward?
Well, one thing we can say with 100% confidence is that in the short term, the market can and oftentimes will do things that are
completely at odds with what the fundamentals should say, will be candid, we're more invested in stocks right now than from a
fundamental standpoint, we would otherwise want to be. And why is that? Because many of the technical indicators that we
follow, which technical indicators are more or less a kind of code word for psychology and investor psychology behavior,
whether it makes sense or not, sometimes it's downright insane. So some of the data that you know, folks like
Steve pointed to, you know, really, for us set the backdrop for what kind of risk controls makes sense to have, even if in the
short term, we may be positioning in ways that we think are at odds with the bigger picture fundamentals. So for example, just
late last week, we added a slice of a position long equities in the Russell 2000. It's an index that has lagged, but there was a
pretty, pretty convincing breakout there and again, relative strength and things like that. But we did so with very tight
hedges. We did a collar position that over 50 days, it has a 50 day life has upside potential of about 4%, with a downside
risk of no more than 3%. Right? So very contained risk. We think in the short term, given some of the technicals, we're
likely to see more upside than downside. But if we get completely wrong there, first of all, our position size is very
small, but we've we've got these code options that we fully paid for and then some by taking in premium by selling the call.
So we feel very comfortable straddling that line. But make no mistake about it, we wouldn't have been comfortable adding a
bigger position or one without the belt suspenders that we've had. So yeah, I mean, kudos. I mean, it's Steve, Steve certainly
was a lonely. He was making that call at a time when everybody that had a pulpit was saying this is transitory, the Fed
included. And yeah, it came back to you can't just do these things without at some point having consequence. They're not
perfect indicators. He himself pointed out that the lag effects are oftentimes long and variable, but they're still there. And
you have to be cognizant of that and understand that you can't be perfect. But the consequences of being imperfect and on the
wrong side of things are far greater than being imperfect and on the right side of things in the big picture.
All right. Well said. All right. Well, look, we'll have to start wrapping it up here, guys. Folks watching a couple of quick things.
One, if you enjoyed the conversation here with Steve would like for Steve to come back on the program, please let him know that by
hitting the like button, then clicking on the red subscribe button below, as well as that little bell icon right next to it. And as I
think, Steve, but certainly John and Mike have really been emphasizing here, it's a tricky time, especially for the average
investor who's just trying to make sense of what's going to happen next in these markets. And you've got the current FOMO raging
mania that's going on, but also the very sobering warnings that Steve for sure is ringing. Of course, a lot of other folks on this
channel are ringing similar versions of it. And most people, you've got real lives, families, jobs, and stuff to focus on, and whatever
happens, you just don't want to become collateral damage to it. So I highly recommend that the vast majority of people who are watching
this shouldn't go it along and just try to sort of figure it out, groping in the dark. You should be working under the guidance of a good
professional financial advisor who takes into account all the issues that Steve and I talked about that John and Mike have mentioned
here, and then puts together a personalized strategy for you and then executes it for you. If you've got a good one who's doing that, great,
you should stick with them. But if you don't, or you'd like a second opinion from one who does, maybe even John and Mike and their team
here from New Harbor Financial, then consider scheduling a free consultation with one of the financial advisors that Thoughtful Money
endorses. To do that, just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com, fill out the short form there, only takes a couple of seconds. You then get a fully
personalized bespoke consultation with the advisor that you get matched with or that you indicate you want to talk to. These consultations
are totally free. There's no commitment to work with these guys. It's just a free public service they offer to help as many people as possible,
positioned as prudently as possible today for what might be coming down the road. John and Mike, thanks so much again, guys, for hanging with me
for yet another week. Maybe next week we can do, if gold continues its breakout here, as you've been predicting for a long time, guys,
especially you, Mike, maybe we can do a deeper dive into that and the miners specifically, because it looks like that complex, which has been
much hated for very long, may be showing some signs of life right now. But we'll save that for next week. Guys, look forward to whatever happens
between now and then, you guys making it sense for everybody here and everybody else who's been watching. Thanks so much for watching.
And thank you, Adam. We'll see you next week.
Thank you again, Adam. See you soon.
