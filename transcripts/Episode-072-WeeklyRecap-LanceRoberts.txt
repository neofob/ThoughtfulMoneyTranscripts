Welcome to thoughtful money, I'm thoughtful money founder and your host Adam Taggart here
with you at the end of yet another week with my good friend, industrious portfolio manager
Lance Roberts.
Lance, how you doing?
I'm hanging in there lost my voice on Wednesday, and I'm just now starting to get it back.
So you'll have to just bear with me being a little bit croaky today.
So and hopefully I can get through a little bit of this before I lose it again.
So let's just see what we get done today.
All right, and folks, we're going to keep this one a little shorter than normal one
both to save Lance's voice to I am on vacation, as you can tell by the background.
And I've got a family that is waiting for me to finish this recording so that we can
head out and enjoy our day.
Lance, I picked industrious because I'm on vacation while you sadly are back in the salt
mines.
It's been a it's been another week, another week, another all time high in the markets.
So we certainly got some questions for you about the market action because you have been
saying, you know, over the past number of weeks now that yeah, risk of a pullback is
getting higher and higher, the longer the elastic band keeps getting stretched like
this.
Now, obviously, if we hang out for long enough at this point, it gives the moving averages
time to catch up what's winning out right now, the price appreciation or the catch up
of the moving averages,
the price appreciation, we haven't, you know, we kind of look like that we were starting
to maybe do a little bit of topping over the last week, previous to Wednesday.
And the market had kind of been starting that that angle of ascent had started to slow down
just a bit and look like maybe we're going to start to consolidate but then on Wednesday,
the much more dovish FOMC meeting came out and the markets rocketed to all time highs,
which negated any of that process.
So you know, you could not really create a much better, I'm working on sharing a screen
here.
So just bear with me one second.
If you take a look at this trend channel, only Bernie Madoff could come up with a chart
like this, you know, for managing money.
You know, it's the market dips to the 20 day moving average, the computer algorithms step
in, they buy those dips to the 20 day, you rally to the top of the trend channel like
we did yesterday, and the market fails, and we're a little bit lower today so far on Friday.
So again, just just a very defined narrow channel that continues and this is that this
channel is very long in the tooth, we've gone this is longer than the one we had back in
June and July of last year, that eventually resolved into a 10% correction.
But no, the the the the the kind of 45 degree angle of the market continues to exist here.
It's very, it's very bullish, there's nothing, you know, nothing not bullish about that complacency
is extremely low volatility, as represented by the VIX index remains, you know, extremely
muted.
Okay, sorry, complacency is extremely high, but yes, I'm sorry, volatility is low complacency
is very high.
And you take a look at, you know, professional investors allocations, retail investors allocations,
they're all creeping up, household equity allocations are near all time highs.
So again, you just could not ask for a more bullish market right now.
And again, you know, yes, we still expect a correction to come.
And yes, we will have a correction.
But the problem with that in saying that is that it can take a lot longer than you think.
And so, you know, as is always the risk to investing, what we do as investors is if I
come out and say, okay, we're gonna have a correction, then people go out and they sell
everything because I said there's gonna be a correction.
Well, then Lance is wrong, because he said there was gonna be a correction.
The timing is always the hard part.
And these markets, particularly very complacent, low, very complacent, low volatility markets
can remain this way for a lot longer than you think in this and this condition has lasted
much longer than we've seen in previous periods.
So again, it will resolve itself eventually.
But that's why we just now have to wait is we've kind of talked about over the last couple
of weeks, your warning sign is going to be that break of that 20 day moving average once
those computer algorithms once we break that 20 day moving average, very likely the algos
have been buying that moving average will start selling it, because that will now be
the break that they're programmed to.
So a break of that 20 day, you'll see a big pickup in selling a sharper decline.
And then you'll probably start a correction process at that point.
Okay, so a couple of things.
First off in your chart here, the 20 day moving average is the red line there in the middle,
correct?
Yeah, it is.
Okay.
So just because you're proud of the algos, you know, a ton of market activity now happens
from these algorithms, right, which are basically software programs that people write.
You know, there's sort of an arms race in the big money, right of who's got the best
algos that are the smartest and can trade the market the most, right?
If you read the book Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, you know, you've got a good sense of
kind of the craziness that goes on in that world in terms of who can get the higher the
best quants and who can write the best models and who can get the fastest direct connection
to the exchanges.
I mean, there's a massive universe there that we as regular investors just don't see, right?
And so anyways, I can't remember what the percentage of trades that are made by the
algos is these days, versus the live human, but it's the vast majority.
And I know that it's almost all quotes, like 99.99999% of quotes are generated by algos.
So there's a saying, I just want to get your reaction to it, which is like, you know, a
neutron bomb could take out all life on the planet, and like, trading would continue.
Yeah.
Now, unfortunately, in that case, you know, and again, we've seen this as, you know, just
a good example of this, you know, Bitcoin's had a huge run here, right?
It's been correcting, you know, recently, since I wrote that article about, you know,
about Bitcoin topping, but you know, it's been correcting, but that whole advance in
Bitcoin happened after market hours.
So you know, that's the other problem is that there's a lot of trading that goes on after
market hours that retail investors don't get to play in, but institutions do.
So there's not, it's not a fair and equal playing field for the average investor.
Yeah, and I don't have the chart handy, but you were reminding me of charts that we saw
often kind of in that stretch between 2010 and 2021, which would show that, I want to
say not the majority, but maybe almost all the increase in the S&P was happening after
hours.
So it's sort of like you traded US daily hours, which is whatever retail investor does.
I think he actually lost money over like one of the best bull runs of all time, right?
But if you had the ability to trade in the overnight markets, you made a killing over
that same time.
Yeah, that's right.
No, then that still goes on today.
A lot of the gains that are made are made overnight when the futures trade.
It's a much thinner market, but it's also a market that, you know, institutions can
play in fairly easy so that they can move that price around a bit more than they can
during the day.
But again, yeah, you go back and look at how much money was made after hours versus what
was made during market hours and again, to your point, there's lots of charts out there
that show that the vast majority of gains, if not all of them were actually accrued after
market hours.
Oh, and of course we're talking about trading.
So if you were a retail investor and just bought and then held during that period, you
did okay.
But to Lance's point, there's just, there's many, many advantages that tilt the playing
field vastly towards, you know, the institutional, you know, buyers and whatnot and us little
guys generally always get the short end of the stick which is one of the reasons why
I always refer people to good financial advisors because you're at least trying to recruit
a professional to get on your side there.
All right, so no big surprise.
We're at another all time high in the markets this week.
You know, there have been some folks out there that have called for S and P 6,000 right over
the past couple of years.
And now all of a sudden, you know, I'm hearing from a lot of their people saying, Hey, you
know, these guys are right.
And who knows them, they might be.
We always talk about the gravitational pull of the big round number.
We were talking about this as we were getting close to 5,000 on the S and P. Well, we blew
through that.
What do you think?
Is there enough in this market to get us to 6000 S and P this year?
Yeah, well, I don't know about this year, but certainly by eventually, but I'm just
curious.
Yeah, I don't know if we go straight there from here.
I mean, it's certainly pot and look, anything is possible, right?
I mean, you're talking, you're talking roughly about 800 points on the S and P. So, you know,
it's not a tremendous stretch to get there.
And you know, if there's some type of, you know, the Fed, you know, stops QT entirely
starts going back to QE, and they're already talking about that.
If we get some time, I was beginning to show a little leg on that.
Yeah.
So, you know, and so again, you know, there's some certainly some things that could get
this market there.
I'll tell you the one thing that's let me I'm gonna share a screen with you.
This is one thing that kind of jumped out to me this morning.
I was doing kind of my morning run on Twitter.
And I was posting some charts.
And this one really kind of jumped out to me a bit.
I actually got a couple, but this one really kind of so this is the rolling 20 week, 21
week US equity fund flows and funds and ETFs.
And what's interesting is, is that you have this massive increase in the amount of funds
flowing into equity funds.
Now 2020, 2021 made complete sense, right?
Because we were sending checks to households.
And even though we hear all these stories about how tapped the consumer is and how the
balance sheets are weak and blah, blah, blah, they're coming up with a lot of cash to invest
in equities and chase this market.
So, you know, the whole equity chase is certainly back in terms of the markets.
And again, you know, when markets are going up, investors are really able to find, you
know, excess cash to invest either through leverage or however they're doing it.
We are seeing free credit balances on margins go back up.
So, you know, people are leveraging into the market.
But again, it's just quite fascinating that even, you know, higher interest rates, you
know, five and a quarter, five and a half percent by the Fed and higher interest rates
and long bonds and higher borrowing costs.
And of course, you know, all we talk about all these other impacts on the consumer, they
are certainly piling into equities, you know, kind of hand over fist right now in terms
of the retail side.
Now, again, you have to understand, retails are very, very small buyers of the markets,
right?
Corporations are your big buyers.
We wrote an article talking about corporate share buybacks earlier this week and went
through all the math.
But here's a kind of a quick, you know, download on that.
If you take out pension funds and mutual funds, so this is equity flow since the beginning
of the turn of the century, since 2000.
So pensions have sold $2.2 trillion in equities, makes sense.
They've got to fund retirees, right?
So they have a retiree, you know, surge that's going on right now.
We wrote an article on social security and pension plans on actually today, on Friday.
We're going to talk about that in a bit.
Yeah.
So, you know, that's a big problem.
But again, pensions have to sell equities in order to fund the retirement benefits.
Mutual funds have lost about half a trillion dollars worth of flows because that's moved
over to ETFs.
So households are up about 6.6 trillion, foreign investors have bought about 1.8 trillion,
corporations 5.5.
If you do math on this, take out the negatives from the positives, corporations have bought
a hundred percent of the equity market since 2000.
So again, that's all of your, yeah, sorry.
Is that buybacks?
Yeah, that's corporate buybacks.
Okay.
So in other words, the only net buyer, once you subtract out the gainers and the losers,
the only net buyer of equities has been corporations since the turn of the century.
Most of that, and again, like I said, we wrote about buybacks on Tuesday.
That's all been a massive surge really since 2016, 2017, which is why small caps and mid
caps have really underperformed large caps during that same timeframe.
Because they're gorgeous.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Super interesting.
So you talk about how you have markets like Japan, right, where the government basically
is the bond market now.
Right.
What was?
Pardon me?
So Japan just announced that they're going to stop buying equity and bonds, so we'll
see what happens.
Okay.
Actually, we should talk about that in the future show to see what the impact of that's
going to be.
But for years now, basically nobody in Japan was buying bonds and so the government stepped
in and bought them all, right?
It sounds like we sort of have the corporate version of that going on in the equity markets.
Not that nobody is buying equities right now.
But on a net basis, you're saying basically what's driving this market is the companies
themselves that are listed on these exchanges and this is almost, I mean, it kind of has
a little bit of a feel of the promoter who's buying his own shares just to keep driving
the price.
And hey, if you can get away with it, why not just keep buying to infinity, right?
And of course, one of the things you and I have read in the past about this is that buybacks,
there's a lot of accounting gimmickry that goes on there and hey, look, it's real money
that's being used to buy the shares in most cases.
But it's an extraction vehicle for the top executives and the biggest investors in these
companies.
No, that's true, it's one of the big myths that is portrayed by Wall Street on investors,
which says it's a return of cash to shareholders.
In fact, there was a survey out this morning from Bank of America that said that there's
a rising number of investors that are wanting more share capital, return of capital functions
by corporations, right?
Which is basically code for buyback.
When somebody buys back shares of a company, Apple doesn't send you a check, right?
There is no return of cash to you when they buy back their own shares.
Now, if they issue a dividend, right, you get a dividend.
So that's actually a return of cash.
The SEC has done numerous studies on this, and of course, this has been one of the big
conundrums since the turn of the century, which has been this massive surge in bonds.
The only ones that fit from that are, to your point, insiders, which are selling their shares
back to the company to fund stock option compensation programs, their compensation, et cetera.
So-
They get a check.
They get a check.
You don't.
And again, it's kind of a ridiculous statement when the company buys back shares, it's a
return of capital to shareholders.
Well, it is only from the function that supposedly the price goes up.
Well, the price-
The shares go up, yeah.
Right.
So my share prices went up because the company bought back their own shares.
So they must think the company's cheap.
And look, I just wrote about this this past week.
Let me find, I'm going to show you something real fast.
I was going to ask about this exact thing you're pulling up here.
Because I also have a different quote from Warren Buffett as well, which is kind of important
to this whole thing.
So first of all, if you go back and look at share buybacks, share buybacks really became
of age post the financial crisis.
And since 2011, the increase in the S&P, 27% of that increase has come solely from buybacks.
Then of course, there's earnings that provided some of the growth, dividends and et cetera.
Now before the correction, so going into 2020, 44% of the return of the index had come from
buybacks.
So again, that correction during 2022, we had that kind of sell off in the markets has
reduced that gain a little bit.
But now it's starting to catch back up again.
Sorry to interrupt, but just for the viewers here, the buybacks are the green in this chart,
right?
So in other words, the S&P would be 27% lower than where it is now if it wasn't for buybacks.
So again, this is the big problem.
And so what this chart shows is, is this is the cumulative change in share buybacks versus
the cumulative change in the S&P since 1994.
And so you can see that between 1994 and 2000, basically there was no buybacks going on.
Now why is that?
So buybacks were illegal prior to 1990.
They were considered to be a form of stock market manipulation prior to 1990.
But why all of a sudden did buybacks become in vogue after 1999 really starting in 2000?
Well, remember in 1999, Bill Clinton, who was president at the time, he was going after
this wealth gap between corporate executives and the population.
So he passed this law that said, well, corporate executives can only get paid a total of a
million dollars.
And so wall street said, okay, that's fine.
We'll do the rest of his comp and stock options.
And so that's when stock options really took off and buybacks became a function of funding
that compensation structure for corporate executives.
And then post 2008, you can just see that all of a sudden the cumulative change in those
buybacks has just been larger and larger and larger.
And the reason is, is this is how companies are beating earnings estimates.
Because if I buy back shares, it lowers the number of shares outstanding.
So when I'm looking at a dollar's worth of earnings versus the number of shares outstanding,
my EPS goes up as I reduce that number of shares.
So in order to make earnings and of course continue to meet compensation structures,
et cetera, I'm having to issue more and more of these stock buybacks.
And now you'll notice like FedEx just reported earnings today, revenues were down, shipments
were down, stocks up like 11 or 12% today, because they announced a 5 billion share buyback.
This has become commonplace for companies, even though they have Apple's great example
of this.
Michael Leibowitz just wrote an article about Apple and buybacks recently, is that companies
that have slower rates of revenue and earnings growth are now focusing more and more on buybacks
to help supplant the difference.
And this has become a normality for the markets over time.
And again, if we just take a look at earnings growth, so this is S&P 500 trailing earnings,
and that's what's in red.
So that's trailing EPS.
Now you'll notice that peak in the S&P in 2022, we had the bear market supposedly correction,
and then the market's taken off.
Well you'll notice that earnings were kind of just flat during that period, but in reality
earnings declined and then they've come back up a bit.
But the reason that earnings are flat is because buybacks have been going up, and that's been
supporting that earnings decline.
In other words, we didn't get the big decline in earnings that we should have gotten during
that correction and during that slowdown in the economy.
Remember we had two negative quarters of GDP growth in 2020, right?
And we never showed that really reflected in earnings.
And that was because the increase in buybacks have been supporting that weaker earnings
growth.
We never had that decline in earnings, and now-
And sorry, when you say decline in earnings, you mean decline in earnings per share, right?
Earnings per share.
Right.
Because that's the way we look at EPS, right?
So this is earnings per share for the S&P 500.
The earnings were going down, but they were removing shares with the buybacks and therefore
the earnings per share didn't adjust the way that-
Exactly.
They were flattish, right?
And so all of a sudden things look a whole lot better than they did in reality.
But you can also see this just if you take a look at this chart.
So this is the four-week change in share buybacks versus the S&P.
And it's kind of like a volatility graph, but you can see that it's really starting
at about 2015, 2016.
There's just a big expansion of these buybacks.
And of course, when you have periods of declining buybacks, the markets decline.
And when you have periods of expanding buybacks, markets go up.
And that's why there's an 85% correlation between the four-week cumulative change in
buybacks versus the S&P change.
So in other words, without buybacks, the market would not be doing what it's doing because
a big function, again, this goes back to that chart I started with, was showing that corporate
buybacks are making up about 100% of the net equity purchases of the market.
That's why there's such a huge correlation between buybacks and the market.
Hey, can I ask a leading question, which is, so buybacks were illegal in the past because
they were considered a form of stock manipulation, right?
You pull up a chart like that, that says, yeah, basically there's an incredible correlation
between these buybacks and the increase in the S&P.
How does that just not remake the case, which is that, hey, this drives the price of the
indices.
This is manipulation.
Is anyone asking why is this still legal?
Well, actually it's fine because Mike and I just had this conversation this morning
in that if we go back in history, we've had problems in the markets before, and again,
a lot of people watching your video right now or watching this video are a lot younger.
They weren't around at the turn of the century when Enron blew up.
And of course, when Enron blew up, we had to change things.
So we came out with Sarbanes-Oxley, right?
And so we had to fix the accounting system because of the things that were created.
Now, while Enron was running their scam, nobody cared because they were just printing money
hand over fist.
And so as long as everybody's making money, nobody really looks at this stuff and nobody
really cares.
They say, "Oh, I'll stop buybacks.
Hey, it's a return to capital shareholders.
What can be wrong with that?"
It's all good.
The reason that they're not good is because it's a misuse of capital by companies.
And there is a consequence for that.
And we were talking about this earlier today, which is eventually buybacks will be shut
down at some point.
And the reason will be, is that something will happen where buybacks are found to be
the culprit.
And let me give you a good example of, we actually almost got there.
In 2020, when we shut down the economy, we had to bail out Boeing, a massive corporation.
They make billions of dollars a year in their profits, but they'd spent five years using
all of their cash to buy back shares to support their stock.
And so when we shut down the economy, all of a sudden they didn't have any capital on
hand.
And so we had to go bail them out.
We had to bail out Royal Thripping, who was also a massive or share repurchaser as well.
So again, the problem is that, see, this is all fine and dandy until there's some problem
that comes along.
And these companies have used all their capital to buy back shares to support their share
price and bail out their executives.
And then all of a sudden they can't support the company during an economic downturn.
And that's why they should be made illegal, right?
Because that capital should be used for purposes of shoring up the balance sheet, creating
better opportunities for their workers, expanding their business, doing capital expenditures
or research and development, all of which employs more people.
And that's what creates a better economic environment, not buying back shares.
And the reason I bring all this up is, is that I quoted Warren Buffett in his latest
shareholder report.
He says, "The math isn't complicated.
When the share count goes down, your interest in our many businesses increases."
He's right.
Right?
That's an absolutely true statement.
So if you own Berkshire Hathaway and he buys back shares, then your interest is greater
in all the businesses you own because there's fewer shares outstanding.
So your shares are worth more.
So absolutely true statement.
Every small bit helps, even if repurchasers are made at value, if repurchasers are made
at value or creative prices.
There's the key sentence.
He goes on to explain, "Just as surely when a company overpays for repurchases, the continuing
shareholders lose.
At such times, gains flow only to the selling shareholders."
See, this is the point I'm trying to make about this is not a return of capital to investors.
The gains flow only to selling shareholders.
Well, who's selling?
It's the insiders.
It's not you.
Right?
You're not selling your Berkshire Hathaway stock.
The insiders are.
And actually not in that case, but if it's Apple or these other big share buyback companies.
The gains only flow to the selling shareholders and to the friendly but expensive investment
banker who recommended the fullest purchases in the first place.
And so this is the point that eludes most investors.
They love buybacks because it's driving up the price.
There's an end game to this.
I don't know where it is, but there's an end game to where the dark side of all this will
come out.
So again, this could be decades from now, but in theory, right, if companies keep purchasing
back all their shares at the current pace that they're doing, they'll eventually all
be private.
Right?
I mean, you've got to either issue more shares at some point to keep buying them back or
you're going to buy back all of your shares.
Now for a company like Apple, there's billions of shares that'll take a long time, but you
get the point.
There is a point to where there is a return on that investment that is not lucrative to
companies.
Yeah, and to me, this has a similar feel to we do a bunch of stimulus that creates inflation.
And so to deal with the inflation pain that the average person is feeling, we send them
checks in the mail, which makes them feel better in the moment, but it makes the inflation
problem even worse.
So here we are giving gargantuan returns to the insiders and the friendly, which by the
way, the friendly also includes our Congress people who have ridiculously successful trading
records, many of them trading these companies because they're sitting there at the front
row of writing legislation and knowing who's going to benefit from this stuff.
And to your point, we as little investors, well, if we look at it with just our own selfish
point of view, oh, if I own Apple and Apple goes up, well, then I'm doing well.
So yeah, buybacks are great, right?
But to your point, you eventually carry this out where whatever value these companies have,
eventually they go private, right?
If you keep doing this and then you don't get to own any of it and everybody, the insiders
who do, they own all the equity of this thing.
And to your point as well, it's just like it's all continuing this whole sort of too
big to fail game.
Like the Boeing example is a great example of this, but we all remember this during the
banking crisis as well, right?
These guys are basically just siphoning value out of these companies.
And if they get in trouble, they know the government's going to step in.
And that was, I remember reading those headlines and being really angry about what was going
on with Boeing, which is, wait a minute, these guys have just been lining their pockets,
right?
And now because the company's drained of cash, we have to pony up to bail them out, right?
And it's not like they stopped paying management bonuses or stuff like that, right?
So why would they change?
It's the best deal in the world for these guys.
Right.
And that's my whole point is that something will eventually happen, right?
I don't know what it is.
I'm not making any predictions, so don't make any claims that I am.
But at some point something will happen and there is a consequence to every action, right?
For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
So eventually at some point something will happen and the culprit will be the stock share
buybacks and the share repurchases because they've become too aggressive or whatever
the reason is.
And then we'll pass a law that bans share repurchases again, right?
And then we'll go back to the way it was.
But this is what we always do is that we pass laws.
Let me give you a good example of this.
So in 1929, when the market peaked and that was the beginning of the end heading into
the depression, Charles Ponzi was at the very top of that peak, right?
And that was the whole origination of the Ponzi scheme at that point.
And so after the crash in '29, in 1932, I'm sorry, 1933, 1934, we established the SEC
and we passed the Investment Advisors Act and we did all this other stuff in the '40s.
And one of the things that occurred during that process was that we separated out banks
and brokerage firms and said, "You two cannot play together anymore because going up into
1929, the banks were loaning money to their customers to buy the shares of the IPOs that
the banks were issuing."
And so it was a closed loop and so the banks just kept loaning out money and then issuing
shares that the clients were investing in and it ran the market up to the moon until
it blew up.
And it was fine on the way up.
Nobody cared because everybody's making money hand over fist, right?
But after the fact, we said, "Hey, that's probably not a good idea.
There should be a Chinese wall between these two."
And so for the next really 70 years, the world works fantastic.
Everything's fine with banking crises.
We don't have any major deficits back in the '50s, '50s, back in 1973, '74, you had that
big bear market, but there was no big financial credit event, et cetera, of any magnitude.
And then in the 1990s, the banks go, "Man, this is not fair."
Of course, at that time, the market's just screaming off to the moon during the 1990s,
heading into the dot-com bubble and Wall Street is raking in money hand over fist.
They're issuing out IPOs as fast as they can get them to the Wall Street and retail investors
are lapping them up and it's all about day trading now and we have the online trading
firms, et cetera, through AOL, you can buy stocks, this whole thing.
And so yeah, we've got the E-Trade baby, the whole nine yards.
And so the banks got upset because their whole fee structure was checking account fees and
they weren't making any money so they lobbied Congress heavily to get rid of that Chinese
wall until Congress says, "Sure, you give me enough money, I'll get rid of that wall
for you."
And we did.
And then seven years later, the market crashes, it's a financial crisis and who's at the top
of that ladder?
Bernie Madoff with the Ponzi scheme.
So again, we don't ever learn our lesson because we always forget our history and then we repeat
things over again.
And so this is the problem with never teaching history of people and us forgetting our history
is that we're going to wind up repeating the same thing.
So we're doing the same thing.
There was a reason we outlawed corporate share buybacks originally.
We forgotten why we did it, but eventually we'll figure that out again and have to pass
the law again.
We relearn.
Yeah.
And then we'll probably do something like you were saying with Clinton where we'll make
these illegal, but some little doorway will open somewhere where the insiders will still
get rich but it's another way that takes us 30 or 50 years to figure out how to close
that window.
Well, and look, that's the thing is that Wall Street is very creative.
So when you shut off one door, they're going to open another door.
They'll figure it out.
But I mean, look, you could stop this problem very easily.
And the big issue about share buybacks is really the benefit to corporate insiders.
And so the one thing that everybody rails against is how rich these executives are.
And it's so unfair.
The executives make 50 times what the worker makes.
Okay.
It's easy fix.
You tax buybacks at 35% and it solves your problem because at 30 or 35% tax on buybacks,
companies will quit doing buybacks because it's not financially feasible for them to
do that.
If you tax those, we're always talking about trying to tax the rich, the ultra rich Elizabeth
worn out over the weekend or this week, rather talking about an ultra rich tax tax buybacks.
It's a massive amount of money.
It's $5.5 trillion through a 30% tax on that.
You can pay off a big chunk of the deficit.
That's really interesting.
Yeah.
Maybe we don't make it illegal.
Maybe we just make it prohibitively costly.
Or let's help the taxpayers at least tax the damn thing so that at least we can pay off
some of the debt.
Yeah.
I mean, technically that's sort of a tax on the rich, which is if you own the financial
assets that are doing buybacks, but it's a way to do it that maybe feels a little bit
more fair or at least it's reducing in unfairness in the market right now.
Right.
So anyways.
All right.
Well, look on the topic of buybacks, what we're talking about here probably will take
decades to play out of when the next.
Oh, I'll be dead before it happens probably, but yeah.
But you actually wrote this piece that you showed us a few charts from because we're
now going into a blackout period for buybacks.
Right as we enter, Q2 is looking to be interesting, right?
There's a lot of things that are happening in Q2 that may affect this rising tide of
net liquidity that we've been talking about a lot.
You throw the buyback blackout window kind of into the mix.
So was the point of this article to kind of wave a little flag to folks just to say, "Hey,
be careful here, some of the rocket fuel that's been driving this rally is getting removed
for a period of time."
Well, yeah.
I mean, look, what my job is, is to look for risk.
I mean, that's my job, right?
I mean, if you don't care about risk, just go buy an S&P index fund and go home, right?
And again, you'll probably be fine over a long enough period of time, right?
But what I'm paid for is to watch out for the risk.
So I'm always looking for, okay, what is it that could kind of undermine this rally in
the market?
And given that buybacks have such a strong correlation to rising markets, that window
closed last Friday and that net liquidity flow is going to be shut off for about a month.
So again, it's just one of the buyers of equities has been removed from the market temporarily.
The biggest buyer from your charts.
Yeah, a very big buyer has been removed from the markets for about a month until we get
into earnings season.
But again, right now, there's so much money floating around, it may make no difference
whatsoever.
And there's so much optimism and positivity about the markets.
I mean, if you take a look at a lot of the meme stocks, the speculative trades, those
types of things, people are just piling into those again.
And again, what's so fascinating to me is that this is very reminiscent, the way the
market's behaving, this very low volatility advance is very similar to what we saw in
2020 and 2021, where you have this very low volatility, steady advance because of all
of those checks going to households that people were hopping on the Robinhood app and opening
up their account for the first time, throwing $1,400 into the market.
But yet we don't have that going on, right?
We don't have those checks flowing to households, but it's that very same type of feel that
everybody just can't wait to go invest something.
My feeds on TikTok and Twitter and everything else are filled up with how to trade your
rate of wealth and buy these five Bitcoins because they're going to go to the moon next.
And it was exactly the same thing that we saw in 2021 before it all blew up in 2022.
The same thing will happen here, it's just a function of time.
And I just don't know what causes it.
And so that's where I was going with this, which is I'm sure no surprise to you.
But the people that I interview on this channel, they tend to be fundamentalists, they're macro
analysts for the most part, although there are people that are TA and momentum based
as well.
But they're waving at risks all over the place.
But with the markets now again, and yet another all time high this week, there are folks in
the comments and I get it that are just saying like, "Hey, you bears just don't get it."
And my question to you is, I'm seeing more and more people just embrace the like, "Hey,
I learned to stop worrying and just learn to love the bubble."
But that's so fascinating because that was the same conversation we had in 2020 and 2021.
And it was exactly the same thing, the market's just going up and the bears are dead wrong.
And then you had 2022, the market declines by 20%, but most of the stocks that people
were chasing were down 80 and 90%.
If you don't realize this, the average retail investor is still negative.
They haven't even got back to even yet from 2022.
So they're still down about 3-4% from 2022.
And that's because they were invested in a lot of these meme stocks and things that went
down 70, 80, 90% in value.
And again, there was this very brief period where we were reading articles in the Wall
Street Journal where people had invested all their money into meme coins or meme stocks
and lost it all and now they were millionaires and now they're dead broke and working part-time
at a gas station type thing.
And there was a bunch of Wall Street articles about these types of things that happened
and now we're all back.
And we all assume that this is just going to continue forever, but when you start hearing
those comments, that's your contrarian indicator because when everybody is exuberant, everybody
is bought, everybody's in the markets, that's what sets the correction eventually to come
and whatever causes it, who knows.
But remember, we had the same sentiment back in June and July of last year.
It was the AI bubble.
So remember in March of last year, we had Silicon Valley bank went belly up, right?
And the Fed steps in by the bank term funding program.
So they come out with a BTFB program and bail out the regional banks and the market takes
off after that point, rallies, the market's up 17, 18% by July.
Everybody's assuming that this bull market is going to continue and whenever the market's
up this much in the beginning of the year, it's always up this much more by the end of
the year.
And it had all this bullish narrative going on.
And then the market corrects by 10% going into October.
By October, investor sentiment was extremely negative.
My comments were all filled up about, man, is this sell-off ever going to stop?
I mean, this market is just going to go down forever.
And this is how that emotional content swings back and forth.
So when you see that type of bullish sentiment, it's normally a great contrarian indicator
that something is going to occur.
And again, it doesn't have to be a market crash.
We don't have to have a 30% decline, but even a five or a 10% correction after this rally
is going to feel terrible.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're going to have headlines that the world's ending if we're down 6%.
Yeah, exactly.
And so that's what's going to happen, and it's just a function of time until we get
there.
And it'll happen before the end of this year.
We'll have a correction before the election.
It's just a function of time until we get, again, 5%, 10%, 7%, somewhere in that range.
But you'll have some type of correction before we get to the election, and people will be
convinced that this is the beginning of the next bear market.
And it's not.
It's just a good, healthy correction that'll reset the table so you can put some capital
to work.
OK.
Let's talk about this.
So there's animal spirits running, speculative fervor, whatever term you want to use to describe
what's powering all this higher right now.
And we haven't even talked yet about Powell and the Fed released this week and how that
gave a lot of juice to those animal spirits.
But I want to talk about a couple of things that are indicators of the current level of
speculation, but also some things that are showing that speculation might be getting
played out here.
So first, on the pro-speculation side, you were talking that we're seeing things that
we've seen in different past cycles.
So we've got our first social media IPO in a couple of years, right?
With Reddit?
Yep.
Look, I'm not super-duper into the Reddit books.
So this is a guy watching from the cheap seats.
But I know Reddit is a company, right?
I've worked at Yahoo.
I know this space fairly well.
And Reddit's kind of been a chronic case of like, "Oh my God, this company's got a ton
of users, but they don't really have the world's best business model."
And it's been a laggard from sort of like a revenue generation perspective.
But all of a sudden in the AI world, they're like, "Wow, we got a couple of decades of
user conversations here that companies can use to train their AI on."
And so all of a sudden there's all this interest in Reddit.
And I'm like, "All right, well, look, if that really works, that's kind of like a one-time
value creation event.
We crawl your archives and then, okay, we've learned what we're going to learn from that."
And again, this is all happening in an era where anything with AI on it's going bananas.
To me, just like I feel like the buy now, pay later, those are the most predictable
headlines in the world.
I know what the headlines are going to be in a year about that, which is why did anybody
think this was a good idea and who could have seen this coming, right?
This one, it seems so easy to predict that in a year's time or something like that, people
are going to be like, "Whoa, we really got ahead of ourselves on that Reddit valuation."
But right now, people are snapping up the IPO.
Well, and you probably know more because of your background, you probably understand more
about Reddit than I do.
So, my take on it is that you've got a bunch of unpaid moderators, right?
So basically, I can be a moderator for Reddit and I can start a channel and we can talk
about whatever, pink monkeys, and we can get a whole Reddit thread running around these
pink monkeys.
Well, at some point, the problem I see for Reddit is that particularly in today's society
where there's so much concern about who says what and is it, got an ism attached to it
of one form or another, it's kind of the Wild West of the internet of stuff that gets posted
there.
And I've seen some of the Reddit posts that are out there and some of the Reddit channels
particularly when, if you remember back during the meme rush, we were talking a lot about
the Reddit channel, wrote some articles.
There was the Wall Street Bets Reddit channel.
And some of the posts that were on that channel were not for prime time use, right?
And so, you almost have to wonder at some point, do the moderators start demanding to
be paid?
Hey, you know what?
You're public making money hand over fist, how about sharing the wealth, right?
Well, once you start sharing the wealth, that's going to impact your revenue flow because
right now you've got to pay moderators, pay them benefits, all these types of things.
So, it seems to me that the model that they had at work great on the private side, I'm
not so sure as a public company that they're going to be able to maintain that structure.
To me, it seems like there's going to be some hurdles to get across that are probably going
to greatly reduce that profitability look.
And to your point, it's from the AI training platform, I don't know if the value or the
information creation there is really that beneficial because from some of the stuff
that you see out there, in terms of misinformation, there's a whole lot of it.
So, I completely agree, yeah.
You get, I mean, any system, right?
Garbage in, garbage out, a lot of garbage on there, right?
Not saying that there's not stuff, but still, yeah, I think there's some pretty wild assumptions
being made at how valuable that is, right?
But to your point though, but here's the point of this though to this is, look, why do we
have IPOs, right?
The reason we have IPOs is that Wall Street has people that invested in this and they
want out.
And when there's a lot of speculative fervor in the market, the market's demanding product.
And this is a great example, we saw it during 2020 with SPACs, right?
We couldn't get IPOs out fast enough so we created these special purpose acquisition
companies that we could get to market, which was basically give me money now and I'll find
something to invest in later, but we do this.
But Wall Street's job is to provide product when there's demand and there's a lot of demand
for products.
So, you take, this is why we get really crappy companies that go public.
In 1999, 2000, you'll remember this, Adam, because you were around back then, pets.com,
bluemonkey.com.
There was a whole bunch of these companies that had no revenue model.
They had no real structure.
They had no business plan and they went public because they had a website.
And by 2002, most of those were out of business.
But again, this is where we are in the cycle.
There's a lot of demand because of speculative fervor and Wall Street's going, I'm out, sell
it.
Give me my money.
I'm out of this.
Wall Street will make a bunch of money.
Most likely most investors won't.
Yeah.
And like, I think Reddit is a great example where I think a lot of institutional investors
have felt trapped in it or have kind of felt trapped in it.
Because it was like this thing we just can't really figure out how to monetize.
And now they've got a window where they're like, great, there's a patsy at the table.
Who wants to play this game?
Great.
Let's let them buy in.
Let's give them as much of this thing as they want to.
Finally we're out.
Yeah, I mean, again, this happens all throughout market history, but this just really seems
to be one of those times, again, sign of excessive speculation, where you can just sell complete
trash.
And I'm not trying to say Reddit's complete trash, but it certainly happens during times
like this where, as you said, the excited late stage investor shows up at the table
and wants in, and they'll just sell him whatever garbage they can unload on.
Yeah, you know, BuzzFeed and Vice could have hung on long enough, they might have had an
exit.
You know what?
I think you're right.
Right.
Okay, so that's a sign of really excessive speculation.
Now kind of on the other end, who knows, price changes every week, but Bitcoin has actually
cooled off here a fair amount, right?
Down from like $75,000 or so to now I think around $62,000, the way that we're talking.
But Bitcoin, and I know probably get some hate from some of the folks in the comments
here, but its correlation with the S&P is quite high.
And so when the hot money starts flowing, Bitcoin does well.
So could Bitcoin be giving us a little canary in the coal mine, it kind of took off a little
bit before the markets really started raging?
Is it now showing us where the markets might be going?
Oh, that if Bitcoin's cooled off by 15% market might do so too?
Yeah, well, you know, I wrote that article just recently about Bitcoin and gold as speculative
warning signs.
And there to your point, there's a there's a high correlation between gold prices and
Bitcoin in the markets, particularly as of late over the last several years.
So people really taking the other side of that story, but keep going.
Sure, I'm sure I like I said, I got no I got no hunt in that game.
So just basically the analysis, right?
So take it or leave it, whatever.
But you know, the point is, is that, you know, you had this big rush into Bitcoin with the
issuance of ETFs, which was not surprising.
And you know, now that that kind of initial kind of fervors over, it's not surprising
that you're seeing it cool off here a bit.
Now look, I don't think that Bitcoin is going to crash back to, you know, 20,000 again,
it certainly could, but not without some type of market related event, if the market starts
to sell off pretty aggressively, then I think you'll see Bitcoin and gold prices down quite
a bit more before before we get to the bottom of that correction, though.
Okay.
All right.
So, so there's that, right, we're seeing Bitcoin cool off.
There also is a surprising drumbeat that I gotta say, I've kind of been waiting to see
we've kind of been cheering on.
And we've railed about this a little bit in the past, Lance, but we're seeing increasing
government targeting of the Magnificent Seven, or a lot of the players of the Magnificent
Seven for antitrust issues, right?
So we've seen it in Google, we've seen it with Amazon, we've seen it with meta.
And now we're seeing it with Apple.
And I mean, it's kind of crazy when how late to the game they can be on some of this stuff.
Right.
And they're basically saying, wow, Apple, you've built this really, you know, dominant
share of the smartphone market, and boy, you're not letting other people play in your ecosystem.
You're trying to create this closed garden, which, of course, anybody that's been following
Apple for the past 20 years is like, duh, I mean, exactly.
Right.
Oh, my gosh, Google, you've got a really dominant share of, you know, the online advertising
market.
Duh, right.
I mean, how do you have you not seen that?
You're showing the party pretty late.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, it's like the fireman showing up at your house when you're standing over its ashes
saying, hey, your house is getting pretty warm.
Right.
So anyways, I just, you know, I don't think it's going to change anything in the markets,
you know, like tomorrow, although Apple obviously sold off a bit at this latest announcement.
But at the end of the day, it's all about sentiment, market cycles, right?
And we've had this just completely bulletproof, fang complex, now magnificent seven complex.
I don't know.
Like this to me feels like something that if it were to continue to build steam could
really maybe start pulling down, you know, acting like gravity on these mag seven prices.
No, it certainly could.
But again, don't forget, this is an election year also.
So this is the, you know, I'm going to if you elect me, the senator, congressman, president,
whatever, I'm going to go after these, you know, these companies that are taking all
your money, blah, blah, blah.
You know what?
You know, there are like some of my biggest donors.
Yeah.
You know what?
You exactly.
This is why nothing's actually ever going to happen.
Because, you know, once they're once they're back in office, the law go away.
But I mean, look, you know, the the American consumer has all the power in the world.
If you want to if you want to, you know, take care of Apple, stop buying their products.
Apple owns roughly about twenty five, twenty six, twenty seven percent of the smartphone
market.
Google owns the rest through Android.
So you know, Samsung, etc.
So you know, they don't own a massive share of the smartphone market, but they have a
very dominant product.
But so you've got other choices, right?
Go buy a different phone, stop supporting Apple products.
Once they lose all the revenue, then they'll change their behavior, right?
You've got the ability to fix these things, but we just don't want to always go back to,
you know, in 2008.
Adam, you remember this?
You know, we had the Occupy Wall Street movement.
You remember that?
And and we had it was the ninety nine percent.
Right.
And they're all going to occupy Wall Street against the evil one percent.
They're all standing out there complaining about Steve Jobs and and these massive corporations
that are all tweeting and working on their Apple computers and tweeting on their Apple
iPhones and complaining about the one percent while they're supporting all their product
at the same time.
So, you know, we have the ability to change these monopolies.
We just don't want to because it's not convenient.
So we want our congressmen to do it and break them up and do these things.
But really, we don't want them to.
Because if you start going really after Apple, Apple is going to lose a big chunk of its
market share.
And that's going to upset a lot of people in Wall Street and institutions, a lot of
people that own Apple shares and their 401k plans and then their personal accounts and
their IRAs.
You know, so it all sounds good on the surface.
We're going to go after these companies until it starts affecting people in the share prices
of these companies, because this is this is an action that's going to make these companies
bigger, broader, better and go take a look at what happened at AT&T following the breakup
there.
So, no, I just want to underscore what you're saying, which is, you know, a lot of people
feel like, what can I do?
I don't really have any agency.
If I switch from an Apple phone to an Android phone, is that going to change the world?
Right.
But then you look at some of these recent consumer boycotts.
And to make it clear, folks, I'm not I'm not I'm not saying I was in favor or against any
of these.
I'm just noting that they happened.
But but there were there were some pretty big consumer boycott to recently, largely
on the conservative side.
Right.
So this was sort of a reaction to the the woke ism of or perceived woke ism of some
of corporate America.
So I'm thinking of the Bud Light.
Right.
Bud Light.
There was pushback against led pushback against Disney for some of its movie content.
There was a big thing against Target, right.
For some some of their products, we'll say.
And it really affected their bottom line.
I mean, they they destroyed the Bud Light.
I mean, the Bud Light sales.
I think they're still way down, right.
So, you know, if enough of the populace decides, hey, we don't support what this company is
doing and we want to, you know, show that in our spending habits.
It works right.
You just need to you just need to basically have enough of the consumer, you know, Publix
rally around whatever the causes.
Right.
So to your point, like we really could do that if we if we said we didn't like what
Apple is doing.
You know, we just we're not motivated enough yet, at least for that target.
Although, I mean, worldwide, at least Apple's revenues are pretty flat.
So maybe people are starting to vote.
Right.
Well, and again, you know, this is just, you know, as consumers, we all have choices that
we can make.
And, you know, we can look at the bottom line.
These companies depend on our our our spending and is, you know, if we're willing to sacrifice
or we're willing to be inconvenienced, you know, when the best things that we could do,
if you really want to solve the problems in the United States is stop buying from companies
like Target and Wal-Mart and, you know, other big retailers, Dick's Sporting Goods, Nike,
and start buying from your local retailers instead.
Or your local retailers.
Exactly.
Yeah.
And all of a sudden you're going to, you know, if you shift your dollars and yet it's inconvenient
because you can't shop online.
Right.
Instead of doing everything online and ordering everything from Amazon, get off your ass and
drive down to some local retailers and buy the stuff that you need.
They're going to love you for it.
It's going to benefit your neighborhood.
Right.
We talk about these these disenfranchised neighborhoods.
If you want to really help your neighborhood, go shop with your local retailers in your
neighborhood because that revenue goes to them, yes, for their products.
They pay their employees who then spend that money in your neighborhood and it makes the
neighborhood better.
But, you know, we're too lazy because now it's easy just to doordash everything and
order everything from Amazon, get two day delivery, whatever it is, that's convenience.
But if we were willing to be inconvenienced a bit, then the economies that we live in
would be much better.
This is one of the things that people look back and they go, well, you know, in the 60s
and the 70s and the 80s, you know, GDP growth was running at six, seven, eight percent.
And it's because back then everybody shopped their local neighborhood.
There weren't these big, massive companies to go shop from.
So everybody shopped their local neighborhoods and it supported their local neighborhoods.
So, you know, we have these choices.
We just don't want to because we're lazy.
That is true.
That being said, you know, these these big companies, as we've talked about, you know,
they they have lobbied a lot to slant the playing field further to their advantage.
Certainly the pandemic, you know, completely accelerated this where they were the deemed
essential operations and all those local businesses got shut down and a lot of them died on the
vine.
Right.
And having outsourced a lot of our domestic manufacturing and made it harder for local
small businesses to exist, you know, the problem with with the local economy is not much is
made locally anymore.
Right.
So you've got domestic, you know, you've got local retailers competing with guys like Amazon
for the same products.
Right.
And Amazon's got massive economies of scale.
Right.
So it's you know, it's rough.
It's a system where there's now a lot of disadvantages to local guys.
And I say this as somebody who was until recently on the board of a buy local nonprofit in my
county, which has a, you know, like competing local currency that, you know, only benefits
local retailers, and does a lot to basically promote local local business.
So I'm a huge, huge fan of what you're talking about.
So anyways, I agree with you, you know, everybody, you know, be willing to be a little more inconvenienced
for the benefit of your local community and good things will happen.
Right.
Well, you know, again, you brought up a great point about outsourcing and all this is that
if we shop more local, it would create more jobs and more manufacturing locally.
Now again, you know, none of this, you can't just you can't just, you know, flip the switch
and say tomorrow I'm going to do this and it's going to fix everything.
This will, it took us a long time to get, it's like, you know, getting overweight didn't
happen overnight.
Losing weight's not going to happen overnight, but if we made changes to how we operated,
we could heal up a lot of the disenfranchisement of the economy and start to even out the scales
once again.
But again, we're not willing to do that because we have to two problems.
The first is, well, I'll do it if you do it first, right?
That's a big problem.
So nothing ever gets done because everybody's waiting for somebody else to take the lead.
So you know, that's the one problem, but then problem is that we just don't really have
the time to be inconvenienced because we're so busy doing whatever we're doing.
You know, we still have the time to do these other things and you know, the, but these
are choices that we make and we're seeing those choices that we've been making really
ever since 2007 when Facebook became a thing ever since then, things have been deteriorating
at a much more rapid pace.
And the gap between the rich and the poor is getting wider and wider at a much more
rapid pace because of these actions that we're taking.
So agreed.
Although I'm not, look, I've done a lot of love for Facebook and I think that there's
a lot of you know, social damage that they've done.
Oh no, no, I'm not saying, I'm not saying that.
What I'm saying is not just, I'm just saying Facebook was the really kind of that first
demarcation of everything being online, the internet of things, right?
That was the, that was really kind of that, that, that demarcation where Facebook was
the leader.
Then everything on the internet of things really kind of came after that.
You know, Apple smartphones came out around 2007 2008 and at that point we'd just been
migrating more and more to being online all the time.
So I'm not talking about meta in particular, I'm just saying this whole transition to being
online 24 seven every single minute of our day.
I'm right there with you.
And look, we could, we could rant on that all day long.
Where I'm going with this is, is this, you were talking about the, the, the wealth gap.
I think even more here, it's, it's the federal reserve and it's our policies, our monetary
and fiscal policies that are, I think at the root of this now there's a lot of things that
pile onto it, like what you're talking about.
And one of the challenges is, is as the prospects, and this is why I talk about the plight of
the middle class all the time here, the working class as the, as their prospects get increasingly
diminished.
Right.
And the problem is, is one factor you didn't mention that's really important is price,
right?
So as they get more and more pinched, they're like, look, I maybe I'd love to buy locally,
but I got to buy from Amazon cause it's the cheapest price I can get.
Right.
And they kind of get corralled into the slaughter shoot that nobody wants to be.
But when you're just making the decision at any one point in time, it feels like the only
decision you can make given your personal situation.
Right.
Right.
No, and that's, it's a fair point.
And again, you know, the whole federal reserve thing started in 2008.
So again, my point 2007, this all started but you know, you're right.
Is that, and we talked about this before, is that we talk about, you know, inflation,
how we export inflation to import deflation in this whole idea of manufacturing locally.
We're going to re-onshore manufacturing and all these type of things.
It sounds great in theory, but we just can't afford it because again, when you've got to
start embedding all of the cost of, you know, 17, 15 hour in wages or $22 an hour minimum
wage or whatever it is that you want and the cost of benefits and healthcare and everything
else that that US employees want, the cost of manufacturing locally just becomes too
egregious and I can't sell a product for enough to make up the difference.
And that's why we still have to export so much of our labor in order to keep our costs
down so we can sell the products we want to sell.
Yeah.
And we're trapped in this, which is like, we've been talking a lot in this channel recently
about you know, eating out and I've actually done a fair amount of Twitter polls on this
right now and it's pretty clear to me we're at like a tipping point where people are like,
I'm kind of done.
Right.
Like, yeah, maybe it'll be a special occasion once in a blue moon, but like, it just costs
way too much to go and get a freaking sandwich these days.
Right.
And I've railed about the $35 BLT in my area.
Right.
But that's an extreme case, but if you're going to go get like a regular sandwich and
a drink, you know, you're paying basically almost sort of twice what you were paying
like six years ago.
Right.
And a lot of people are just saying like, I'm done.
I take my family out for dinner, you know, and all of a sudden I'm dropping 150 bucks
or whatever.
Right.
Come on.
And then, of course, that and then everything you do now, everybody's spinning around the
computer screen going, Hey, I need a tip.
Right.
Yeah.
Like, give me 22% on top of that crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And to your point, like, I mean, what's driving that increase largely, you know, in food is
not the input cost of the food, which are going up, but it's the labor cost, right?
The labor cost has gone up so much.
Right.
And so we get to these points where it really almost becomes prohibitive.
So, you know, I know we're kind of maybe talking out of all sides of our mouth where it's like
buy local, but like don't spend too much money on something that doesn't have enough value
for the price.
Right.
But, but we have to fix one to eventually fix the other.
Right.
No, look, and this is look, there's, there's no solution that's pain free.
And this is the, this is the problem that we have is that we all, we all want to rail
about these different issues, right?
We have too big of a deficit.
We spend too much money on this.
We do this, we do that, this other thing, we all want to complain about these things,
but we all want a pain free solution.
And there's not one, you know, if you want to fix the debt, if you want to fix social
security and Medicare, it's fixable, but it's not pain free.
You're going to have to cut your benefits.
You're going to have to retire later.
It's just, there's, it's just math.
We're not producing enough children to support the system.
And now we have this big ramp up in retirees that people are just bailing out of the system,
which from an actuarial table is a big problem because, you know, all these pensions, whether
it's corporates or whether it's the government social security program, et cetera, depends
upon a certain rate of retirees in order to fund those benefits.
Well, if you have a big, a big, you know, release of retirees and all of a sudden a
big surge, well, that completely messes up all your actuarial tables.
And this is the problem we have with, you know, what's going on with, with this.
But again, there's no pain free solution to this.
Yes, we can fix a lot of these problems.
You know, we can shop local and we can take away power from Amazon and Apple and Google,
but it's not pain free.
And you know, this is, but at some point we have to make some decisions.
I mean, if you want to fix problems, you either have to elect people that are willing to fix
the problem or you're going to have to start fixing the problems yourself.
I mean, that's it.
Other than that, you just have to wait for the clock to run out and then everything blows
up and then you fix it from there, which is how things have historically always occurred.
Right.
Right.
Which is, you know, obviously the way when it's breaking down, you're always kicking
yourself saying, well, why didn't we do it?
We fixed this before.
Right.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, look, there's so many things I still want to talk to you about, but, but we're over
our time and thank you for hanging out here with your voice, where it is real quick, note
a couple of things.
I want to ask you a lightning round and a couple of quick questions.
So one, not a question, just to comment next time, I hope we can dive into your recent
piece about social security and the challenges it faces.
That's an important piece.
You just touched on it right there.
There's a lot to dive into.
I just want to note as sort of a teaser for people when social security started, I think
it was something like there were 45 workers to one retiree, something like that.
42.
42.
Yeah.
So, okay.
It's now like around two to one.
Yeah.
Right.
So to your point about the system that that's just breaking under the weight of the imbalance
between productive workers and retirees, that is a staggering stat, right?
So we're going to dive into that hopefully more next week.
So we didn't talk about the fed at all.
Folks, if you want to deep dive into what was discussed at the latest fed release in
the Jerome Powell press conference, go watch the video that I recorded right after that
all came out with Axl Merck.
We go into all of it.
But I just wanted to give you a chance, Lance, to say anything material about it that you
thought folks should know from your side.
Really it was pretty much as expected.
It was a non-event.
They did change one line in their statement to employment remains strong.
They had been expecting employment to moderate.
So employment room has remained strong, so they did change that one line.
What I thought was most interesting, and again, the three rate cuts that was already kind
of in their projections.
The only two things that really kind of were interesting is that the fed came out and said,
yeah, they'll pay attention to the dot plot because that's just us talking behind the
scenes, right?
So we pretty much downplayed the fact that they kind of increased their inflation expectations
a bit in the dot plot.
Again, what's important to understand about those dot plots and more importantly about
the fed's projections is they're always wrong.
They're never right.
And they're always too optimistic.
So I track this, I track these quarterly notices that they come out with and I plot them into
a graph, but GDP has been declining steadily and they're always on the wrong side of it.
So again, don't pay, he's right.
Don't pay attention to the dot plot because it's never right anyway.
But I did find it interesting that he actually just verbally said, hey, don't pay attention
to it.
But the other interesting thing was is that they did push out the projections for further
rate cuts.
So again, they're now talking about rate cuts going into 2026.
Again, when you take a look at that, it says they're going to cut rates to about three
and a half percent, that too is going to be wrong.
They wind up cutting it a whole lot more because if they're cutting to three and a half percent,
it's likely there's another problem going on in the system that they're trying to bail
out.
Okay.
The other thing that I thought was notable was he did say, hey, look, we are now actively
talking about reducing QT.
Not anything yet, but I think he's looking at that reverse repo almost drained, BTFP
now that's shut down.
And so they're trying to cushion the bite of filling the full force of QT when those
liquidity programs are no longer around.
Which I think is totally fascinating because financial conditions are now easier than they
were when they started hiking rates.
It's as if from a financial condition standpoint, nothing they've done has mattered.
Right.
And now they're worried about this lack of liquidity when there's obviously liquidity
coming out your wazoo at the moment.
And again, like I showed you the money flowing into equities, et cetera, is just running
as if we just sent checks to households again.
So again, I'd be ramping up QT right now until I started seeing an actual liquidity problem,
trying to get that balance sheet down some so that I have the ability to operate in the
future.
But that's just me.
Yeah, exactly.
I mean, there's a lot of people that are saying, why the heck are we even talking about?
Now, I will say the chart that you showed and I'm doing this from memory, but my recollection
of the equity inflows, we've talked a lot about on this channel with a lot of people
recently about how at the end of the day, it's just net liquidity inflows and those
passive inflows coming into the market.
But Michael Green, who tracks that super closely, he's the guy that coined the whole term giant
mindless robot for those passive inflows.
Last time I interviewed him about a month ago, he said, I think I'm just beginning to
see an initial indication that these flows are ending and may even be starting to go
into reverse.
In your chart you had, and it's too early to call it a trend, but I believe it ended
with them going from four to three.
I can't remember what the scale was on the Y axis.
I believe you're right.
I'm trying to see if I can pull that up here real quick.
See if you can pull that up here.
But I just want to highlight this to say if this is something that continues, then this
would be a game changer.
Like this would be a real game changer.
You are correct.
They have fallen from 4% to 3%.
So yeah, you can see that little downtick right there.
And of course, the last time it down ticked was in 2021.
Market was still doing okay.
They started rallying back up and then 2022 they peaked off and then went down through
the end of 2022.
The sport of three drop might be a wiggle.
We don't know yet.
If it's not, then that becomes a really big game changer.
All right.
Last question for you, Lance.
By the way, I've got a good rant.
I've been trying to get to the past couple of weeks.
We're just going to have to punt it yet again, but we'll get there, folks.
Last question for you, Lance, is trades.
Did you make any trades over the past week?
None.
Every week, it's the same.
The market just keeps going up.
Our portfolio is kind of tracking the benchmark index right now, which is what it's supposed
to do.
So there's not been any reason to do anything.
I want to do something, right?
But just that has not been a reason to do things.
I mean, I'd love to buy a little bit more Apple on this dip, but there's not been really
a reason to allocate any capital and we're pretty close to fully exposed.
So our portfolio is a 60/40 model basically.
And so we're about 57% equity right now.
And we've got about 10% cash in the portfolio all together between stocks and bonds.
So we've got cash to spend and our portfolio can go up to 70% equity, but without a correction,
there's just no sense in putting that capital work right now.
Okay.
All right.
Well, we'll end it there.
I'm going to let you have the last word, Lance, real quick before we do.

or in the salt mines like Lance, please show us by hitting the like button, then clicking

Just a reminder for folks that didn't see our conference last weekend and have yet to
buy the replay.
If you are interested in doing so, just head over to thoughtful money.com/conference.
You can purchase the replay there.
And if you want to know what's in it, look at my video.
I think it's two videos.
It goes on this channel where I do kind of like a 10 minute quick summary of what each
speaker was talking about, but just to underscore, it was an amazing day.
Don't take my word for it.
If folks, folks, if you watch the video, if you watch the conference, put your feedback
here in the comments and then folks can read to hear what you thought.
But from my perspective, total home run of a day.
And don't forget, if you are a premium subscriber to our sub stack, you will get $50 off of
the price of the replays.
All right.
And Oh, and speaking of sub stack, I mentioned briefly here last week about the new program
that we're putting together, where we'll be sharing each week a piece of premium content
from one of the experts that comes on this channel.
That program continues to build up a big head of steam.
I'm very excited for launching that's probably going to be out in a week or two.
So more details on it coming really soon.
But almost every day we get a new expert.
That's really interested in sharing their premium content with our premium sub stack
subscribers.
All right.
And then as we always talk about, you know if you are just a regular person with a regular
life, a regular job, have a family that, that you got to, you know, understandably give
the majority of your focus to a job that's demanding of a lot of your focus, trying to
figure out how to navigate this market, especially when things are as stretched as they are right
now can be a big challenge, sometimes an overwhelming challenge for just the regular investor who
watches the show.
That's why I keep recommending that folks work under the guidance of a good financial
advisor.
So make sure that you if you don't have one, and you feel that you would benefit from one
which I think most people viewing this video should go out there and get one.
But make sure that they're one that take into account all of the macro issues that Lance
and I talk about in these weekly market recaps and that I talked about in this channel with
every guest that comes on here weekly.
If you've got a good one who's doing all that for you, great, you really should stick with
them.
But if you don't, or you'd like a second opinion from what it does, maybe even Lance and his
team there at Real Investment Advice, then consider scheduling a free consultation with
one of the financial advisors that you see on the show with me every week to go do that
just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com, fill out the short form there only takes you a couple seconds,
you'll get personalized feedback from these guys on what they think you should do given
your situation.
These consultations are totally free.
There's no commitment to work with these guys.
Just a free public service they offer to help as many people as possible.
Lance, as always, my friend, you get the last word.
Well, have a great weekend, and we'll see you back here next Friday.
And hopefully my voice will be a little bit better intact.
Yeah, I know.
When I heard that you lost your voice, it was it was like, it was like a universal constant
just that could I didn't think could ever not be real.
Yeah, no, I wasn't able to radio for three days this week.
So I'm anxious to get back on Monday.
All right, my friend.
Well, look, thanks for hanging with us this long.
I hope your voice gets better soon.
Hope you feel better.
Everybody else.
Thanks so much for watching.
