Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart, welcoming you back for
another weekly market recap featuring my festive friend, Lance Roberts. He can't wait for this
discussion to be over so he can put his cap on and his sack and bring all sorts of holiday cheer to
the investors of the world. Lance, how are you doing, buddy? I'm good. I'm good. I am ready for
Christmas, that is for sure. All right. Well, we're going to see how this last weekly market
recap of the year goes here. Folks, you can see my hair is still wet. You can probably hear my
scratchy voice. I've come down with a pretty nasty bug, so I have not prepared at all for this. I
normally have my big list in front of me. We're just winging this one today, so we'll see how it
goes. Also, just a bit of housekeeping. This is going to be the last weekly market recap of the
year because next week, Lance and his partners at Real Investment Advisors are enjoying their
holidays, and so we're going to let everybody just spend time with their families. All right,
Lance. Well, look, honestly, I haven't even seen how the markets ended this week because I've just
been pretty much unconscious. So what happened this week? We talked about, let's just do this.
Let's just start with our chart that we kind of share just to bring everybody up today. Coming
out of October, we were at this very low point in October here. Let me zoom in here just a little
bit, and we'll just kind of take a look at the last six months. So this is just six months of
the data, but back here at the low of October, the market was extremely oversold, that we were
due for a rally, and because of extreme negative sentiment, all those type of things, we were going
to get this kind of reflexive rally market. Well, it's been one heck of a rally so far.
The markets have completely retraced everything they lost over the summer, a lot of catch-up
trade going into the end of the year. And right when we got through that kind of two weeks of
consolidation, right at the beginning of December, the markets just went sideways,
allowed the moving average to catch up, and then we kind of bounced off of that
and it made a very nice move higher. Now, we're extremely overbought on multiple metrics. The
relative strength index is above 70. We had a decent correction earlier this week. The market
sold off 1.5% day before yesterday. Now, we've completely recovered that sell-off in the last
two days, but that kind of pulled a little smidge of that overbought off. And again, with so many
mutual fund managers, pension funds, hedge funds, et cetera, kind of behind the eight ball in terms
of performance this year, there's a big need to get those assets on the books and to make sure
their portfolios are balanced into the end of the year. And this is also one of the important things
that occurred over the course of the last few weeks, in particular, and something I'm actually
kind of going over this weekend in the newsletter on the website at realinvestmentadvice.com, which
is kind of looking at different indexes and different markets over the course of the year,
how they've performed. And when we take a look at the S&P 500, it's up about 23, 24% for the year.
It'll be up over 25% for the year once we add in dividends, get total return. The equal-weighted
index, which in October, at these lows, RSP was basically negative for the year. And I've seen a
lot of very interesting analysis out. Yesterday, the last couple of days in particular, people
have been tweeting like, "People talk about this being just the Magnificent Seven rally this year,
but the RSP has gone from the 52-week low to a 52-week high in just 33 days." And that's a
true story. But if we take a look at RSP as a really good example of this, certainly the last
month or so has been terrific for RSP. You can see that we went from this very low point on RSP
back to very high levels. The problem with that, though, is that the S&P is up 25% for the year.
RSP is up about 11% for the year. So it's about at half the performance. But importantly, we did see
that rally broaden out. We saw small caps perform better. A really interesting measure of market
speculation, I like to look at it. And when you talk about speculative investors, etc., ARK,
which is Cathie Wood's disruptive technology ETF, it's up 57% for the year. It's actually
outpacing the NASDAQ this year in terms of return. However, that 57% return to all occurred from the
October lows to now. So in 33 days, that ETF is up 57%. Huge move. Yeah. So it's been absolutely
phenomenal. So we've seen this rally has indeed broadened out. But this is because of a couple of
reasons. One, again, through the first 10 months of the year, this rally was dominated by seven
stocks. So most portfolios don't own just seven stocks. So if you just think about it from a
rebalancing perspective, this has to do with yields also. Bonds were down sharply earlier
this year as interest rates went up in October. We were up about a 5% yield on bonds at that point.
So just think about this from a portfolio management standpoint. Now, most mutual funds,
pension funds, hedge funds, etc., they have a mandate to maintain some sort of balance in
their portfolio of some sort. So it's 60/40, 80/20, 70/30, whatever it is. Well, rates were
going up, some bond prices were going down. So they were underweight bonds. They were overweight,
the big mega cap sevens, just because those have gone up so much in price. Even if I just own
market weight, I own too many of them, too much of them. And then all the other stocks in the index
didn't do anything this year. Those were underweight relative in the portfolio in terms of
weighting. So what we've seen going into the year is exactly what you would expect is all this money
has to rebalance for portfolios. Bond yields have dropped sharply because there's been a big buying
impetus for bonds to bring those weights up in portfolios. And of course, there's plenty of
headlines around what's driving that, but that's what's happening. That's where the buying is
coming from. On the other side on equities, yeah, we're seeing this broader base of equities now
participate because everybody's got to buy those up to portfolio weight, whatever those are.
So once we start getting that movement going, then, of course, everybody else piles in. So
you now see the Reddit traders back into the meme stocks. We see a lot of the small cap stocks
performing. So people start chasing those. We saw options started kind of really laying in to the
Russell 2000. So that really negative sentiment we had that rebalance started the fire, so to speak.
And I was talking about this during the week on the radio show. It's very important to understand
how markets work. And when you have periods like in October, we have a ton of negative sentiment.
Everybody's talking about the end of the markets and all this stuff is going to happen. It's super
dire. We've got Israel. It's going to be World War III. You better get out of stocks. That's a
great environment to start buying. And the reason is that if I'm buying or if I'm building a fire,
right? So the first thing I want to do if I build a fire is I put all my kindling in my fire pit,
and then I stack my logs on top of it. And if you want to cheat, you squirt some lighter fluid on
top of that. So you've got everything ready to go, but you still don't have a fire. What you need is
some catalyst to cause that fire to start. So I have to strike a match and throw it on there,
and then I get fire out of it or strike a flint. It depends on how you want to start your fires.
But it has to have a catalyst. So in October, we had basically all the ingredients we needed for
a really strong rally. All we needed was some type of match to start that fire. And that, of course,
came from the Federal Reserve when they backed off their Fed rate hiking and started talking about
potentially this idea that yields and markets had done the work for them. So the markets took that
as, well, we don't need to hike rates anymore. That means rate cuts are coming. So we started
rallying the market, and then that lit the fire, and then everything else started chasing assets.
So it's been a great 33 days, 35 days now as we wrap up this week. But sustainability of this
rally is going to be a little bit questionable once we get to January because we are so overbought.
A lot of money has been put to work in more speculative areas. And so we could see after
we get in the Santa Claus rallies the last five days of the year and the first two days
of January. And once we get past that, we'll likely see a little bit of a reset in the markets
to ease off some of this really overbought condition.
All right, great. Hey, do me a favor. Go back to the S&P chart here.
Sure.
I just had seen in your top chart there, there was one of those little pink dots,
and I'm just wondering if that was a sell signal.
No, no. That's just a little highlight I used for an article I was drafting
for the newsletter this weekend. We're just really elevated here, but we're not on sell signal yet.
Okay. All right. So if we look at the S&P there, the chart there in the middle,
as you just did an excellent job of summarizing, we went from a low point near the end of October
to now basically new highs for the year, really all time highs, or we're getting close to all
time highs. We were kind of trending sideways there. And that's when you were talking on
this program about you expected some sort of pullback or that it could just churn sideways
for a while. Then the Fed came out and basically delighted the markets by basically telling them
what they wanted to hear. And your partner, Mike Leibowitz and I talked about that in depth last
week. But I'm curious, you talked about ARK being up, you talked about the meme stocks going up.
It seems like the Fed basically unlocked the cage on the animal spirits and they're out and running
now. We're seeing a lot of speculation return to the market here. So my general question is
how healthy is this market run here right now? And I'll give a little bit of context to that too,
which is I've been interviewing a couple of folks this week. The interviews haven't
launched yet. They'll all launch next week, but it's a number of folks who are beginning to tell a
pretty optimistic story about the markets. And I just interviewed Darius Dale yesterday,
who I think actually beat you, Lance, in having more charts and more data at his fingertips
and can cram like three hours worth of content into a one-hour interview. But he, like you,
primarily looks at the next three months window. He looks at it on a rolling basis.
And all his indicators are blinking green for the next three months. So he is fully allocated right
now. His model is fully invested and he's 100% out of cash at this point. So he feels like,
can't tell you what's going to happen after that, but for the next three months, this market really
looks set to run. So do you agree with him or do you think that things are getting overextended
here? Well, no, look, so you have to put things into context. So on Simplvisor, we actually just
launched a new tool. We're still in beta mode right now and we're still putting some final
tweaks on it. But what this looks at is a weekly analysis. So you've got to remember two things
when you're managing money is that duration or your timeframe is extremely important to your
outlook. Right now, the markets are extremely overbought on a short-term basis. And this is a
variety of indicators on a daily basis are very overbought. So that suggests that you're going
to get some type of relaxation, some type of pullback. You've got to work on it. We talked
about four. We use the rubber band analogy a lot, which says, hey, you stretch a rubber band, you
get to the point you just literally can't stretch it anymore without it breaking. And so to stretch
it again, I've got to let it relax so I can stretch it. So that's all we're talking about
on a real short-term basis. So once we get into January, we get a week or two, we get a three to a
5% correction somewhere in there, just enough to get that really egregious overbought condition
worked off. And then the market can rally again, right? So you kind of get buyers and sellers
rebalanced, and then we can start moving prices up again. So we have a daily money flow that we look
at for the more-- so this is our daily money flow indicator. And this gives you real short-term
signals. You get buys and sells based on real short-term fluctuations in the market. But if
you're looking for longer-term outlooks-- and I agree with Dale on this-- is that once you start
to move into weekly analysis, you start to smooth out all that short-term volatility.
And starting back at the end of October, beginning of November, when we're talking about the markets,
we're going to rally. We got a good, confirmed, strong buy signal. These tend to last for several
months before you get the next sell signal. We're not egregiously overbought yet on a weekly basis.
That's going to take a little bit more time to get there. So yeah, over the next one,
two, three months, there's really nothing that suggests that there's going to be some type of
major correction in the markets. There's no real evidence of a risk bias at this point
to the downside that should keep you out of equities. You should be invested here.
Now, I will warn you that there is a lot of speculation going on in the markets.
The markets have broadened out. That's healthy. But people are now chasing stocks that are very
vulnerable-- vulnerable-- I'll spit that out-- to much larger corrections because they're very poor,
fundamental companies. And the crashes that we kind of repeatedly see in these meme stocks
and things like that, that's going to happen again. So when this rally ends, those stocks like ARK,
those kind of ARK ETF type stocks-- I'm not picking on the Cathie Wood, it's just her ETF--
it's a very good representation of those poor quality fundamental companies that are a story
stock rather than a fundamental investment. Those will correct more than the S&P or a good basket
of dividend yielding stocks that have good quality fundamentals. So it depends on your time-- again,
going back to the original part of this-- it depends on what you're buying, what your duration
is. I mean, if you're a day trader, buy the crap stocks. Those move the most. So if you're trading
daily, buy the stuff that has-- don't worry about fundamentals. You buy stuff that has momentum.
If you're an investor wanting to grow your money safely over time,
worry about the fundamentals less about the momentum.
Some of the other discussions that I've had over the past week have been with folks who
really track liquidity. And I know you and I have talked about this a number of times, Lance.
But an interview that's going to come out-- in fact, I think it's coming out the day after
this interview launches-- with Michael Howell, who liquidity is his bag. That's what he just
spends all his time looking at. He's really optimistic. He maps out liquidity cycles and
has correlations and zillion different charts. But basically, they lead him to believe that
net liquidity is going to continue rising. It reversed from contracting through 2022,
reversed around October of 2022, right when the market bottomed. It's now been rising since then.
He basically sees it rising through 2025. So he's actually like, look, I think the economy is going
to do well. And I think the markets are going to do really well, probably for the next two years.
And I'm emphasizing this because a lot of other folks on this channel who've been worried about
recessions and the lag effect-- and I've been beating that drum a lot myself-- I just think
we need to be cautious. As you always say, Lance, you've got to just look at what's happening versus
what you think should happen. And guys like him, guys like Simon White from Bloomberg also,
we talked a fair amount about liquidity. Yeah, and as long as that tide of liquidity
is rising, man, that's a hard thing to fight if you're bearish. So I know you have your own
measures of this. You're pulling it up right now. So I'm going to let you respond.
No, no, it's absolutely right. Look, this is a big conundrum, right? Because
we have the leading economic index. It's been negative for 20 months in a row.
It is the second longest streak of negative prints for the leading economic index on record outside
of the 2008 financial crisis, yet there's no real sign of a recession. We take a look at other
economic indicators. Yield curve inverses suggest that we should be having a recession, yet there's
no real evidence of recession. The Atlanta Fed just updated their GDP print for the fourth quarter,
now 2.7%, 4.9% for the third quarter. So in order to get to a recession, right, we've got to wipe
out 2.7% of growth and get to negative growth for two quarters. So you've got a lot, and we talked
about this before, it's kind of like a car rolling down the hill. Right now you're in the process of
rolling down the hill. You've got to get to the bottom of that hill before you get to the
recession. Well, we're still in the process of going down that hill, and this is going to take
longer to get to this kind of recessionary outcome than people think. But from the liquidity
standpoint, yeah, liquidity is actually improving. And if the Fed is going to potentially reduce
interest rates, right, borrowing costs by cutting the Fed rate three times next year,
the market's expecting six, then that's going to certainly spur consumers to go out and start
borrowing money. It supports the housing market because people can get a cheaper mortgage.
All of a sudden you kind of start putting a floor under the housing market. That's going to help
stabilize the economy a good bit. So, you know, and then you still have all this money that's
coming in from a variety of different fronts, whether it's, see if I've got a quick chart on
that. I'm going the wrong direction here. Yeah, so two things here. Let me show you this chart
to this point. I've got to make this a little bigger. So this is GDP versus an economic
composite. So this is the economic composite of wages, rates and inflation versus GDP. So
when you measure, when you want to talk about inflation or if you want to talk about rates or
if you want interest rates or if you want to talk about wages, these all are a function of economic
growth, right? If I've got weak economic growth, then inflation and interest rates are going to be
lower. Wages are going to come down because the reason I've got weak economic growth is because
I've got lower wages and people aren't spending as much in the economy. And if they're not spending
as much in the economy, then there's not that much of a demand for loans. People are starting
to pull back. So interest rates have to come down in order to get loans processed and inflation's
coming down because now I've got an oversupply of goods and services trying to sell to a smaller
demand equation. So I have to bring prices down for that. So that's why there's a very high
correlation. And you and I have had this conversation over the last couple of years,
you know, people expecting that inflation is going to resurge and we're going to go back. You know,
we were going to go to 15, 20% inflation is going to be the seventies again. And you and I discussed
why that can never be the case because of the debt that we have in the economy now. And the
solar rates of economic growth are going to lead to that. So the economy is definitely slowing down.
Take a look at GDP is definitely declining. Not surprisingly, the economic composite tracking
right along with that, as you expect. But importantly, we're still very still very elevated.
So in order to get to that recessionary territory, we still have to fall a pretty good ways to get
back to zero. Then we've got to get into negative territory to say we have a recession. So this is
one of the things that's been kind of confounding people a bit is because we're not getting into that
recessionary territory. If you take a look at M2 as a percentage of GDP, you know, it's still
extremely elevated. It's higher today than it was during the financial crisis. So we just have this.
We have just posted a couple of charts this morning on Twitter showing the amount of money
flows into cash, bonds and stocks. It's amazing. It's like, where's all this money coming from?
Well, it's coming from the CHIPS Act. It's coming from the Inflation Reduction Act. It's still the
stimulus checks that are out there. You know, there's just so much money that has been pushed
into the economic system that this liquidity is still just floating out there. Now, if the Fed's
going to start cutting rates, which I'll admit kind of baffles me at this point. But if they're
going to start cutting rates without a recession, that's just going to fuel this kind of support for
the economy, which is going to keep it out of recession for longer than we think.
All right. And look, you just mentioned you're a little bit baffled by Powell's decision. So,
like I said, I had a nice long talk with Michael last week about
that Fed meeting. But now that we got you, Lance, like, what did you take away from it?
Well, you know, it was interesting because in September, right, they come out with their
economic projections, et cetera, and they say, look, you know, they basically left the meeting
saying, look, we don't need to hike rates because the market, the decline in the stock market and
the rise in bond yields have done our work for us. And that was really kind of the right thing to do
at that point is like, hey, we'll just stop here. We'll let the markets and bond rates do their
work. And then that should slow the economy down and get inflation under control. So, you know,
if I was Jerome and I'm not the Fed chair, obviously, but if I was Jerome Powell in December,
I would have stuck with my guns. I would have come out and said, hey, we're still worried about
inflation. The reversal in the stock market and the bond market have brought yields down. That's
that will potentially spur inflationary pressures in the economy. So we're going to keep to our guns
here. And, you know, we may need to hike if the markets keep coming down, you know, going up and
bond yields keep coming down. We may need to hike, you know, one or two more times here to make sure
we've got inflation under control. But he didn't do that. I mean, he completely said boo about it.
And they reduced their projections on interest rates for next year down, you know, three quarters
of a basis point for so three rate cuts. And the market was like, that's all I needed to hear.
Yeah. Because, you know, I wrote about this, I believe it was last week, but, you know, I wrote
this article talking about Pavlov's experiment. I know you have talked about this before, but,
you know, for 13 years, we've trained investors that when the Fed cuts rates, you buy stocks. Now,
this is an interesting point because, you know, if you look at the data and you look at the history
of Fed rate cuts, you know, what you should take away from that is every time the Fed cuts rates,
the stock market goes down. Why? Because they're cutting rates. Why are they cutting rates?
It's because there's a recession or some type of financial event, which is why they're cutting
rates, which is why the stock market's going down because of repricing for that recession,
slower economic growth, etc. The problem, though, is that now for 13 years, we've been training
investors that every time there's a sign of trouble, they're going to show up, you know,
Lone Ranger is going to show up with, you know, high-hose silver and they're going to cut rates
and do QE and boost stock prices. So I don't want to miss out. Right. I need to be in there before
that happens. I don't want to miss the rally in the markets. So now we've potentially pulled
forward all that activity and people are just like, you know, I'm not worried about it. I know
the Fed's going to bail it out. I'm just going to run stock prices up. I think the Fed's got
themselves in a very tough position, you know, you know, by kind of allowing the market to now
take control of the narrative. They run the risk if they come out and say, OK, whoa, whoa, whoa,
we're going to we're going to hike rates. I mean, you're going to cause a big problem in the market,
so they can't do that because that'll hurt the banks. So, you know, they now run the risk of
losing a lot of credibility in terms of their inflation fight. So if inflation comes back here
a bit and it will, we're going to get an uptick in inflation. It's just a function of the year
over year math that's going to occur at some point. We'll see inflation take up and then
everybody's going to go, well, what are you doing? Inflation's coming back. Why aren't you hiking
rates? You know, this is going to cause a real problem for the Fed. I don't know. But that's not
you know, this probably isn't a twenty twenty four problem. It's probably a twenty twenty five,
twenty, twenty six problem for the Fed. OK. And, you know, there's there's we are
going to remember, too, there are always elements of the story in terms of the inflation fight that
are not under the control of the Fed. So, for example, in the week we're talking here, Lance,
right. We've seen shipping traffic through the Suez Canal basically stop. Right. Yeah,
they're going around around the hornet. Right. They're going around the hornet. Right. So,
you know, so those ships will still get where they need to go. But that's at like a 40 percent
increase in cost and time. Right. And that's just inflationary. Right. So you can't do anything
about that. Yeah. But you got to be really careful about that narrative. I've seen that thrown around
a lot. Where those ships are going and those products that are delivering, we buy very few of.
So those aren't going to be inflationary on us. So, you know, again, so you've got to be
real careful. And that's a very small chunk of the overall economy in terms of the transactional
business. So it's not the big. And look, I will agree with you that is inflationary, obviously,
if I've got to pack on 40 percent more. But that's not going to feed into our economy as much as a
lot of people are trying to make it out to be. It may be. And I think it's 12 percent of world
trade. So, you know, not it's not nothing. But it's my point is, is there are factors like that
that are outside of the control of the central planners. Right. So Powell can have a plan.
But to the extent that we have things like that happen, there's really not much you can do.
Right. Yeah, no, absolutely. And that's going to happen. I mean, there's going to be something
that happens next year. That's. You know, economically changes the dynamics of things.
And, you know, this is going back to our example about the fire, which is, you know, you can have
all the ingredients mapped out. Right. You know, everybody right now is making their
predictions for next year. Market's going to go to fifty four hundred, fifty two hundred,
whatever it is. It's all bullish from here. And there's certainly plenty of case to be made for
that. I will tell you that anything that you have interviewed people on over the last year is not a
threat. And the reason for that is, is that the markets have already factored it in. If you think
housing's a threat, it's not. Markets have already factored that in. If you think it's, you know,
inflation, you know, that's not going to be the trigger. It's already factored into the markets.
Markets are aware of all these things. What gets. And that's the important part, because markets
are all about sentiment. So as long as the markets are aware of something, that's not the issue you
have to worry about. As is always the case. I'm going to give you a really good example of this,
but is always the case. It's an unexpected event that nobody knows. And the reaction to that
unexpected exogenous event is, I don't know what this is. I don't know what it means. I've got to
sell now and figure it out first and then I'll come back. But I've got to protect my capital. So
you have this big revulsion of selling all at once as the markets try to process this unexpected
exogenous event. Good example. 2018, the Fed's hiking interest rates. And in September, they
said we're nowhere near the neutral rate and the market sells off 20% into December. President
Trump comes out. We're all talking about how he's going to fire Jerome Powell because he's
hurting the economy by keeping these interest rates too high. And then December, Jerome Powell
pivots and is like, OK, we're done. We're at the magically overnight months. We're at the neutral
rate. Everything's wonderful. And so the markets take off running. Then in June, right, everything's
fine. The economy's fine. Everything's fine. We're rolling along. The world's wonderful.
And all of a sudden, kind of out of the blue, the Fed cuts rates. And they cut rates about three
times. No big deal. But then in September, I'm writing an article about the National Federation
of Independent Business. And I'm looking at all these indicators from the small business segment
of the economy that are just ringing recession alarm bells across the board. And again, there's
really nothing out there that's going on. There's nothing that people are pointing to to any major
degree that's a problem. We have all these recessionary indicators that are triggering
off saying, hey, we're going to have a recession. Of course, that was a very unpopular opinion at
that point because there was nothing wrong. But yet in the background, in September,
starting in September, the Fed starts doing this massive repo operation. And nobody can figure out
why we're doing this massive repo. And we can't figure out why overnight loans are now going to
8%, 9%, 10% for AAA collateral. But we find out later now, months down the road, we found out it
was Citadel that was having problems and others. But all this operation was going on in the
background. So here's the point. People will now tell you that nobody could have seen the pandemic
coming and that caused the recession. Had it not been for the pandemic, we wouldn't have a
recession. The problem with that story is, is that all of the kindling and everything was in place
for a recession, we just didn't have the catalyst. We didn't have the trigger. And that trigger was
basically the pandemic when it showed up. And all of a sudden, it just all kind of compiled into
this one point. But all the signs were there for a recession, but you had to have that event.
And so as we go into 2024, everybody's now kind of rolled out. There's going to be no recession
next year. It's going to be a soft landing. I'd be a little careful with that narrative
because we have all of the underlying indicators for a recession. We just don't have the trigger.
And that trigger may or may not come. We may not have some exogenous event that pushes the
economy off into a recession, but have the economic underneath the surface to allow it
to happen if it occurs. So you've got to maintain some bit of risk control and some bit of bias
towards understanding there is risk out there while you're long stocks. And that's a very tricky
thing to do for people because I've got to be long and bullish right now because stocks are going up.
But at the same time I'm doing that, we're watching very carefully for that change of sentiment,
change of attitude, change caused by some exogenous catalyst that we're not aware of
that trips this market up literally overnight. And you have a fairly big downdraft.
All right. So great. You're taking it right where I wanted to take this. Can you talk a little bit
more about your current process at RIA in terms of how you're entering the new year managing money?
You know, my recollection from the many of these weekly market recaps we've done over the year,
Lance, is that you have been kind of increasingly becoming more and more deployed.
Yeah. Since September, yes.
Yeah, since September. And now it looks like the lights are flashing green, at least for the next
couple of months. So you want to participate in that. But you just talked about, you've got some
concerns about the kindling that we have here. And so you don't want to be caught by surprise if
indeed there is some sort of exogenous event that proves to be some catalyst. So how are you
navigating that right now in terms of your allocation decisions?
Well, so right now we're almost fully allocated. We did some tax law selling in late November.
So we've got a little bit of cash on our books right now. But this market hasn't really given
us a good opportunity to deploy that cash. It hasn't made any difference. Our performance has
been basically tracking the index, which it's supposed to do anyway. So we're able to sit on a
little bit of extra cash because the portfolio is doing its own job right now. And that's been very
thankful to the drop in yields and bonds. They've been really helping support the portfolio return
since October. But once we get into the new year, if we get a little bit of a pullback, kind of work
off some of this overbought condition, which we will, markets don't go straight up, they don't go
straight down. There will be a point that markets will give you a pullback and we'll deploy the rest
of our cash. And until we start seeing indicators that suggest that there is a bigger risk, then
we're probably going to stay pretty fully allocated until we start to see that. Again,
I agree with Darius. You can't really predict anything out more than about a month. Three
months is too long for me. I kind of look at things one month at a time. But over the next
month, other than us being extremely overbought, there's nothing out there that suggests you're
going to have a real big drawdown in the market. And that's the problem with big macro views. Even
talking about recession, the risk of using a macro view of an oncoming recession as a means to manage
your portfolio is very flawed because you can't time that event. It's subject to too many different
variables that you have no control over. So using macro views to drive portfolio allocations is
always going to leave you either too exposed or underexposed relative to the market. So focus on
what the market's doing. The price of the market tells you everything you need to know. The trend
of the market tells you everything you need to know. The market's been bullish since October of
2022. So we've been bullish for 15 months. It's been a very nice market. But it's not going to
always stay that way. We're going to have another, like this summer, we had a 10% correction. We're
going to have another one of those at some point next year, most likely. And that'll be a time that
we have to re-evaluate things. Is this 10% correction just a correction? Or is it something
more? Is something going on that's now really starting to impact the economy as something
happened? Are we seeing a real big drawdown in wage growth or something like that? And then we
can start to decipher if this is just a correction or if this is the start of the next kind of
bear market. But again, you have to just wait for those periods to arrive to make that evaluation.
Trying to forecast those is very problematic. So what would your counsel be to people who
perhaps didn't take your advice and they were too uncomfortable with concerns of recession?
I mean, there were plenty of times last year where it looked like, okay, we're all getting
nervous again. October was a great example of that. And they moved to cash and UST bills
were and are still really attractive place to sit in safety. So let's say somebody really
just loaded up on T-bills and we're thinking, okay, I'm going to wait until there is a big
market correction before I start deploying my cash hoard here. If they're starting to think,
oh my goodness, those recessionary odds are maybe looking lower than they were. And I just don't
want to be sitting here in cash forever. What would your counsel be right now?
Well, this kind of goes back to our discussion about bonds at the beginning of 2023.
You and I were talking about this is in 2022, people were putting all their money into cash
and we were talking about short-term T-bills, et cetera. You get a 5% yield on a short-term
T-bill. I said the mistake that people are going to make is they're going to lock themselves up in
this fixed asset for this 5% yield and then markets are going to take off and they're
going to go, oh crap, not going to sell this to go buy that. And now you're late to the game.
And this is always the problem with investing. The biggest risk to investors is psychology.
And over time, this is why investors, because of psychology, always buy high and sell low versus
what they should be doing. The problem with cash going forward is that if the Fed is going to start
cutting rates, yields on money markets are going to go down. Prices of stocks are going to go up.
At the same time, if the Fed starts cutting rates, yields are going to go lower on bonds,
which is fine if you've locked in a 5% yield on a 20-year duration, that's fine.
So now you've got your bond and it's kicking off 5% a year. If you're good with that for the next
20 years, awesome. But those yields are going to come down. So if you own a short-term, six-month,
one-year CD, T-bill, whatever it is, when that matures, your option is a near-zero T-bill or the
stock market. So you've now left yourself in an overbought market with no yield on bonds
at the very point in the curve. And this is where I'm being a little bit exaggerating here,
but you get my point, which is you're potentially going to put yourself in a position where you're
forced between two evils. And that's not a great place to be. And this is why it's always very
important to navigate the risk of the market without, and we've talked about so many times
about not making one-sided bets. It's okay to have a portion of your portfolio in cash at 5%
or T-bills at 5%. Nothing wrong with that. Absolutely great. But don't put all your money
in that because once you do that, yeah, you've saved yourself the emotional stress of potentially
a market downturn. But now you've also potentially missed the opportunity to buy stocks when they
were cheaper. They give you a much better return. And this year, as a good example, 5% on T-bills,
11% on the equal weighted index, 25% on the S&P, 53% on the NASDAQ. Where were you better to have
your money, right? This is always the challenge that we get ourselves into. And this is why
balance is important. This is why clarity is important. This is why, you know, analyzing the
data for what it is rather than what you want it to be is very important. And we've talked about
this bell curve of outcomes. Be very careful if you're sitting on those very tail ends of that
bell curve, those 2% probabilities of something occurring, that's a very tough place to be
managing your money. You need to be in that middle bell curve where about 90% of all your outcomes
are going to occur. If somebody were to reach out to you and say, "Hey, I need some help. I'm
totally sitting out there on the edge of the curve, all in cash." Just describe how you would
help them think through how to deploy it. Would you say, "Okay, great. We think you should just
take all your money and boom, go right in the center of the curve right now." I don't think
that's the answer, but how would you help them think through this? - We have to retrain their
thinking. So we put everything into ARK first. I'm joking. So, you know, look, it's a handholding,
you know, I love the way I've been with other financial firms in my life. I've built several.
And the one thing I really love about RA Advisors where we are now is that I just get to do this,
right? I just manage the portfolio and do this. Unfortunately, Danny, Richard, John, Jonathan,
all of our CFPs, which they are just fantastic individuals, they get the really tough job.
They've got to do all the handholding. And, you know, they're the ones that are on the phone with
you, you know, once a month, once a week, however often you need it, saying, "Hey, it's going to be
okay. Don't worry about it. We got this under control. We're paying attention to this. Don't
worry about that." Because it is, it's a reeducation process. You know, a lot of people
that, you know, come in, they've been watching, you know, people on YouTube or the media or
somewhere that's talking about the end of the world coming and they've got themselves so wrapped up in
this very negative bias that it's hard to get out of that. It's very tough to get out of that very
negative environment. And because the negative environment is very comforting, because there's
a lot of fundamental data to back that up, right? It's really easy to point to, "Oh, the housing
market and the recessionary indicators and this indicator and that indicator, I know I'm right
because all this data historically suggests that this is going to be the outcome. And I know I'm
going to be right." And you may be eventually, right? But the problem is, is always the timing.
And so one of our big challenges is, we've got to get you out of that warm snuggy that you're in,
that's not helping you and move you back into being a little bit uncomfortable,
a little bit at a time. And we've got to get you acclimated to being uncomfortable.
And the reason you want to be uncomfortable is because investing is not easy. It's hard.
You know, we were buying in September and October in our portfolio where the markets were going
down and everybody's like, "Why are you buying stuff that's going down in price?" Because it's
going to turn, right? You've got to buy stuff when you don't want to buy it. You got to sell stuff
when you don't want to sell it, right? This is why we do everything backwards. So we've got to move
you from that period of being really uncomfortable, being really comfortable and snug and get you into
a very uncomfortable place and then get you used to being uncomfortable over long periods of time.
And that takes a lot of work. What would your response to this
question be? I hear a lot from people. I don't really know what's going to happen, but I've got
this sort of sense of, I want to say certainty, but get these very valid concerns and I can live
with it. If I stay in cash too long, I can live with that. Yeah, I'm giving up upside, but at
least I'm not putting my future at undue risk, right? Whereas if I go stretch and then the market
event that I'm fearful of happens, man, I'm going to kick myself for having been safe and then
moving at the exact wrong time. How do you help manage that fear?
Look, that's the hardest one because we say we're okay with this stuff, right? I can't tell you how
many times in 2022 is an example. We have this client fight all the time. In 2022, clients are
like, "Hey, if I can just get 4%, if I can just make 4% of my money, I'm so happy. I'll be just
thrilled if I can make 4%." That same client in 2023 was going, "Why aren't we beating Benchmark?
Benchmark's at 25% this year. Why aren't we making 25%?" We always want what we can't have.
That's the psychology. This is why, again, the worst enemy of any investor is the investor
himself because we want everything that we think we want, but we're not willing to pay the price
for wanting that. Yes, it sounds great. This is why we have people. We have people coming to us
now. This is 2023. We saw people showing up that have been out of the market since 2009 because
they were like, "I think this market's going to crash. It's all funny money. It's all leverage.
It's all debt. We're going to have another great depression." 13 years later, they're like, "I give
up. I got to get some money working because I got to retire soon." Look, don't get me wrong. I'm not
sitting here saying you should buy and hold an index fund. That's probably not going to work
out for you either. That's really no different though than buying cash and sitting on cash.
Let me put this into finer terms to help you understand this.
If you had money invested in the financial market in 2007, I just did this analysis for
Fox Business earlier this week because we were talking about how much money has gone
into the economy. But if you had money invested in the S&P 500 index in 2007, that index, including
the 50% drawdown in 2008, had you just wrote it through, you would be up 232% today on your money.
So your $100,000 investment would be worth 232% more today, having even gone through the drawdown.
Right? Having gone through that miserable, terrible period of a 50% drawdown, you would still be much
better off today than having avoided that whole crash. Say you were a genius and you got out
January 1st of 2008 and went to cash. You would be in a worse position today because you missed
that whole rally, that 400% rally from 2009 most to now. And so it's important to try to avoid
those downturns to some degree. And that's what we do. That's our job. In 2020, when the markets
were down 35, we were down like eight. In 2020, when the market was down 20 for the year, we were
down eight, nine. Our job's not to mitigate all of the downside risk. There's no way to do that.
You're going to take on some downside risk. The job is to try to reduce that downside risk as much
as possible. So you can participate in the markets when they're rising over the long term. That's the
hard challenge. Right? That's the hard part of my job. That's the hard part of your job as an
investor is understanding that if you're going to invest, you have to accept the risk of having a
downturn. But understand that assets are going to grow over time because of economic growth,
inflation, those types of things. That's going to pair for you over time. But you've got to,
yes, I agree. You absolutely have to avoid those big 50% drawdowns so you don't make a stupid
mistake of selling out at the bottom and not getting back in the market. That's where the
damage occurs. Right. And I take from everything you're saying there, and this has always been my
advice on this channel, is that's why you want to work with a good professional financial advisor
who has good risk management tools so that you can play in the game. You can play in the market
but if things start going against you, there are defensive mechanisms in place that, yes,
to your point, the market goes down 25%, your portfolio is going to go down that year.
You're hopefully just not going to go down nearly as much as the market has.
All right. Well, look, let's wrap up the financial talk and then let's get to some of our,
not a rant, but some of our more human element topics, and then wrap this up before I totally
slip back into a coma here with this cold. Trades, what trades, if any, have you made
over the past week? None. No, I lied. Sorry. Wait. I said none. We actually did one.
Oil prices have gotten pretty oversold. And back, I don't have my chart in front of me,
but it was probably a couple of months ago, oil prices were running up. People were, oh,
yeah, I know exactly what it was, it's October. Oil prices were running up very sharply on this
whole invasion of Israel and into the Gaza Strip. And everybody's talking about oil price going 150.
And we said, hey, oil prices are way overbought here. We're going to be due for a correction.
So we need to have a, we reduced our energy exposure at that time to expect a bit of a
correction. Well, oil prices have now gotten decently oversold. And earlier this week, we
long ExxonMobil, but we also added a position in Diamondback, which is a driller. And drillers have
a much higher correlation to the price of oil than kind of the major refiners like ExxonMobil. So
we did add a position, just a trading position for oil prices is kind of a play on oil prices,
but we think that we're going to get a reflex of, a decent reflex of rally in oil prices. And that
should play out well. And then we'll probably trade that stock off probably in January.
Okay. And now that we're here at the end of the year, what kind of year has it been for RIA?
How would you summarize both your guys' performance this year and how happy
you guys with how you navigated this year? This has been a really tough year.
It's been one of the more challenging years on record. And unfortunately, it's kind of been
this way for the last couple of years because of the fact that this market was just driven by seven
stocks. So if I own most of those seven stocks, we own like five of them. And if we had our entire
portfolio in that, we would be doing fantastic. So I'd be sitting there ringing the bell. We're
up about 6% for the year. And the other drag on the portfolio, of course, was bonds this year
because we run a 60/40 allocation. So that's been kind of a weight on portfolios. We've been talking
for a while that we're expecting this reversion in yields and yields should go lower. So the way
we're positioned as we're fundamental investors, we buy companies with strong fundamentals,
we buy bonds because we believe in long-term benefits of the non-correlation of bonds,
relative stocks, providing asset protection. This has not been one of the years where that strategy
plays well. But this is always kind of a challenge. And this is a mistake that investors make often
is they look at what the market did. They look what their portfolio did and they're like, "Okay,
well, I'm going to do something different because now I'm going to jump out of all of this. I'm going
to get into this because that's what performed well last year." And that's generally not what
occurs. You generally get a reversion of whatever sucked last year tends to be a good performer this
year. That's just the way markets work. So our strategy was not in favor this year because bonds
were underperforming because of concerns over inflation. And even though our thesis is that
inflation is going to fall back towards levels and the economy will slow down and yields will play,
it just took longer for that to occur than we thought it would. The other side is this very
narrowly defined market that we have right now between the top seven and the rest of the market.
Hopefully, if that broadens out next year, then our portfolio performance will do a whole lot
better. And the way things are looking right now, if we kind of continue this in the next year,
we should do really well. All right. And actually speaking of bonds,
were you happy with Powell's most recent press conference there? Is he helping you out there?
Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, I'd go kissing right now for that comment. I think it's the
wrong decision. I think it's a terrible decision that he's making, but just from a purely portfolio
performance standpoint, hoo-ha, great. Thank you. All right. Well, look, in starting to wrap up here,
I introduced you as I think the adjective for this week and your introduction was festive.
I see you wrote a nice little holiday article on Real Investment Advice. Will you sort of talk
about the key things to keep in mind during the holiday season? I thought I'd give you
just a second if you wanted to, to share any of your key messages from that.
Yeah, no. This is a time of year that always bothers me, I think, the most. I have an annual
expungement that I do. So anybody that emails me happy holidays, I email them back and say never
email me again. And these are mostly vendors and everybody else because this is not happy holidays.
How do you have any friends? Yeah. You know what, though? It's amazing how much outreach I get on
these time of years. But the important thing is that it's not deemed politically. And then I wrote,
if you want to read this post, it's on our website now. And it's our wish to you from our advisors,
from me. But I wrote this piece because of kind of where we are in society today. We talk about
all these problems that we have and we've got this huge division between left and right. We've
got huge division between family members. I can't tell you how many people I talk to is like, yeah,
my daughter doesn't talk to me anymore because she supports Biden and I support Trump, whatever.
And they don't even talk with their own family anymore because we've allowed politics and this
whole political movement to drive a wedge between all of us. And we're so afraid to talk to one
another anymore because we're afraid we're going to hurt somebody's feelings. And so when I was
writing this post, I'll just read to you a snippet that says, while it may be deemed to be politically
incorrect these days to say such things, the meaning and spirit of Christmas should not be
dismissed. Wishing somebody Merry Christmas is not just the acknowledgement of the Christian belief
in the birth of Christ, but what has been lost in the political crossfire is the sharing of love,
joy, happiness, and the embracing of our fellow man, regardless of faith, race, or political
leanings. And, you know, that's really kind of the fact, you know, just wishing somebody Merry
Christmas isn't, you're not trying to make some political movement or political statement or
degrade them or whatever it is. Or convert them. Or convert them, right? It's just a message of
sharing joy and happiness. And God knows we need a whole lot of that in today's society. And I kind
of go into, you know, finding joy, you know, where it matters, you know, joy of Christmas is found in
reconciliation, you know, solving those, this is the time of year to say, you know what, I'm sorry.
Even whether you believe it or not, you know, try to heal some of those friendships and some of those
relationships, you know, through the joy of Christmas, you know, it's found in rejoicing,
it's found in generosity, you know, it's found in hope. And, you know, this is, you know, one of the
things that will make you a better investor, if you want to be a better investor, you've got to
be optimistic, you've got to be hopeful. Because if you're pessimistic, you're never going to make
the right decisions with your money. And it's always going to keep you in a place where you
don't generate returns, because you have a pessimistic view on how markets work. And I'm not
saying there's anything wrong with that, there are times to be pessimistic. But if you're perennially
pessimistic, and you allow that optimism to be shoved into a closet, it's going to lower your
rate of returns over time. And this is why if you ever meet a businessman that's successful, they're
always optimistic, it doesn't matter what's going on, they're like, yep, but next year is going to be
great. You know, I filed for bankruptcy this year, but next year is going to be awesome. Just wait,
they're always optimistic. And that's why you have to find in Christmas and the Christmas joy,
you always have to find hope. And, you know, and find that meaning of Christmas. And, you know,
so this is why, you know, we wish you a Merry Christmas, we, you know, I can't tell you how
I'm appreciative of all the emails you've sent me, you know, the fact that you're here every week to
watch this conversation between me and Adam, you know, two dummies in the world, but I'm glad
you're here. I'm glad you enjoy these things. And, you know, I want to wish you personally that you
your family, your loved ones are blessed with health and your hearts are filled with love and
your spirit is overflowing with a hope. And your and your voices rejoice in the spirit of Christmas.
That's my wish to you. And I wish you a very Merry Christmas and a very prosperous new year.
All right. Well, well said. Something you just said there, and you mentioned this a bit earlier
too. So being optimistic is a requirement for being a successful investor. You've said many
times in this program, market goes up like 85% of the time. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And, you know,
it's interesting, like I'm going to give an analogy here and then I'll make it hopefully
make sense. You and I talk a lot about fitness and health. And I think you've seen some of those
posts I've written in the past about the science for getting into shape. Right. And, and I wrote
those because I went through that journey myself and I've got the before photo and the after photo.
Right. And, you know, in my thirties, I was, I was definitely pretty hefty. Right. And, and the
reason why was because I mean, I've always been athletic to a certain extent, but, um, I just said,
look, I've got to support my family. And if I've got a marginal hour better, I use that to buckle
down with work, then go, you know, do something selfish, like work on my health, right. To go to
the gym. And I began realizing it at some point, you know, when I taken a hard look in the mirror,
I can't remember, maybe I went to get a physical and got some numbers that, that, you know,
we're going in the wrong direction. You know, it really began to dawn on me that like, well, no,
no, wait a minute. If I'm not around to provide for my family, uh, then that's worse, right?
Like if I ended up dying early of something, because I'm not taking care of my health,
I'm actually failing as a provider for my family. So that let me make the mental shift
to prioritize fitness and health and to see it as an altruistic investment of my time versus a
selfish one. Right. And I think what happens is, is a lot of people, and I've been guilty of this
in my life as well, is I'm a provider for my family financially. And so I've,
I've created the wealth I have. I do not want to lose it. And therefore, you know, I'm,
I'm being very conservative around it. And to your point of like, you know, if you want to grow it,
you really got to get a little uncomfortable and you've got to put it to work. And yes,
you're going to lose money at times, but, but hopefully if it's invested well,
you're going to make money more than you lose money. And over time, that's going to grow.
And then you're going to be able to take care of your family. So you could actually,
your, your provider instinct, I guess, that's what I'm saying can sometimes work against you.
It can keep you from being too conservative and you may actually may be putting you on a track
to fail for your provider goals, even though the, the instinct is a noble one where you,
you just, you know, you're, you're trying to, you're trying to safeguard what you have,
but if you're too safe about it, it can actually work against you.
Right. That's right. You know, we talk about, um, you know, being successful and, and, you know,
we talk about capitalism and, you know, the only thing that separates somebody who succeeds at
capitalism versus somebody who doesn't is the person that says, I'm willing to take that risk
to lose everything, to do this. And, you know, there's so many of these stories. It's like,
you know, I, that are out there, even, you know, you read these stories about people, it's like,
Oh, you know, I, you know, I bet I quit my job and I committed to do this. And, you know,
five years later, we're wildly successful with whatever business it is. But, you know,
it's, it's, and then there's a lot of people that go, I wish I could be like that person
and be successful and have this opportunity. The only thing that separates the person that's
wishing to be that way versus the person that has done it is taking that risk to doing it,
being uncomfortable. And, you know, getting uncomfortable is like I said earlier,
it's the most difficult thing to do, but it's the one requirement that you have to have for success.
Yeah. Um, it is a requirement for success. There are some other ones in there. I was just talking
to actually Jim Rogers last night. And, uh, you know, I've been asking this question and,
and, uh, recently in my interviews, um, right at the very end about, Hey, what's a,
what's a non-money related investment that you would encourage people to adopt in their lives.
And his was perseverance or grit. Right. And that's another big one, right? It's, it's, it's,
um, you can't quit. It's not how many times you get knocked down. It's how many times you get
back up, right. Cause you're inevitably going to get knocked down. Um, so there's a guy that
actually would love to interview at some point. Um, and I'm blanking on his name, but he's written
the book atomic habits. Um, and atomic, it means he's using that as like trying to break it down
to its simplest, most base form. And, uh, he basically just says, look, it's, it's, it's
all about just, just doing something, right? Like just, if you're starting from zero, like even just
the most minuscule step forward is progress. Right. And, uh, you know, he basically says,
you know, everything, uh, you, you pretty much achieving a goal is basically repetitions times
time. Right. And you can achieve that goal, um, by doing a few repetitions over a long period of time,
or you can do a lot of repetitions over a short period of time. Right. It's just sort of,
that's all in your control, but it's about getting those repetitions. It's about taking those steps,
doing that work. So, all right. Well, look, um, as we, uh, as we start to wrap things up here,
um, you know, it's, uh, it's been a hell of a week. It's been a hell of a year. Um, uh,
and just to remind folks, if they didn't know, um, so my mother had passed away six months ago,
my father just passed away this past weekend. Um, his was a bit of a surprise because he was
pretty healthy. I mean, he was 89. So, you know, we knew that he wasn't gonna live forever,
but he was pretty healthy. And then he got a, he and my stepmother got a respiratory, uh,
virus and, uh, and she ended up recovering, but he just kind of kept getting worse and then it just
spiraled out of control. So very sad. Um, but, uh, you know, we're doing fine. And first off,
thanks to everybody. Who's been sending me so many wonderful, kind wishes. It really is the
outpouring of support. It's just been mind blowing. So thank you. But, um, Lance here's,
here's, uh, here's something that's I've been reflecting on a lot. Um, uh, we, we just were
finishing up as obituary right now. And, um, uh, there's this idea that I've had for a long time.
I'd love to get your thoughts on it. Um, I went to a Memorial service for, um, some family friends
years ago, um, older gentlemen, and, uh, he was a nice guy, but he was, he was like a little much,
like, you know, when he came up to you at a cocktail party, you know, you could see him
coming. You'd be like, all right, you know, how can, how can I get out of this conversation,
you know, uh, as quickly as possible. Um, he just was a little kind of, just a little too intense.
Um, his heart was in the right place, but, um, he could just be a little overbearing.
And, uh, and I think to a certain extent, you know, he, he kind of picked up on that, right.
Nice guy, but, but, you know, again, a little, a little overbearing. So anyways, his Memorial
service was just phenomenal. Um, everybody who spoke picked the absolute best parts of him,
which were true, uh, and really honored him well for, for all his strengths. And, uh, you know,
I was thinking guy, if I, if my Memorial service, people say half as many nice things about me,
I'll consider it a total home run. Um, but what really struck me as I was like, you know what,
like, I'm pretty sure this guy, again, kind of knew that folks thought that he was a little much,
um, and he would have loved to have heard the things that were said about him at his
Memorial service. Like it would have meant so much to him to realize that people actually
really valued him, you know, in that way, because I'm not sure he got that kind of affirmation when
he was alive. And so it's always made me wonder, like, why do we wait until someone's passed away
to say all those things? Right. And so the idea that I've, I've had is, you know,
why don't we have like a, like a life milestone, right. Where, you know, maybe we each one of us
gets one of these in life, right. And maybe you pick the year you want it to be, or maybe it's
like, it's when you turn 60 or whatever, right. Where it's kind of like a living Memorial. It's
like, uh, you know, it's like an honor party, right. Where everybody in your life shows up
and they kind of give you your, you know, your, your, all that they share with you all the things
that they, you know, love and respect and enjoy about you. And you get to hear it and reflect it
back to them and thank them for it. Um, I don't know why we don't do that. I don't either. There's
a comp there's an interesting company here in Houston that, um, you can hire and they go do a,
he's really good at it, but he does an autobiography. He does a biography of your
parents. And so he sits down with them for hours and ask them questions about their life. And
he's really good at dragging out those stories and, you know, putting it all into video.
So it's like, you know, kind of watch like a 60 minute special of your mom or your dad
tell all those stories, but, you know, we need, you know, I agree with you. I think,
you know, you need to have that moment. We don't, we just don't do it enough where,
you know, I didn't do it. My dad, my dad had tons of stories. Uh, you know,
he's a professional tennis player and he did all these really cool things in his life.
And, you know, he would tell me little stories here and there along the way. So, I mean, I knew
them. Um, and, but, you know, I never got the whole story. I'm sure there's probably a lot
of other stuff. My grandmother is a good example. You know, she, uh, grew up during the depression.
She was born on November the 11th, 1911. She was born on armistice day. Um, but she grew up, um,
her first husband was knocked off an oil derrick in West Texas and killed. And then she, you know,
she had to, then she went to work for Henry post as, you know, the post newspaper here in Houston.
In fact, she has, uh, my mom has a roll top desk that belonged to Henry post that he used
to write the payroll checks on. And so she's got all this really great history, but, you know,
it's going to be lost once I go, you know, that's pretty much most of that history is going to be
lost. And we lose all this great history of our parents and our grandparents and those stories,
which really make and define us as individuals. And it's, you know, and unfortunately now today
we're trying to rewrite so much of history for political reasons that we're losing touch with,
you know, kind of where we came from. And as always the case, it's, you know, that,
that path, that history is what defines us. It's what makes us who we are. And it's,
and I agree with you. It's a shame that we're losing that because we don't share it.
Yeah. Um, I think we kind of got two different topics here. And I think both are really
important, which is, um, you know, trying to pass along wisdom and knowledge from one generation to
the next. Um, and what's great is there, there are more tools now than we've ever had before.
So like, I've, I'm pretty into genealogy and, uh, so, you know, tools like ancestry.com,
it's pretty amazing what you can capture there. And what's great is, is every family has the story
of like, oh yeah, uncle Jimmy was the guy that really, you know, put the family tree together,
but, but it got lost in a fire and, oh gosh, I wish we had had that right now. It's online
forever. Right. So your whole family can, can deal with it. But, um, but yeah, and even with my dad,
you know, he was, uh, you know, he was, he was of the generation where, you know,
he wasn't the world's most expressive guy. Right. And he did a lot of record keeping.
It was a pretty organized guy, but even, even still, you know, this past weekend,
my siblings and I were going through some of his stuff and we were just like,
I don't know, we don't, we don't know what half of this stuff is. Right.
And clearly he had it in a place where he valued it. And we're just like, we're not sure,
you know, we don't know if we can throw this out or not. Cause we have a good example. There was a
hunk of wood there and I was like, oh, okay, well, I guess this is something that we probably don't
need. Right. And then, uh, one of my brothers looked at it, there was like a little tiny
engraving on it. It's part of the USS constitution, you know, the oldest, uh, active, uh, boat in the
Navy, which is, so be careful what you're throwing out. Well, exactly. Yeah. And it's like, oh my God,
you know, like we've got to be super careful here. Right. So, you know, to your point,
like there's just a lot of, um, uh, I mean, we're defined by the stories of our family.
And if those don't get passed down, we're all, we're all diminished for it. Um, but just back
to the, the, the honor party for a second. I mean, I actually did this, I've been thinking
about this for years. So when my wife turned 50, I did, uh, basically put a, a request out to all of,
you know, her close family and friends to just get on their phone for a minute. Right. And just
record a short video of them saying whatever they wanted to say about her. And I strung them all
together in a nice video for her. And it was, I think one of the most personal gifts she's ever
gotten in her life. Right. And, uh, and again, anyways, I just think it's a, I think it's a
fantastic idea. See, Adam, right there is a business that you and I can start. We'll just,
we'll, we can launch this honor party company. You know, I mean, I, I honestly think so. Like,
I don't know why it's not like a, a national holiday, if you will. Right. In other words,
you know, just like, like a, like a bat mitzvah or a quinceanera or whatever. Right. It's just
that one point in your life where you get to hear all the nice things about you while you're still
on this earth. Right. Okay. All right. So if you're watching, this is Lance's and my idea,
don't steal it. Exactly. That's right. So one day where everybody tells you how much they love you
and then, oh, wait, that's supposed to be your birthday. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, look,
last part of this topic and then we'll, and we'll close things up. Um, you know, as I mentioned,
my dad, wasn't the world's most talkative guy. Um, and later in life, uh, his hearing was going,
you know, he had hearing aids and, and, you know, hearing losses it's, it's, that's a rough
condition. Um, cause it just, it just distances you from the world. Right. You just, you can be
around people, but you don't really feel like you're with them because you're not picking
up on everything that folks are saying. Um, so anyways, it just made him even less communicative.
Um, and you know, there were, yeah, I, I think there were, there were elements that were
left unsaid, you know, in our relationship and I harbored, I think a pretty unrealistic fantasy,
but that is, I thought that as he got older and sort of saw the end coming, um, maybe that might
crack open the opportunity to sort of have some of these discussions. Uh, and as I mentioned,
you know, his, his end came much swifter than he or anybody else thought. So it didn't get that
chance. So the point being is, you know, especially with those in your life, you know, who are older
and near the end, you know, don't wait for that magical moment, uh, to, to express the important
things because you, you very well may not get it. In fact, you know, human nature being what it is,
you probably won't get it unless you force the, the opening. So, um, you know, if there's,
if there's important things that you want those who are important to you to know, yeah, as awkward
as it might be, get a little uncomfortable, but, you know, pick up the phone and have those
conversations. Absolutely. And it goes back to the joy of Christmas, which is make those
reconciliations. If you need to do that, this is the time of year to do it. Yeah. And you know,
let's, I've been talking a lot about what we've been talking about here. Um, I keep coming back
to that stoic, uh, philosophy of the obstacle is the way, um, which is, uh, it is almost like a
superpower. If you get comfortable being uncomfortable with just tackling that thing
that is standing in your way that you so desperately want to avoid, run away from, um,
you know, uh, somehow just pray it magically disappears. Um, it, it never does. And, uh, if
you, if you just tackle it head on, yeah, it's super uncomfortable in the moment, but it is by
far the most effective way to actually achieve forward constructive progress. And I've been doing
a lot of that recently. And, um, you know, I don't know if I'd say it gets easier as time goes on.
It's always still awkward. It's never easy, but it is amazing how effective it is. And if, uh,
if I can give anybody watching here a little bit of inspiration, it's that if you've got,
you know, a chronic problem, um, that's been festering, you know, rather than just continuing
to let it do so, just, just put your hand on it and see what you can do. So to your point there
about reparations, right? We all have relationships that aren't going exactly the way that we would
like, and maybe we've got some, uh, some culpability and how that relationship has gone off
track. Um, you know, instead of, instead of just lamenting it, you know, make those reparations
reach out and say, Hey, look, I want things to be better. What's it going to take to make things
right. And start the new year fresh. Exactly right. So, you know, again, you know, if you
really want to make yourself feel better, just go outside and it doesn't matter who it is, walk up
to them, shake their hand, look them in the eye and then wish them a Merry Christmas. And I have
never done that. And the person failed to smile back and say, thank you, Merry Christmas, something
back. It doesn't matter. It's, it's not the words. It's just the gesture because people have,
people have a need for connection. And in today's society, because of cell phones and everything
else, we're losing that connection with other human beings. So if you really want to spread
the joy of Christmas, shake somebody's hand and wish him a Merry Christmas and you will feel so
much better about yourself after doing that. This is a larger topic. So we'll, we'll maybe
delve more deeply into it in the future. Um, uh, I talked with Michael last week about Sebastian
younger's book tribe, which really goes into kind of, you know, the science of, of how humans are
social animals and we're wired for community and connection and all that stuff. But, um, uh,
you know, we're so starved for meaningful connection in today's day and age, which is so
funny, right? Because we're such a prosperous society and for whatever reason, you know, it's,
it's become kind of the badge of success of, of not needing people, right? Getting the big house
on the Hill separate from everybody else. Right. And of course our digital devices have, have,
despite having social media on them, it made us more physically disconnected from other people
than ever. But what's so interesting is, is, uh, you know, to your point there about just going
up and talking to people like, uh, it's something that is something that, that most people feel a
lot of anxiety around, right? Like, Oh my gosh, if I was to go be intrusive and, you know, knock
on someone's door or approach somebody I'm, I'm, I'm invading their space and, uh, maybe they're
not going to respond well or whatever. Right. But what's so interesting is nine times out of 10,
you know, all people are looking for is for somebody just to open the door for them a little
bit, to be able to have that connection. Right. So if you reach out and say, Hey,
I just want to have some sort of meaningful, you know, interaction here with you.
Most people light up like Christmas tree. I mean, literally they're just like, you know, Oh my God,
I, I, we, we can, we can have this conversation. We can actually be real people like, thank you.
Right. Yeah. I, I talked, I'll try to make this really quick, but I, um, uh, I used to talk an
awful lot about this topic at a previous company that I ran. Um, and I wrote this one piece about
the power of one and, um, just the difference that one person can make in building community.
And in a personal anecdote that I slipped in there was, um, when I used to live in the place
I lived in before I moved up to where I live now, we lived in a little cul-de-sac, um, you know,
typical Silicon Valley cul-de-sac and same deal where like houses were all crunched and tight
together. And I maybe knew my neighbor's first name, but I couldn't really tell you what he did
for a living. Right. You know, it was kind of like a wave hello relationship with everybody
on the street. And, uh, and what happened was, is I started putting in, um, a raised garden bed
in the front of my yard. And one of my neighbors just sort of walked over and said, Hey,
what are you doing? And I said, Oh, well, it was probably the first time I talked to him.
And I said, well, I'm going to try to learn how to garden. He said, Oh, Hey, I'm, I'm actually a
pretty accomplished gardener. You want to come into my backyard and let me show you what I put
together. And so he did, and he toured me around and he said, look, if you need any help, you know,
I'm here to give you pointers. He's like, great. That's fantastic. And so later on in the summer,
when our gardens were actually producing stuff, we said, Hey, you know what? We should have like
a little potluck where we can bring the stuff that we've been growing in our gardens. So we pulled,
uh, some tables and chairs and a grill out into the cul-de-sac. And as people were driving home
from work, they were like, Hey, what are you guys up to? And we're like, Hey, we're having a potluck,
you know, come on by. And everybody just brought a little, you know, whatever they had at home.
And all of a sudden these like 10 households that had barely talked to one another were all of a
sudden having this great social experience. We ended up having it every Sunday night,
all summer for multiple years. Um, and it was just because, you know, of cracking that door open the
list initially just a little bit at the beginning, but basically everybody just wanted the permission
to be able to step into it. Right. Yeah. It was just, it's just funny. I tell people it's like,
you know, I've got 300,000 friends online and I don't know any of them. And this is,
this is the problem with social media. It's like, we have all these friends and we don't have any
connection with anybody. And, you know, and now we're so afraid to have a connection, right?
You're so afraid if you talk to somebody or they're going to be offended or, you know,
whatever it is, you know, we just really keep driving that wedge deeper and deeper and deeper
between the ability of, of having just any type of normal relationship with somebody.
So it is completely understandable why people are afraid, you know, to, to make the advance.
But again, this is where you've got to be willing to be uncomfortable and hey, you know what,
you may meet the one asshole that you say Merry Christmas to, and he's like, you know,
bah, bah humbug, right? He's the Grinch, you know, those guys, those people live out there
and you may run across one, but don't let that deter you because for every one of those,
you're going to have a hundred people that, you know, want that connection. They want you to
say hello. Yeah. And you know, we'll, we'll end up here. So folks can get on with their own holidays,
but there is a lot of wisdom in this, you know, being uncomfortable and not just as an investor,
but, but in life, right. You know, as we talk about social connections and stuff like people
are messy, right? You're never going to find somebody who perfectly aligns with every one
of your beliefs and values, right? People are just complex, complicated people, right? And the, the,
the, the skill is to find the good in them and the ability to coexist with people who have all
these different sorts of ideas and preferences, whatever. Right. And we, we have this so
interesting. We have this kind of dominant social custom now that is purportedly based on tolerance
and inclusiveness, but it is so intolerant, right? You know, if, if you, if you aren't towing up
behind whatever that day's conventional thinking is on topic X you're totally ostracized. And that's
just, that is the opposite of resilience. That is just a, a brittle you know, toxic way to conduct,
you know, any type of social relationship. So anyways, you know, part of this is us just
realizing that, you know what, like the world is freaking messy and it's fine. I can, I can,
I can still have a lot of respect and love for my neighbor or my friend who maybe has a different
political persuasion than me. Right. Or you know, a different view of the markets or roots for the
sports team I hate or, you know, whatever. Right. Well, no, no, no, no, no. Don't go that far.
Sports are sacred. Don't be messing with the sports.
All right. Well, anyways, look, we'll, we'll, we'll wrap it up there, but good talking Lance
in the spirit of, of the holidays and everything. Thank you for you know, laying it on the field
with me all year here both on thoughtful money and on my precursor to this channel
very much appreciate everything that you and the whole team there at real investment advisors do
have just nothing, but a ton of excitement and optimism for what 2024 holds together for your
firm for thoughtful money, for what we're going to be able to do together. Hopefully what we can
create for our audience here. So yeah, from the bottom of my heart, buddy, thank you.
Yeah. My, my pleasure too. And by the way, I totally forgot. We needed to do this
at the first of the, of the clip today. We need to remind everybody go by the website,
go investment advice.com. And if you want to come see Adam in Houston, January the 27th,
we'll have Greg Valiere coming to do a keynote speech on investing in the presidential election

But you need to make sure to bring this up next Saturday.
Okay. Absolutely will. And if folks go to realinvestmentadvice.com,

Okay. Awesome. Yeah. I'm looking forward to that for a whole variety of reasons,
but that should be a great event. And hopefully I'll be over this awful crunk by then.
You got 27 days. Hopefully you can get there.
Hopefully. Yeah. All right. Well, look, folks, in wrapping up here, if you've enjoyed today's
weekly market recap with Lance, but have enjoyed all the ones we've had early this year, please
let us know by hitting the like button, then clicking on the red subscribe button below.
So what was that little bell icon right next to it? Just a reminder, folks, too,
that I have resumed my practice of creating my Adam's Notes for the interviews that I do on this
channel. These are my cliff notes, summaries, takeaways of what I took away from each of the
major interviews that I do on this channel. If you want to get those, just go to my substack,
which is adamteggert.substack.com. There's a lot of information that I publish every week for free
on there. Although if you want the notes, those are available to premium subscribers only.
And just a quick reminder, the premium price is super low. It's like eight bucks a month right
now. It is going up at the end of the month. So if you are thinking of subscribing, I'd highly
recommend you do it now because then you'll be grandfathered in at that low $8 a month price.
And as long as you remain subscribed, Substack tells me that that's what your price will stay at.
So you stay subscribed for 10 years, you're going to get that low eight bucks a month forever. So
anyways, if you're thinking about it, go do that because we are now very quickly getting to the end
of the year. All right, Lance, look, I'll let you have the last word, buddy. Anything else you want
to say to folks as we part? Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and we'll see you next year.
All right. Everybody else, thanks so much for watching and happy holidays. Merry Christmas,
Happy Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, whatever. Enjoy your holiday time with your family. Take care, everyone.
Bye.
