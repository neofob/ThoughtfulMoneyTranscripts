Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. Animal spirits have
certainly been running wild in the stock market of late. The S&P is up over a thousand points,
roughly 25% in the past four and a half months. Is this a new era of easy gains as giddy bulls
are proclaiming, one that investors should just jump on in and make the most of? Or is this the
latest incarnation of a rational exuberance and as caution warranted instead? For insight, we're
fortunate to speak today with Jonathan Trousard, former partner and head of product at Research
Associates and now founder of Trousard Capital Management. Jonathan, thanks so much for joining
us today. Thanks for having me. Such a pleasure. This is the first time you've been on Thoughtful
Money. In fact, this is the first time I've had the opportunity to interview you, Jonathan. I'm
really looking forward to it. One of the topics I want to dive into you on this discussion is
kind of, you know, what is driving the animal spirits in the markets right now,
especially as that gets manifested by some of these story stocks like Nvidia, which I know you've been
following very closely recently. So we'll get to that soon. But if we can, let's just start
at the point I'd like to begin all these discussions with. What's your current assessment
of the global economy and financial markets? Well, that's a great question. I think it's
pretty clear that the global economy is really walking a fine line between a lot of data pointing
to, you know, a very resilient, particularly a very resilient U.S. economy, which, as we know,
is critical to the global economy and, of course, a huge amount of risk and uncertainty on a variety
of vectors, everything from geopolitics to the credit standing of a lot of major players,
whether they be sovereign or, you know, particular sectors like commercial real estate.
I think it's interesting to think about what we've been experiencing over the last four years,
particularly since COVID started as, you know, having played. I guess the way I would say it is
if you're tired, that's OK. It's been a minute. And as a result of that, I think a lot of people
are trying to process information in real time while, you know, running on fumes intellectually.
And so it's causing just a lot of confusion. The other part of it, and this is something that I was
talking to someone I respect very much in New York recently, is to recognize that the print is not
sufficient to understand the way, you know, people are experiencing reality. One of the things that I
was talking to this person about was the fact that if you look at the U.S. consumer, the U.S.
households, you say, you know, kind of everything is great. Unemployment is down. Real wages are
finally growing, you know, so on and so forth. And you say, well, why are you walking around like,
you know, the world is on fire? Why are you walking around with your head down?
And I think the reality of it is risk. Risk has been realized for a lot of people over the last
four years. And as a result of that, they're thinking about it on a perspective basis.
A good way to think about not past inflation, but for example, perspective inflation is the fact
that I don't really care what my wages are today. I'm looking at my paycheck and I'm worried that I
don't know what it's going to buy me in a year. And so in a real way, no pun intended, inflation
uncertainty is like a wage cut right now, even though it hasn't happened. So look, the reality
of it is the U.S. economy is strong and that has caused, I think, you know, some of the runway we've
seen in markets. It's stronger than we all anticipated. Certainly about, you know, 15
months ago when we went into 2023 with, you know, near a hundred percent probabilities of recession.
And so in a lot of ways we've dodged a lot of bullets. And by the way, some bullets we hadn't
seen come along, you know, before they hit us. Things like the bankruptcies of regional banks and
Silicon Valley bank and so on and so forth. So that explains some of it. The other part of it
is, and you know, this is where it's hard to, and I think we've gotten some data on that
particular front last week with the Fed. The reality of it is I think operation,
whatever, tightening at large, whether it's quantitative or real, was put on hold back
in March of 2023 when those banks went under. And so it's just, we've been kind of floating out
there with the impression that we're tightening, but not really, really. And so I think that's been
causing a lot of uncertainty in the market, which is, you know, the officials are telling us one
thing, but the reality of it is I think QE in particular was squarely put on hold back in March
2023. All right. Sorry, you said QE was put on hold back in March. I'm sorry, QT I meant.
Yeah. That's what I figured you meant. Yeah. And we've had a lot of folks on this channel of late,
Jonathan, really kind of digging into the whys of what supported the economy, what has supported
markets despite the rate hikes and QT. And it seems pretty clear that on a net basis,
liquidity has been rising all through them, that it really bottomed in October of 2022,
which is right when the markets bottomed. And as liquidity has continued to increase,
so has economic growth and so has financial asset prices. I think the big question
hovering out there in the world right now is, well, how long can that continue for?
And a lot of debate on that because liquidity is not a really easy thing to measure and everybody
kind of has their own version of how they measure it. But alongside that has been,
there's one thing about the tide rising that raises prices. There's another thing about
expectations for the tide that can cause prices to rise even further. That's multiple expansion.
So let's get right to the heart of the discussion I wanted to have with you, which is
how healthy and sustainable do you see the current stock market rally? I mentioned the fact that the
S&P is up like 25% since the October lows. In 2023 itself, the Magnificent Seven,
we're going to talk a lot about those stocks I think, they were up 106% that year. The NASDAQ
was up 54%. The S&P was up 24%. Yeah, exactly. The S&P was up 24%. And again, to your point,
nobody would have seen that coming at the beginning of 2023. We were all still in the
throes of, oh my gosh, the stocks and bonds cratered in 2022 and this inevitable recession
is right around the corner. So everybody was surprised. So let me just ask you first,
have these valuations, the current valuation state that we're at right now with financial assets,
has this been well earned or is the market pricing to some sort of fantasy at this point?
So what do we know? We know on the one hand, again, earnings and the economy have been stronger than
we anticipated. So it is very clear that part of it is just the bogey, the hurdle going into 2023
in particular was just very low and we beat it. But, and again, you mentioned that I used to be
partner and head of product at Research Affiliates. My former colleagues maintain
a website with CAPE ratios for a whole range of markets, Shiller PE ratios, which measure
valuations on a longer horizon. And I was reminded last week when I went and looked
at the most recent data that the US market, and I'm talking about US large caps,
are currently trading at the 97th percentile of all CAPE data going back to 1880.
97 isn't quite a hundred. And I think that's important to note. In fact, we were even more
stretched before the decline of the late 2022 period, but 97 is still about as high as it's been
in over nearly 150 years. So that's where you have to say, look, do I think we're in the middle of a
huge bubble? There are arguments for discounting that, but the reality of it is the valuations
really don't give you a lot of comfort should anything go badly. And again, I think that's
the way to think about it, which is we've been just, you know, as you're walking along the
street and you're skipping over a bunch of cracks and we've been skipping over, you know, more than
our fair share of cracks recently. But if we step on one, it could get, it could get ugly real fast.
And I think that's the issue with the animal spirits part of it, which is, you know, when
the bulls run, it's great, but when they start, you know, running towards you and for the exit,
it gets, it gets, you know, pretty bloody pretty fast. Okay. So let me I want to get to the actual
question of, are we in a bubble right now? Because you've actually done a bunch of academic research
in this space. Before we get there though, let me, let me just sort of stay with the markets as they
are right now. So we have these stocks, the magnificent seven that's been driving a lot,
you know, they've been the, the quarter horses, you know, pulling the rest of the market behind
them. There's some debate now is are we down to the magnificent six or five or even two or three?
Yeah. But it seems clear that the lead, the horse or the lead sled dog, whatever analogy you want
to use is Nvidia right now. Right. And Nvidia has just been on an incredible tear. Shares have
basically doubled since the start of this year. Right. So and they had a phenomenal run, you know,
in 2023. So that's on top of another amazing year. So, you know, Nvidia is the poster child for the AI
boom. Right. And I guess one question is just, you know, there's no doubt, you know,
unlike the.com boom, where some of the highest flyers had zero earnings, right, there's no doubt
there's real earnings, you know, this company is making 10s of billions of dollars. It's,
you know, it is growing its revenue at a staggering rate. But, you know, that aside,
if we just look at the valuation metrics, are they in line with the performance of the company so far,
you know, or are we getting into kind of, you know, crazy mania style valuations?
In your answer, if you can maybe talk to price to sales for Nvidia as one example.
Yeah. No, so I think it's so again, as you noted, Nvidia is a really interesting example,
because the reality of it is this company is in the right place at the right time. And by the way,
kind of got there in a semi-random way. I mean, they started with cards that were great for video
games. And then all of a sudden were great for, you know, mining Bitcoin. And all of a sudden
there's, you know, arguably the most high value application yet with AI. So that's number one,
this company has got a thing and it's real and it's been very fortunate to be the right party at,
you know, the right place, right time. And I think it's to your point about price to sales,
you know, price to revenue, there's some, you know, the number is some version of 30,
which probably actually higher now, which means that what you would have to do for, you know,
as an investor to get your money back out of this thing would be to stop all activity, all CapEx and
so on and so forth for the next 30 years. And then, you know, eventually you'd get your capital
back, which is, you know, a pretty tall order. What I think is interesting. And again, I feel
like Nvidia has been, you know, as the expression goes, renting space rent free in my head. And I
think a lot of other people as well. I think it's irrational to think that Nvidia will forever be
the monopolist in this market. That's number one. And clearly part of the excitement is it's the
only game in town today, but is it really going to be the only game in town in the next 10 years?
That seems fairly unlikely, particularly when you go back to this concept that it's going to take
30 years to get your money back. So that's number one. The other part of it is you're right. The
earnings, you know, the revenue line has been incredibly strong and these chips have been
selling at very high prices. You know, a good analogy would be, you know, you're looking at
cars on a, you know, a lot at a car sales place and all of a sudden the MSRP doesn't mean anything.
Everything's going for, you know, two, three X to price. Which we saw two years ago. Yes, no,
totally. These things really do happen. But you have to ask yourself, why are they happening and
is that sustainable? And again, at the risk of playing fundamental analyst, which I'm not,
you know, the sustainability of earnings is really important here. These things are going at a huge
premium relative to where they were, you know, like an hour ago. And it's hard to believe this is part
of the suspicion, not fact, but I think it's a reasonable suspicion. I think some of it is a
premium related to the idea that these chips shouldn't be finding their way into China,
but there is no way they're not. The data of, you know, import and export going into China suggest
otherwise. And so my suspicion is some of the premium is just the cost of getting these things
to places they shouldn't be going to. I'm just going to guess that. But even if you don't know
that that's happening and we don't, I don't. Again, I think beyond the rational exuberance
possibility, which is, which is here, I think a lot of what we're seeing with Nvidia is what I
would just, you know, again, I look at markets often because as you said, I've been a student
of bubbles quite literally since, you know, I was a baby in this profession back at UCLA,
studying some of the, you know, the biggest bubbles in history with, with Earl Thompson.
I tend to look at markets as a behavioralist. And yet I'm coming to conclude that one way to
make sense of Nvidia is to look at it as, as an efficient market kind of risk premium. And let me
give you a couple of ways to think about that. One is the one that I just suggested, which is
Nvidia really needs to have a global market for this thing to make sense from a, from a valuation
standpoint and whether or not these chips are finding their way into China today, which again,
I repeat, I don't know, though I suspect it's happening. Nvidia is living in fear and the
investors in Nvidia have got to be living in fear of a world in which, you know, the globe really
breaks into two and the addressable market isn't the world. It becomes the Western world. And,
and I think every day that we don't get to that point is a day where, you know, investors in
Nvidia's stock have got to be rewarded for the risk born, but not realized. That's number one.
I think there's some political risks too. Right now AI is in the infancy phase where, you know,
there isn't a lot of regulation, certainly not in the US that's been put in place. And so this is
kind of like best case scenario pricing where, you know, most anything is on the menu. It's hard to
imagine that we're going to be living in a no AI regulation world forever. And so I think there's
some political risk again that we don't know what that's going to look like. And then the last one
is very, very like plain vanilla, old school thinking about markets. As excited as we are
about AI chips, I believe that Nvidia has a huge amount of what I would call real economy beta.
And what I mean by that is not their correlation to the stock market, but their correlation to the
real economy. And if and when, because we know these things will happen, when the economy really
slows down and takes a hit and, you know, corporates are wondering, you know, how to make
payroll or certainly where to cut. My suspicion is, you know, US corporates will worry about those
things before they worry about investing in AI applications. And the way I would say it is the
US consumer is going to worry a lot more about where their next meal is coming from and where
shelter is coming from than, you know, use of AI. And so this is a really exciting thing that's
happening, but under the best of circumstances. And when those circumstances change, the really
exciting thing might be, you know, put on the back burner for a bit. Well, Jonathan, you're taking
this conversation where I want to take it. I'm going to ask you in a bit about your macro outlook
in terms of what you think is going to happen in the future of the economy, because you started
with the economy, US economy resilient, certainly resilient relative to most of the other major
world economies. I've had a lot of people on this program, you don't have to agree with them,
but that are saying, if you look at the headline numbers, yep, things still look pretty good in
terms of unemployment and GDP growth and stuff like that. But if you start to dig, and in some
cases not very deeply, you can certainly come up with a lot of skepticism about where things are
headed in the future. You're nodding as I'm saying this, you even said a few minutes ago,
when you have a market that's basically price for perfection, and you're stepping over cracks,
if you eventually trip on one of those cracks, you know, that could bring things down. So even
you are seeing cracks somewhere in the system, right? So I'd love to talk to you about,
well, big enchilada, you know, what do you think the risk of recession is in the near to midterm?
We'll get there, but let's stick with Nvidia just for a few minutes. So yeah,
so you just raised a bunch of risks that really don't seem to be priced into the stock right now,
right? It seems like no matter what happens, the answer is, it's a good day for Nvidia, right?
So let me just pull up a quick chart here if I can. This is a chart of Tesla, right,
which is one of the magnificent seven. It's the fallen angel right now in that group.
And you'll see here, Tesla hit a high of over 400 bucks a share right at the end of 2021.
It's now trading at about 178. So it's been more than cut in half over the past
two plus years, right? And back when it was 400 bucks a share, you know, all we heard was,
oh my gosh, you folks that aren't Tesla bulls just don't get it, right? It's not just a car company,
you know, it's a software company, it's an energy company, it's a bet on all these different things,
right? It's going to totally transform the world. And that's why Tesla was worth more than the
market cap of, you know, Toyota and GM combined and all that stuff, right? That was the narrative
that was pushing it at that time, right? And there were a lot of people at that time saying,
man, this stock is priced for better than better for perfection. And of course,
the bullish argument was, yeah, but you guys just don't understand the scale and the scope of the
market opportunity that they're going after. I feel like it's very similar today with Nvidia,
and I'm not an expert on Nvidia, right? But, you know, it seems like first, you have to buy into,
you know, AI and that we're going to start realizing, you know, value gains from
implementing AI really fast. And that Nvidia is going to be the main dog for a long time in the
space and that competitors aren't going to eat its lunch. And to your point that some of these
other risks like, you know, regulators aren't going to come in and say, hey, look, you can't
sell to the half of the world that we don't like, you know, right now and all this stuff, right?
So it very much feels like that movie is playing out again here. I'm not saying it guaranteed is,
but I'm just saying it feels very much like Tesla did back then. What are your thoughts on that?
No, I agree. And again, I think the Tesla story was probably a little bit sillier, just period.
But Nvidia has got a lot of that going on nonetheless. And by the way, if you pull up
the Nvidia chart, you'll note that, you know, Nvidia had a major, major correction the last
time around when people went from, you know, crypto and NFTs for all to crypto winter very
quickly in 2022. I don't remember exactly the numbers, but some version of down 30% or down 40%
seems. Yeah, I'm pulling it up. It's hard to see. Right. So, but if you just go to that peak
around the number 2022, what is that? 330. Call it 330. Went down to, you know, 112.
Right. So that's down 50, you know, some version of 50%. The point is that's just the stock. And
again, now to your point about the scale, it's just, it just looks flat, but it was down 50%.
By the way, sorry to interrupt, but if you can in your answer, just address this. What is the
rationale for it being worth 148, you know, let's say 150 at the start of 2023. And it's now almost
1000. Right. 940. I think the revenues, I mean, the revenues really have gone hyperbolic. There's
no question. The point is, you know, are the revenues, you know, sustainable and real and
not real in a accounting fraud sense of the term as in, you know, reliable as a go forward indicator.
And that's the challenge. I just, again, just think about the world in which we live, which is,
which is predicated on competition. In what world is, you know, is there nobody in the wings looking
at these revenues that have just gone through the roof and saying, I'd like to, I'd like to
get some of that myself and I'm going to be throwing some money at it. So just the sheer
nature of competition in the marketplace, it just doesn't seem likely that whatever's just happened
to the revenues of Nvidia is going to happen again in a sustainable way. And I think that's the way
to think about it, if that makes sense. And yes, I just think it's, again, I think the Tesla thing
was, was always, you know, extra silly. So it's hard for me to say it's just like Tesla, but there
is some of that going on, no question. And it's, if you're talking about AI, then you've got to
be talking about Nvidia. And I just don't know that that's an equivalence that, you know, is
going to hold for very long. Again, you know, I think about, and you were mentioning the tech
bubble earlier. I was thinking about how much value was created by the original tech revolution.
And I'm talking about, you know, what happened between call it 1995 and 2000. And I can only
imagine that only a small fraction of the value generated actually went to, you know, the key
players at the time. I don't care how rich people got at Microsoft. I guarantee you that it was only
a small fraction of the amount of societal wealth that was created then. And I just don't, right now,
what we're seeing is Nvidia shareholders capturing more than a hundred percent of all gains from AI
so far first approximation. Wow. Okay. That's a, that's a,
that's a big and important statement. Whereas we've seen in previous cycles you know,
everybody gets their, their bite of the value creation. But the value creation is the big,
the big pot. You're saying we estimate the value creation of this new AI boom and it's going all
to one player. And in fact, maybe even more than a hundred percent right now. Look, I'm not saying
these are actual figures. I'm saying, I think it's, it's an intellectually reasonable way to
think about it. Yeah. All right. Well, look just to make one more sort of Tesla Nvidia comparison
to get your reaction to. So, you know, Tesla again at its height, it was all right. EVs is,
is the way the world is going. You know, it's a, it's a much better car. The
new green deal is going to electrify the transportation grid. It's got nothing.
This whole sector has got nothing but tailwinds behind it. Right. And here we are fast forward
two years later. The bloom is kind of coming off the Rose of the EV market. You know, I'm not here
to denigrate it, but there's definitely been a lot of questions that have been asked about you know,
do these cars perform as well as we thought? Are they as efficient as we thought? Are they as green
as we thought? And there's a lot of arguments to suggest that they're not. So in the, the,
the laggard in this space was Toyota who hadn't really done much in the 100% EV category and stuck
with their knitting of hybrids. And it seems like the pendulum is now starting to swing back to the
hybrid space. And the hybrid might be the model that emerges here as, as, as the winning horse
in this race too early to tell, and I'm not an expert on this. Right. But I'm just saying that
the narrative isn't just EVs are, you know, the solution for everything the way that it was a
couple of years ago. So you know, one might say that well that's an open question where in two
years from now, might we be saying, Oh yeah, there's, there's a lot of things to expect from
AI and it's, it's real. And it's going to make a big difference in the world over time, but it's
not this cure for everything that it's kind of currently being sold as. I think that's right.
I think that's completely right. Clearly the thing is, is, is going to change, you know, our reality.
You know, I think it's hard to imagine a world in which, I mean, I, you know,
in which people say, nah, it really was just, you know, all kind of hot air. But right now again,
everybody it's a little bit, you know, it's a little bit, you have to look at where the
silliness is happening. And right now everybody's got an AI company and, and you know, it's a little
bit, I was, I was, I think a friend of mine was telling me recently, someone was pitching him
an AI solution for his company and he said, well, great, what does it do? And the pitch was, well,
I can do anything you want it to do. And you're like, how about you build a product that actually
helps me in my job and then you come back. You know, so I think this idea that it can do anything
has the distinct advantage advantage of being fuzzy. But the people that are actually going
to be allocating dollars, you know, that, that are, they're literally taking out of their bottom
line to improve their business is going to, are going to be a little bit more discerning than,
cool, this thing could do anything. So one of the, and again, I'm, I'm not an AI skeptic but,
but I do think that, you know, the, the hype has maybe reached levels of, of fantastical
expectations in certain areas here. And, and one, one company that, that kind of makes me
feel that way is Reddit and looking at the Reddit IPO right now. I'm curious if you have any
thoughts on that. So I know a little bit more about Reddit than the average person because I
work at Yahoo for 10 years. So I sort of know that space fairly well. And as I understand it,
the reason why, you know, Reddit became red hot and wanted to IPO to capitalize on it was,
I can't remember which AI player, but maybe it was Google, I think, approached them and said,
Hey, we want to basically license your, your archive, right? We want to, we want to,
we want to train our AI on your, your, you know, gazillions of posts from regular people,
right? It's a ton of content that, that we're going to learn from, right?
And okay, just taking that at face value, I get it, but that's a one-time game to Reddit.
When you talk about how real are these revenue, this revenue growth, right? That's a one-time hit.
And I mentioned that on Twitter and somebody said, well, Hey, I'm making license it to the other AI
players. I'm like, okay, great. They, they get a few more checks. Right. But, but, but then it's
done. It's, it's a one and done thing for them. Right. So the people that are getting all excited
about Reddit right now they're putting a big multiple on that company. And I think the multiple
part is really questionable. Now, secondarily, there's the concern I have, again, maybe knowing
Reddit a little bit better than the average person of kind of garbage in garbage out.
Right. I wonder like, what is your AI going to learn?
Like I prefer not to consume some of this stuff. And whether that's in a direct fashion or indirect
fashion through some kind of, you know, machine learning, you know, on, on it. But I think that's
right. You know, and again, part of it, look, data companies clearly have been going at a premium for
a long time. I mean, by the way, again, you going back to old foggy things that most people wouldn't
even think of as, as data companies, you know, the old MSCIs of the world or, or even some of
the index companies. So there's value in data. We know that. But to your point, you know, when,
when the data you have is just, and I, and I don't want to be overly denigrating, but potentially an
open sewer of, of human psyche in some corners you know, I'm not sure I want to be learning from that.
But most importantly the thing that is worth remembering is, is the only way in which data
truly are valuable is to your point, if they're gated and if everybody cuts the check and
everybody learns on it, then the marginal value of that, of that training ground is,
is very quickly back down to kind of, you know, the foothills because it's, it's now part of the
bloodstream. So I think to your point, if, if Reddit has value and I think to your, it clearly
AI is, is starved, but the large companies are starved for, for data they can, they can consume
without getting sued. And one of the surest ways of doing that is to buy the data. But, but that,
that, you know, again, doesn't seem, doesn't seem particularly replicable over time, which presumably
is what a shareholder would want as opposed to someone who just wants a one-time payout.
That payout is, is done. Now it's just a question of who's going to be holding the chips when,
when it happens. But yeah, I think, you know, you're seeing a lot of this stuff.
And again, I'm trying to give people credit. I'm trying to understand where it's coming from.
I think there is an existential, I think a lot of this is excitement. And, and it's easy for me to,
to, to make fun of excitement when I think it's excessive, but I think a lot of it is
existential fear. I think people are in a mind frame where they realize the world is changing.
And if they're not on the right, you know, whatever you call it, inflatable boat off of
the Titanic, they might be left, you know, in a pretty bad place. And so they're trying to figure
out how do you accrue, you know, kind of units of value before the thing really radically changes
and the order has been flipped upside down. That's so interesting that you put it that way,
just because I would, I would have said, yeah, fear is driving this, but I would have said it was
not an existential fear, but, but FOMO, right. I've just, Hey, the, the, the, the market
opportunity is concentrating, right. We've got, we've got one of the most narrow breadth markets
that we've ever had. Right. And the, the folks that are in the winning boats are making a killing,
right. And everybody else is looking around and saying, all right, I want some of that.
Right. Like, and so to me, it feels more like, Hey, I want a winning lottery ticket and there's,
there's some of these, some of these, you know, companies out there that seem to be them.
Screw what I've been told about a well-diversified portfolio, we're not stretching for risk or
whatever. I'm going to grab that thing. Right. Especially because my idiot neighbor,
idiot brother-in-law, you know, keeps bragging about how much he's made on his Nvidia or his
Bitcoin or whatever is, you know, whatever speculative asset is shooting the moon right now.
And I would have said that that was driving them less than a, Hey, the world has changed and,
you know, I got to be part of the new fancy thing, but maybe that's a flavor of it. I don't know.
Yeah. I mean, I, and by the way, again, I think they're I guess the reason I'm willing to go there
is twofold. One is I think it's too easy to make fun of your, you know, dumb brother-in-law making
money and you know, whatever. So the, the, the straight FOMO, the mean stock FOMO is just silly
and pedestrian. And, and if that's the scenario, it will resolve itself because you know, silliness
doesn't get rewarded in the long, in the long run. But I do think, and again, this is where I'm
willing to have more compassion perhaps, or just a better feel for it is forget FOMO. Maybe you and I
are coming up with a new acronym, EFO MO, which is, you know, existential FOMO. And I think in
a world in which you're looking at, again, think about everything we've lived through in the last,
you know, call it whatever, whenever you start the clock, but let's just call it COVID. Okay.
And you're saying this world is changing radically and in ways that I don't love and don't care for.
And, you know, I've been put through the ringer and now there seems to be this new thing that
may be taking you know, the economy and the, and the world in which I operate in a completely
different direction. And, and I think it's reasonable to say, again, I, I'm trying to
be educated about what I learned from looking at the big bubbles in history. Sometimes the social
order changes and when it does it, people want to make sure they're on the right side of the ledger.
It's not confusing. It's you know, it's, it's it's and so I think that's part of it. Some of it is
just straight up FOMO is like how many dollars in my account? And I think if some of it is like,
where, where am I going to be on the, on the societal totem pole when this thing is over?
Got it. And also maybe two on the corporate totem pole, right? Which is like,
just like in the.com era, everybody was scrambling to figure out how to get some digital part of
their business. There's probably a lot of that with AI right now, which is, Hey, you know,
it seems like that's where it's going. We better, we better invest big in AI now,
even if we don't fully understand it because we just don't want to be the dinosaurs in the story.
Yeah. If AI is the asteroid, we don't want to be the dinosaurs. Yeah.
I think that's right. I think that's right. And so I guess my point to you is the reason I'm, I,
I choose to think about it in those terms, at least at the margin, is that it allows me to have,
as I said, have a little more understanding and maybe, you know, it it's, I don't want to just
be dismissive of a bunch of people doing silly things because I, I, I think that, that paints
too much of a caricature and, and either scenario isn't great. You know, I'm reminded of a piece
that's someone, David Nadek, you know, wrote recently and he's like, the bubble scenario
isn't great, but like the world order changing scenario is also pretty, pretty intense. So,
you know, I think it's just, you know, if they both, if they both result in a bubble,
whatever the driving force, it almost doesn't matter. Does it? Yeah, no, I think it's just,
I mean, again, that the, the, and this is, this goes back to, you know, the way I think about
bubbles and I'm, and please don't misconstrue what I'm saying as, as being conspiratorial in nature.
It's just a mechanical thing. Bubbles are a wealth redistribution mechanism. There are people that
lose money and people that make money and that's the bottom line. It's just the reality of it.
And so I think part of it is like, who's going to, by the end of this thing,
who's going to end up with more chips and who's going to end up with fewer chips.
Okay. You're giving me so many great directions to go and we only have about 20 minutes left,
so I'm going to try to try to get through as many of them as we can. So first off,
to round out this bubble discussion, and by the way, just want to remind folks of your credentials
here. You wrote academic research back at UCLA on financial bubbles. You did this in the aftermath
of the tech bubble. So you've got a good understanding of why and how bubbles form.
You also ran product, as I mentioned, at research associates, which I think, you know,
it influences how 150 billion in assets are managed. So massive scale. So you're not just
some guy with an opinion. You're a guy who really understands the world in which he operates.
So we've kind of used Nvidia as sort of a case study here. But as you look at the market right
now, where are we on your bubble meter? Are we in one? I'm trying to be very thoughtful. I
apologize for the pregnant pause. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't want to be knee jerk about it.
I think it's really hard. I guess on a meter, you know, one through five or something, I think it's
a solid four. I think it's hard to say everything points to bubble. I think there's some things
don't. But the predominance of the evidence suggests that this market isn't priced in a
way that leads to really great outcomes for the next 10 years. How about that for a description?
You know, it's just, we know empirically, and again, as you noted, I'm a PhD economist,
and I've thought long and hard about both the theory of finance as well as with the data
inform us. This does not require a theory. This is an empirical result, which is when
valuations are high, prospective returns are lower, period. And whether that translates into,
I guess the reason I'm giving you a four out of five instead of a five out of five is I was
recently looking back at the Japanese stock market bubble of the 1980s. And that was like
super extra silly. That was like six out of five. That was the granddaddy of all, yeah.
Right. And so in a world where like the Japanese bubble happened, I can't call this quite a five
out of five because I know there's room to stretch from here. But this isn't, this is, you know,
it's going to take a lot of great fortune for these valuations to turn into, you know, healthy
returns on a go forward basis. Okay. Is it fair to say that you think we are in a late stage bubble
at this time? Late stage market. Yeah. Late stage market bubble, meaning we're getting close to the
point where the gains we've seen are not going to be able to continue. And really one of two things
are going to have to happen, either a pretty substantial correction to get prices down into
better value or a prolonged stagnation. Yeah. I mean, again, this is where, you know, the future
is unknowable. And again, I don't, I really don't want to add the intersection of humility and just
the recognition that crazy things can get way crazier. Am I here to, you know, beat the drum
that said we've seen the top? I have no way of knowing that. But I'm not excited about putting
more money in US stocks at these prices. That's where I'm headed with all this, which is given
this market environment. Is it one that somebody should say, oh no, we're only in the third inning,
so I'm going to ride this thing for a while, right? I think it's just, I think it's just
incorrect. You know, again, you have to look at things from the perspective of the structure you
have and the structure we have, which are things like historical data and market valuations and,
you know, all of that aren't suggestive that this is the beginning. They're suggestive that,
you know, a lot has already happened and a lot is already in the price.
Okay. All right. So let's see here. Let's go kind of to rapid fire. And then there's one topic I
want to flesh out with you before we wrap up. So I talked earlier about like your macro outlook
about where you think things are headed from here. You talked about, you know, Nvidia having maybe
perhaps more economy beta in it than folks are realizing at this point in time. What is your
expectation of the economy beta here? Do you think that the U.S. economy is strong and will stay
strong enough for, you know, let's look at this sort of over the rest of the year, you know,
perspective on it? Or, you know, do you feel that these cracks that you've mentioned are going to,
you know, we're going to trip over one of them eventually. I like to use the term lag effect.
You know, we've had this, this we've dramatically increased the cost of capital. And yes,
that's been cushioned by a lot of net liquidity factors, including things that the Fed has been
in charge of, like the reverse repo program and the BTFP, both of which by the way, are,
are kind of ending at this point, right? Running out.
Running out. Yeah. And so, you know, there's a good argument to be made. Definitely a big debate
to be had over it, but a good argument made that the lag effect hasn't been repealed. It's just
been delayed and it'll eventually arrive. So do you have an outlook one way or the other?
I, yeah. You know, I mean, again, and I'll, I want to be very honest about the fact that this is
about learning in real time. You know, I thought at the beginning of this year that, you know, the,
the, the predominant argument, which was soft landing, you know, had a lot of credibility.
And I think it's very clear that the cards that have been turned over since, you know,
are taking us away from some version of, of soft landing to, you know, kind of this no landing
world, which is a really bizarre world. So I thought, I thought it was, it was healthy to,
to, to have, you know, give some credence to the soft landing and by the way,
cheer for it. I mean, if we could have had it, that would have been amazing.
Who doesn't want, you know, an economy that slows just right without causing a huge amount of pain
on, on, on people that's, you know, we shouldn't want that. But it, the reality of it is inflation.
No, I think it's important to realize that a high inflation regime is also a high inflation
volatility regime. That's just the nature of it. So once inflation is high, then, you know,
the month to month prints are just going to bop around just a lot more. But I think it's hard to,
to look at the recent inflation data and not think that we're kind of stuck here. We all know the
things that are going to wash out eventually if we're lucky, you know, the OER, the you know,
the rental equivalent, so on and so forth. But I don't know about you, I drive past a gas station
every day and it's pretty clear that, you know, oil is going up and gasoline going into, you know,
the tanks of your neighbor's cars is going up, you know, all of that. So I just think we're gonna,
we're gonna live or die in a lot of ways by either just something bad happening somewhere in the
economy. And it could, again, I'm, I would be shocked if this, you know, we had heard all we're
gonna hear on the commercial real estate set of things. I just think there's a lot of losses on a
lot of books. And, and yes, the Fed has basically just backstopped the entire banking system for the
last year. But at what point does, you know, one of those things, you know, spiral again, number
one. So I think something like, you know, CRE risk could easily get us there. And the other part of
it is, you know, it seems to me like the Fed has said, all right, we're just gonna, you know,
roll out the mission accomplished banner on inflation and, and, you know, be done with it.
If, if somehow someone gets a little bit more of a spine over the next few months and says,
we're not, we're not quite there yet, then it could, the market could be in for,
for a real surprise. And therefore the economy could be in for a real surprise because,
you know, I think we've all made peace with this funding rate for a period of time.
And by the way, it's not awful. I think it's a decent place to be, to make like reasonable
economic decisions at the margin, but people weren't prepared for it. And so a lot of people
are in the red. Yeah. So if we had more time, there's, there's a lot of data that I pulled up,
especially around the signs of weakness in the American consumer. Don't have time to
go into that given the topic I want to go into here. But we'll flag that because I really would
love to bet, you know, get your thoughts on that. Cause one of the questions I have is how real is
the current economic growth rate that we have right now and not real, you know, real versus
nominal, but, but how dependable do we think this is going to be going forward? Right.
So, but, but we'll, we'll have to, we'll have to punt that off for a different day.
When we were getting ready to prepare you get on camera here you brought up a great topic that I,
given your expertise that I wanted to give the audience a chance to hear,
which is you know, you were head of product for, you know, this, this massive
research firm that, that, that influences so much in client capital.
I believe, and don't let me put words in your mouth, but I believe that you were expressing
a concern that given the froth today that there's a real incentive. One might call it a perverse
incentive for wall street, just to sell whatever it can into that. Right. And personally, I might
think something like the Reddit IPO might be a good example, but you, you mentioned a number
of different categories right now that have become very popular where, you know, you're kind of
scratching your head and saying, okay, that's great for wall street to sell those things,
but is that great for the market? You know, are the people buying these things, are they fully
cognizant of the true price of them? So if I'm capturing the spirit of this correctly,
can you just sort of elaborate on this completely? Absolutely. And, and again, you know, when I was
head of product at research affiliates, we went by our mission, which was to do things for the
benefit of investors. And so we often had requests for new products and new strategies, and we would
sit around and say, but do we believe this isn't the benefit of investors? And if we said, no,
we would just say like, I don't really care that there is, you know, you know, money in the banana
stand. So but that's the way a lot of product groups around wall street in particular in asset
management operate. If there is money to be made, I don't really think long and hard, so to speak
about what it means for, you know, whether or not this is an advisable product. I think it's all,
you know, you have to understand the incentives in the industry. So on that kind of vein and,
you know, again, there are the things that you and I think are reasonable markers of such
issues. You know, silly IPOs is a good one. Private credit being shoved into a bunch of,
you know, high net worth investors portfolios is probably another good one for another day.
But the one that is pretty obvious to me right now is what I would describe as engineered yield.
And look, there are a lot of people for whom, you know, distributions are important,
particularly as they're approaching retirement or, you know, they're in a phase of wealth where
they've made their money. They just want to get distributions out of it. And I'll give you two.
And this is where, again, understand I'm a PhD economist and I wrote my dissertation basically
on option theory. So a lot of this is option centric. And so it helps to know that to get
to the bottom line. Buy-write strategies, hugely popular in, you know, kind of wealth management
at large has been made more popular by the fact that a lot of it has been going into ETF format
recently and sucking up a lot of AUM. What's a buy-write strategy? You buy the stocks and you
write, you sell call options on top of it to, you know, spike the distributions. And then you say,
okay, that's great. That's an interesting thing if what you want to do is put a big fat distribution
yield in front of people. But then if you're really asking yourself, you know, what's fundamentally
going on here? Think about stocks. And again, start from the premise that imagine the following
conversation. Hey, these things go up a lot or they go down a lot. How about you keep the downside
and you sell me the upside. Okay. Then you say, you have one of two reactions. No, thank you.
Right. Reaction number one, reaction number two, at what price? Okay. If you're going down the path
of reaction number two, which is probably a little bit more sophisticated, but by the way, I don't
think no, thank you is a terrible default. Then you say, okay, at what price? Well, let me tell
you this implied volatility on us stocks is really low right now. You know, we can talk about
percentile, some version of into 38 percentile going back in history. But the point is these
options you're selling, you're selling for cheap on a thing that leaves you with a bunch of downside
and not a lot of upside. Is that worth it to you? That's a, that's, you know, question number one.
The other one, which, you know, kind of gets you a little bit further up, I guess the,
the food chain in, in the world where people get interested in managing your money is, you know,
in private banking and private wealth. I'm hearing a lot more about what I would describe as
structured notes and these structured notes again are, you know, some version of, hey,
you'll get 9% for the next year unless the market is down 15% or more at which point, you know,
you'll participate in the downside, which is a cute way of saying you'll lose money.
And then you say, well, okay, so these things have been engineered. It's literally in the title
structured note. And you say, well, how do you structure them? Well, it's like a treasury rate
when you're just currently earning roughly 5%. And then how do you get the, the, the difference
between five and nine while you sell a put, that's how you get to participate in the downside.
Are you excited about the idea of earning an extra 4% on top of a really healthy treasury yield
for the benefit of selling market insurance? And again, at fairly low prices today because
implied volatility is low. So this, this whole kind of short, I guess, put it under the umbrella
of short vol products seems to me like a lot of marketing departments getting really excited
about putting big fat yields in front of people. And, and those yields being finally easy to
engineer because of where treasury yields are. But leaving me rather concerned that the people
who are actually investing in those things don't get it. And when it goes badly, aren't going to be
very happy with it. Got it. Okay. So it's just, it's a little bit of a version of the, if you
don't know who the Patsy is at the poker table at you, right. Where wall street is, is amazingly
inventive in coming up with new things to sell to meet market interest or market demand. Right.
And what I hear you saying is, is they're getting very creative with these engineer
yield products, but you fear that a lot of the people that are buying them, like don't really
fully understand how they're going to work in every different scenario. And if today's current
kind of Goldilocks conditions end for this product suddenly the product could look a lot less
appealing and these people could, could be experiencing returns that they were just not
expecting. It just, yeah, I think that's right. Okay. All right. So just, you know, just one more
caveat folks about you know, wall street sort of like, Hey, we're, we're here from the government.
We're here to help. We're here from wall street. We're here to sell you a great new product.
Make sure you do a lot of your due diligence before jumping into one of these, you know,
hot new hot new products that, that wall street is pushing. All right. Well, look,
as we wrap up here I did say what kind of wanted to get to the end of, of your thoughts on, on where
the market may be headed from here. You know, you've told us, Hey, you think it's pretty
stretched, you know, four out of five on the bubble meter. And you know you don't want to be,
you're not excited to deploy fresh capital, at least into stocks at these valuations for,
for folks. This is a channel that's none of what you're going to say here, by the way, Jonathan is
individual financial advice. Folks understand that this is just for educational purposes only.
I'm going to talk in a minute about what folks can do if they want to get advice from a professional.
But you know, they're, they're just trying to figure out, okay, gosh,
given the current state of this market, then I've got, you know, I've got my financial capital.
What are some of the things that I should be considering doing with it? Obviously,
it sounds like you're saying, look, this is the time to be more defensive than offensive.
Are there potential strategy? Are there certain strategies or certain asset classes right now
that you particularly think are well suited to this environment, or maybe on the other side,
particularly ill suited to this environment? Yeah. So and again, not financial advice. This
is just looking at data and, and educating myself and sharing that education. Because I think it's
helpful to think about how returns are generated. You know, we just talked about engineered yield.
And, you know, I think a lot about reward for risk borne. And I think one asset class where it seems
to me like the reward is well priced right now. And it happens to be that I think, you know, the,
the edges of the scenarios, if you will, are pretty well understood, is a fresh, you know,
government backed mortgages. And, you know, I'm not the only one talking about it. I know some of my
friends in Newport Beach who, who live in, in, you know, fixed income land. I think you'll,
you'll know who I'm talking about. You know, I know they're talking about it a lot. And if
you think about what a, and I'm talking, I'm not talking about anything that's not government backed.
But if you think about what I just told you, which is stock market volatility, implied volatility is
very low right now. So it's not a great time to be selling options all over town. Bond interest
rate volatility is very high. And so that becomes worth thinking about. And it happens to be that,
you know, like a fanny, a fanny mortgage, a fresh one, you know, one that was just issued recently,
at some version of 6%, right, is effectively functionally identical to being along a US
treasury, roughly a 10 year treasury, and selling a call on it. Because what you know is going to
happen is if rates come down, right, people will refinance their mortgage. That's the prepayment
risk. And all we know now is that that's a real risk. Now, again, I don't know that we're going
back to a 3% mortgage world. And by the way, I'm not sure we want to go back to that world
because that means a lot of bad things have happened. But the reality of it is fresh mortgages
seem to have a pretty decent risk return profile right now. Again, not, you know, just looking at
asset classes. So that's that's one I'll leave you with. Great. That's a fresh one. I hadn't
hadn't heard that one before. Great. All right. Well, look, as we as we wrap up here, for folks
that have really enjoyed this discussion, and if this was their first introduction to you,
where can they go or follow you and learn more about you and your work? Sure. Well,
the easiest way is to go to my website, www.troussard.com. That's T as in Thomas, R-E-U-S-S-A-R-D as in
David.com. And look, I encourage you to do one of two things. If you're obviously curious about
having a conversation as to what it would look like to work together, and I can give you my
opinions about where you are today from a from a wealth management standpoint, please contact me.
There's a contact page on our website. But honestly, just drop me a line. One of the
one of the beautiful things about running a boutique wealth management firm is I want it
to be personal. So my email address is Jonathan@troussard.com, J-O-N-A-T-H-A-N@troussard.com.
But if you're not, you know, there if you don't want to have that conversation at a minimum,
please sign up for our newsletter. I put out a piece roughly twice a month. I try to be a light
spammer. I try to keep it light and interesting. And at the bottom of every one of our pages on
the website, you can just put in your name and email address and you'll be added to the mailing
list and you'll be getting the newsletter twice a month, roughly. Great. All right. And look,
Jonathan, when I edit this, I will put up the links to your website and your email
right there on the screen. You're a brave man to share your email. All right. I'm going to do
a couple of quick like 30 seconds of housekeeping and then I'm going to ask you the last question,
Jonathan, just so you can noodle on it, which is we've been talking all about financial related
topics so far. What's one non money related investment you would encourage folks to consider
adopting in their lives? So, folks, right before we get to that, if you've enjoyed having Jonathan
on would like to have him back on this program again, particularly when his bubble meter ticks
up or down next, there's some material change in it. Let him know by hitting the like button
and then clicking on the red subscribe button below as well as that little bell icon right next
to it. Just a reminder for folks, too, that everybody who is a premium subscriber to our
Substack gets my Adam's Notes summaries of all the interviews that we do on this channel, including
this one with Jonathan. One quick note. Well, we've just added an executive summary feature
to it. So, in addition to the full write up, it now begins with a couple of bullet points,
just capturing the key most important takeaways from the conversation in case of the TLDR version,
too long, didn't read version of the notes. And then so to get the Substack, obviously,
just go to AdamTaggart.Substack.com. And then lastly, to echo what Jonathan said there, and echo
what I say on every one of these programs is for the vast majority of people watching this, trying
to navigate these markets that we're in, particularly given how stretched they are,
four out of five on Jonathan's bubble meter here, can feel very overwhelming for the majority of
people. I literally just sat down with a couple that's retiring, actually have a fair amount of
capital, but very little experience never managing it themselves. Guy was an entrepreneur focused on
his business. They're feeling very vulnerable now about making sure that what they've worked
so hard to amass lasts the rest of their lives. So, I gave him the same advice I give everybody
here every week, which is the vast majority of people should be working under the guidance of
a good professional financial advisor, not just one who's good in general, but one that takes into
account all of the macro issues that Jonathan and I have been talking about here. And when you add
that requirement onto the universe, it actually starts getting much smaller than you would expect.
There's a lot of advisors out there that cut their teeth on the 2010 through 2021 era where
you could really do no wrong because of all the intervention by the Federal Reserve and the
central planners that just kept stocks moving up year after year after year. Now, we are in a
different era now, and we're now in one where valuations are super stretched again. So anyways,
make sure you're working with one that understands that backstory so that they can take all that into
their portfolio allocation for you. So if you've got a good one who's doing that for you and
implementing it for you, taking care for you as a good financial quarterback, great, you should stick
with them. They're very valuable. But if you don't have one, or you'd like to get a second opinion
from one who does, consider scheduling a free consultation with one of the ones that Faffle
Money endorses that the guys you see with me on this channel week in and week out. To do that,
just fill out the short form at thoughtfulmoney.com, only takes you a couple of seconds.
These consultations are totally free. There's no commitment to work with these guys, just a free
public service they offer to help as many people as possible positioned as prudently as possible
for what may lie ahead. All right, Jonathan, we're back to you. What is one non-monetary
related investment that you think is worthwhile folks consider?
A couple of years ago, someone mentioned to me, Martin Short's multidimensional,
whatever, life assessment method, comedian. And I think you can Google it.
The Saturday Night Live comedian, Martin Short?
Yeah. And I've been doing it for myself and I've found it very helpful. He woke up one day famous
and he realized that if he predicated how he's doing in life on the basis of whether he's more
or less famous than yesterday from the point that he was now at, it was going to make for a pretty
miserable existence. And so I came up with, I don't know if it's eight or nine categories for
himself and they truly spoke to me. It's not just how famous or rich you are. It's about how you're
doing with your friends, how you're doing with the family from which you came, your parents and so
on, the family you now have. Do you feel creative or do you not feel creative in your own professional
efforts, so on and so forth? And so I really encourage people to look up, again, I think if
you Google Martin Short's whatever dimensions of happiness or something, it'll come up.
And it's not a bad idea once in a while to try to see how you're doing on these dimensions. And look,
if you find that you derive a lot of joy from your friendships and you haven't been nurturing
them as much as you might have last year, maybe lean into that a little bit, that sort of thing.
All right. Very, very well put. And I think people are noticing on this journey of me asking a lot of
the wealth experts on this channel the same question. It seems very clear that the people
who spend the most time in the realm of money understand the best that money isn't the source
of happiness in life. It can be a catalyst, no doubt. But the things that really bring us
fulfillment and joy and when we look back at our lives and say, was it a good life?
Money is not playing the starring role. It's all these other things. And so it's great to
hear that you are adding additional validation to that. Well, Jonathan, look, this has been a
wonderful discussion. I'm so glad that you come on the program. We've now gotten to know each
other. The audience has gotten exposure to you. Really look forward to having you back on in the
future if you can make it. But the door is open here anytime. Thank you. That was lovely. I look
forward to it. Great. And everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
