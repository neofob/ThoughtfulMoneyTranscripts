Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart, welcoming you back here at the end of the week for another weekly market
recap, featuring my good and hospitable friend, Lance Roberts. How are you doing, Lance?
I'm doing great. It was great seeing you last Saturday. A lot of fun. I enjoyed you being here for our conference. I thought it went well.
And so, yeah, it was great to hang out with you for a bit by lunch.
It was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed obviously seeing you and the team, but certainly really enjoyed meeting all the people that showed up.
These live events are so valuable to me. One, just because everybody is so kind and gracious, but I try to run this channel based upon what people
care most about, and I try to listen a lot to every email and every comment and whatnot, but nothing is better than being there in person with real people
and having them tell you what they value, where they'd like to see things improved and whatnot. So great experience all around.
I really enjoyed the keynote speaker there, Greg. Maybe we'll talk a little bit about that later on here, Lance, but again, you guys took very good
care of me, hence hospitable as your introductory adjective this week. Lots of data has come out this week, and I guess before we get to just talking
about what the markets have done, maybe we get to just start with your reaction to the FOMC update that we got this week and the guidance from Jerome Powell.
I've talked about it with a few folks on this channel. I just did right before we recorded here, a few hours ago, recorded a live event with Axel Merck for the
premium Substack audience, so I've gotten fresh from Axel's download, but I'd like to see what you took away from this week's guidance.
Yeah. No, I mean, it was really pretty much in line with kind of what we expected anyway in our shop because there's no need. While the market, and we talked
about this numerous times over the course of the last several conversations with you and even talked about it last Saturday, is that when you take a
look at the Federal Reserve, and we no longer operate on fundamentals in the markets, all about what's the Fed going to do next, and the markets are
pricing in five to seven rate cuts this year, they were expecting a rate cut at the meeting on Wednesday, and we're like, there's no reason for the Fed to
cut rates here. Everything's fine. The economy's fine. Employment's strong. Wage growth is doing well. That showed up in the days of Friday's
employment report, which is going to push out a rate cut even further. The Fed's at three rate cuts this year, which is possible. The market is at five to
seven, and so they've got to somehow try to bridge that gap in between. But, you know, the conversation from Jerome Powell, there's a few edits to the
statement, and, you know, really nothing surprising. He's trying to kind of thread that dovish needle at this point. But, you know, just kind of
reiterating the same thing is that, yeah, they're probably going to cut rates, and at some point, they're going to have to start reducing their balance
sheet, but that may be a little bit further off than markets expect. So on Wednesday, markets sold off on that news, and then not surprising, and we
actually did a little bit of buying on Thursday morning, because the markets very quickly pivoted right back. It's like, okay, well, he didn't tell us
he was going to cut now, but maybe he'll still cut in March. You know, on Friday, the employment report kind of is going to push that potential rate cut
out even further.
We're going to talk about the jobs data. But Powell, you know, when he was asked, he basically said, I'm not planning on cutting in March. Like, I
wouldn't expect us to cut in March. He actually said, it's not our base case. I don't actually see us cutting in March at this point in time. And what's so
interesting is the markets, which have been pricing in all these rate cuts this year, they shrugged it off. Yeah, there was a sell off on Wednesday, you
know, as the news was coming out, but then they rebounded. And this morning, we're talking here on Friday, markets are having a great day. So we'll talk
about earnings in just a second. But what is interesting is, so it's February 2, when we're recording this, it's Groundhog Day, it kind of feels like
we're back in the old Groundhog Day where it's like, look, you know, Powell's out there playing coy, telling the markets, I'm probably not going to cut
exactly on the schedule you think I'm going to, markets saying, well, we don't really care, we're going to act as if we don't believe you. And all the
activity is going on in the mag seven stocks, and they're all doing great. And everything else is kind of lagging. I mean, it feels like we've seen this
script for a long time. And we've we've come right back to it. Yeah. And look, this has been the case, really, since October of 22. You know, it's hard to
it's hard to believe that it's been that long. But, you know, you go back to October of 2022. I'm not misspeaking. I'm not I don't mean October of 23. I
mean, October of 22. When we bought them, we bought them at that point. And ever since then, it has been a incessant rally based on the expectation
that the Fed was done hiking rates and that they were going to cut rates. And it's back to monetary accommodation. And you know, this is very fast. It's
fascinating. But it's also just a part of human nature is that over the last 13 years, we've trained investors that at the first sign or first hint of
trouble, the Fed's going to cut rates and increase liquidity to the markets. And so beginning in October of 22, and really all the way down, if you
remember, in October of 22, yeah, we were having a correction in the market. And there was the Russia, Ukraine, you know, we're gonna have World War
Three fear and there was this fear and interest rates are going to the moon fear and inflation is 9% fear. And every time the market would sell off, it
would rally right back. And it was that FOMO that we had from investors, and I would get emails like, Is this the bottom? I don't want to miss the
bottom. I got to buy the bottom. And it's very differently to what you saw in a real bear market. Again, 2012 market, it was a correction. 2008 was a
bear market. That was the last real bear market we've had. And that's an environment where you do not want to own stocks. So people, I mean, it's
like, hey, stocks are cheap, you want to buy some? Hell no, are you crazy? I don't want to own any stocks, markets going to zero. That's a bear
market. 2022 every time the market dip, it was, I got to buy the bottom, I don't want to miss the bottom, I don't want to miss my opportunity to be in
stocks when they go up and the Fed cuts rates. And so we've been rallying this market since October of 2022. All these expectations of these coming
Fed rate cuts and those type of things, you kind of have to, the obvious question is, are rate cuts priced in? And we won't know until we get there.
Or are they overly priced in?
But I mean, yeah, we're back to multiple expansion. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with this market right now. We're setting new highs on
Friday. Look, that little correction we had on Wednesday was very much needed. We talked about the markets being overbought, that you needed to
have a bit of a correction and it corrected right to the 20 day moving average, bounced off support. And now we're back up to all time highs on
Friday. So we're in that very positive feedback loop, all time highs, we get all time highs. And that's just going to keep being the case here for a
while until something does. And we're going to have a correction this year. So expect a 5 to 10% correction, I would suspect probably sometime this
summer. Markets tend to correct going into a presidential election because markets don't know who, you know, they know what they have with Joe
Biden. They're pretty confident of what they'll have if they get Donald Trump. But going into the election, you don't know which one you're coming out
with. And so markets tend to sell off going into the election until there's a determination of who the next president is going to be in the markets rally
after that, because once they know who the president is, then they OK. Well, based on him or her, whoever it's going to be. And there's some theories
that in May that Biden will be replaced by Michelle Obama. So by the time we get to November, whether it's him or her coming out of that election, the
markets quickly go, OK, I know what I'm going to get. I'm going to get Trump's elected. We're going to get tax cuts, whatever. And that's I'm going to
base my investments on that. If I have the incumbent or replacement, I know what I'm going to have with that. And so I'm going to place my bets
accordingly. So that's why you generally get a correction during the summer. And with markets very overbought right now, still we're deviated from
50 day moving averages. We're deviated from long term moving averages. You're going to get a correction at some point. What triggers that? Who
knows. But a five to 10 percent correction this year is very likely.
Alright, got plenty to move on to in here. We now are really seeing how earning season is shaping up. I want to get to our S&P chart and find out
where we are on the if we're stolen overbought territory, and if so, how overbought. Real quickly, before we move off the Fed, one of the things
that's getting a lot more attention than it normally does is the Treasury's quarterly guidance. Can you talk about that for a minute about how
markets are reacting to that, or at least how the bond market is reacting to that? Because the Treasury has been a pretty big provider of liquidity
over the past year or so, and so all eyes are looking at what it's going to do going forward. What are you taking away from its latest report?
Well, the latest report is they're not going to issue as much debt as they thought. Now remember, most of this is you hear these really big numbers
off the curve, like the Treasury is going to issue $700 billion in debt or whatever the number is. But a lot of that's just replacing bills
that are rolling off, right? So what's your actual net issuance? And turned out the Treasury's not going to have to issue as much debt, but
they're still issuing a ton of debt, but they're not going to have to issue as much. And so that was a little bit of a relief to the bond market
and one of the big concerns has just been too much debt, an oversupply of debt, you just don't have enough buyers, so rates go up. And that's not
true. But in this environment, there's plenty of buyers still for debt. So there's not a lack of buyers by any stretch of the imagination. But that's a
concern. So the issuance, the fact that they're going to issue less debt will relieve some of that pressure. Now, the news on Friday with the
employment data was a lot stronger than expected. That suggests the economy's firing on all cylinders. Wages were much stronger than expected.
So that's potentially an inflationary pressure. Bonds had gotten very, we had a very big runs in bonds this week. So it wasn't surprising to
see a little bit of a sell off on Friday in the bond market. We actually changed some of the duration in our portfolio. We have a very big
chunk of our bond, let me rephrase that, we have a very big chunk of our bond portfolio in one to three year treasuries. So we shifted about a
third of that into seven to 10 year treasuries Friday morning at the open.
All right, well, that's pretty material then, I mean, a third of what you had and
Yeah, but out of 40% of our bonding, so our portfolio 60/40, right, 60% stocks, 40% bonds, we have, out of that 40%, 15% of that was in one to
three year treasuries. So we shifted a third of it 5%. We still have 25% of our bond portfolios in very short term duration. So we talked
about needing to shift that duration longer. And as the Fed cuts rates at some point this year, doesn't matter when they do, but they will, then
rates will drop down across the long end of the curve. And so we want to be there before that happens.
Okay, okay. Yeah. But I mean, I'm just noting this, that this sounds like a decision you and your partner, Michael Liebowitz, they're made to
say, okay, you know, we're starting to move, you know, a not insignificant amount of our short duration stuff further up the curve.
Yeah. Okay. And because also, you're going to lose, you know, the yield on the one to three year treasuries is good right now. But that's going to go
away as the Fed cuts rate. So I don't want to be trapped in short duration. And plus, you get no bang for your buck on a duration basis, as
rates come down, right? They don't appreciate that much. So you kind of get a double negative in really short duration, but your one to three
year treasuries, they're fine for holding short term cash, but on a longer term basis, you don't want to be there.
Right, right. And I guess if rates do come down, you get a double benefit on the things that are further out the duration curve, you get to keep
that nice rate and you get the appreciation.
Correct. Okay, so earnings season. So we had a lot of the mag seven stocks report this week, and it seemed for the majority market really liked
what it saw.
Yeah. And interestingly enough, I mean, it is very segregated to just a handful of stocks. In fact, I just posted a chart on Twitter this
morning here. Let me share my screen. You know, if you take a look at earnings, it is a very narrow window of what companies are actually
growing earnings versus those that aren't. And so if you take a look at the forward 12 month EPS on NASDAQ stocks, and this is primarily
remember, even in the NASDAQ, it's primarily Apple, Google, Meta, etc. All the earnings growth is coming from those stocks, not the
rest of the market. So if you take a look, you know, UPS had a terrible report this week, if you take a look at most of your other stocks,
particularly your small cap, mid cap companies, they're not growing earnings, they've actually got earnings contraction. So we're chasing a
market that yes, companies are a first of all, companies are beating very much lowered estimates. And so it's great that companies are
coming in, Google had a good report a little bit light on revenue, but had a good report, but they barely beat estimates that were already
dropped dramatically from last year. So again, we dropped estimates for the S&P 500, about $8 a share, just in the last two months of
the year, and companies are barely getting over that bar. So yeah, we're growing earnings, but it's certainly not at the robust level to
justify companies trading at 30 and 40 times price to sales. You just don't have that type of revenue growth in the market. But that
doesn't matter right now. It's all about the bet.
So of course, then multiple expansion, why not?
Yeah, well, that's what and that's what you're getting. And look, markets rise. And you know, I had that chart in our presentation over the
weekend showing you know, why, you know, when you're in a secular bull market, that's a period as we are in now that started in 2009. That's a
period of multiple expansion where we continue to pay more and more and more for every dollar's worth of earnings, because we think this
cycle is just going to continue indefinitely. But you know, it eventually won't, you're going to go through a period of multiple
contraction. But you know, the problem for most investors that have never seen a bear market, they don't know what that looks like.
And so you go through a period of, you know, 10 to 15 years of a multiple contraction phase, and your rate of return on stocks is near
zero, you know, 0123%, you know, all of a sudden, it's no longer a fun place to be an investor in.
Yeah. I just want to note here, too, for when we get to the jobs data. You know, we're back in this market bifurcation, right, where it's
very few stocks that are powering the indices higher. And we're, we're seeing the vast majority of the stocks in the indices getting left
behind, right, and you talk there about EPS for those smaller stocks starting to roll over. We talked about this a bit in Houston, but is, you
know, when you look at the jobs market, and if you're concerned about it, you got to be concerned about weakness in the small to midsize
companies, because that's where the vast majority of jobs are in America, right? We look at the headlines, we look at all the big brand
names that are laying off and actually have a list I'm going to run through a little bit later. But those on a relative basis, that's not the
iceberg, that's more the tip of the iceberg, we get to worry more about the iceberg, which is the small and medium sized companies.
Well, yeah, we talked about that, you know, 50% of all your jobs come from small to midsize companies. And that's one of the big flaws with
the BLS employment report, is they survey large companies, because they're easy to get ahold of, right? So they survey large companies and
say, okay, what's your employment situation look like? Well, big companies like Apple and Google, they're hiring. But then they
extrapolate that out to small and medium sized businesses, which is that is not the case. But that's why you get these flawed numbers
and the employment data is because of that extrapolation, when you survey a small pool of one type of employer in this, okay, well, if
they're doing this, everybody must be doing it. And actually anything look at the NFIB report, which is the National Federation of
Independent Business, that is a organization of small to midsize businesses. And, you know, their outlook is pretty good. And, you know,
there's been a lot of videos out on, on, you know, TikTok, and, you know, other meet on Twitter and other, you know, social media places
lately, I've just, I got into that side of social media somehow, but I'm
They're highly reliable media sources like TikTok. Yep, keep going.
Right. Well, no, I'm just no, I'm not saying that. But these are these are these are people that make videos going, hey, I don't understand
what's going on. You know, I, you know, I hear about how great things are. And yet I've sent out 1400, you know, resumes, and I'm not even
getting a callback. And it's not just one person. This is a lot of people that are that are noting and particularly like they're they're
putting resumes out on LinkedIn, and they're getting like no responses whatsoever, even though they're supposedly all of these job
openings. So yeah, and to your point, credibility is a big issue. But, you know, again, there's just this kind of underbelly to the market.
And, you know, I've had and I've said this a couple of times on our show, and I get a lot of emails, we want Yeah, I'm having exactly the same
issue. I'm sending out all kinds of resumes. And I'm not getting callbacks.
So let's put a pin in this because I want to dig a little bit deeper into this when we get to the jobs part before we do though, can you start
pulling up your S&P chart? Because I just want to give folks a visualization of where we are right now on, you know, relative valuation side of
things. That being said, though, I do have some data here that that's going to almost turn the jobs section into our rant for the week, but it's
not because I've got some other good rants. Alright, so here we are. We're still in that uptrend. That's, you know, way above the moving
averages at this point. Yeah, it's looking like we're still in oversold territory or overbought territory, but I'll let you editorialize here.
Oh, no, no, you've got it right. I mean, you know, the top charters are kind of our primary buy signal, sell signal, etc. You know, again, we're
doing very much similar to what we and we said this last Friday is that we're, you know, this this move in the market is very similar to what we
saw in March, April, May, June, July of last year. The markets were at a very high level in terms of the MACD signal and just kind of
grinded sideways on that signal and market just kind of ground higher on expectations that you know, the world is fine. And it's all about AI
and we're back into that whole game again. It's all about AI now. And you know, every company that comes out says, Oh, yeah, we're gonna do AI
next year, you know, the market the stock just takes off. But we're into that cycle. And you know, this cycle is going to end at some point
and we're going to that's why I'm saying it probably sometime this summer, could be sooner could be, you know, March, April, May could be
May, June, July, I don't know when it's going to occur, but sometime early this year, we're going to get another five to 10% correction,
they'll just be kind of that reset that will go through, you know, the Fed's not going to hike rates or cut rates as much as we thought or
they're not going to taper QT as soon as we thought or there'll be some issue, right? It'll be just something that happens that causes
this market to cool its heels a little bit. And that'll be very healthy. We need to get this some of this overbought condition work off
this deviation that we currently have between the market and the 200 day moving average is about as egregious as it was back in July of last
year. So this big gap between the market the 200 day, that's got to resolve itself at some point as well. So again, you'll, you know, moving
averages act like gravity. So you know, kind of like we've talked about stretching rubber band is that when he stretches that rubber band,
it's going to eventually pop back to gravity and that 200 day is acting as that is that gravitational force. So it wants to pull those
prices down towards that moving average at some point and that's going to happen. Again, what causes it? Who knows, but you'll have
plenty of signal, you know, the market will start to sell off or trigger sell signal, we'll talk about reducing risk in portfolios. And that'll
probably be in the next couple of months or so.
All right, and I want to just want to take a minute here and underline your point there about reducing risk. So, you know, we'll get comments
that are like, oh, you guys, you know, keep bringing up all these bearish points, and you're missing the run in the markets and, and all that
stuff. And I just want to, like, really call out for people that, you know, we're not delivering a Hey, everybody get in the bunker message on
this channel. You know, when the market is running, the market is running, it is what it is. And I think, you know, you do a really good job
week after week of reminding us, Lance, you know, we got to deal with the markets, we have not the markets we wish we have, or we think should exist.
Right. Now, that's not to say don't throw caution to the wind, far from it. And I think it's really important to keep caution at the very forefront
of your mind. But you just want to, you want to be practical, and to say, look, you know, if the market momentum is grinding higher, for
whatever reason, whether you like it or not, if you're an investor, and your job is to make money over time, you should be asking yourself, if the bulls
are running, how can I participate in that, in a way that makes me feel comfortable enough with my risk profile? Right. And, you know, I think a good
financial advisor like you guys, Lance, you know, what you're trying to figure out how to do is, okay, how do I participate in the markets we have, and yet,
cognizant of some of these risks that we have out there, how do we do that in a way where if the market does turn suddenly, or if these fundamentals that have
not mattered for so long, suddenly start to matter again, you know, how do we do that in a way where we're not vulnerable to losing a huge chunk in a
drawdown, where we've got enough hedges, or at least enough diversification or other things in place that, you know, our expected odds are still pretty
good of riding what upside momentum remains, but limiting some of the downside impact. Yeah, and that's why. So, you know, in SimpliVizure, we're just
launched a second money flow analysis, which is what I'm showing you right now. And this uses weekly data versus daily data. And the reason this is
important is, look, the biggest mistake that investors try to make is they try to avoid all losses, right? So I don't want to lose any money. So I'm
going to get out now and then they wind up missing a big chunk of the advance. Just understand that when you invest money, be okay with losing some
money. Now, I'm not saying lose a lot. Now it's a big difference, right? But I'm okay with losing a little money, because I will have hopefully made a
bunch of money on the way up. And what this weekly indicator does, again, this is a beta version, we're going through a complete revamp of
SimpliVizure right now, we've got the new format of this is really cool. I saw it yesterday. So I'm really excited about rolling it out. But this is
one of the graphs that will get updated. But this uses weekly data. And what it does is it smooths out kind of the market dynamics to a bit. But
even, you know, you'll notice that last year as an example, the market peaked in July, you didn't get a strong sell to reduce, you know, really step
out, reduce equity risk until August. And then you avoided all the drag from, you know, in September and October, you missed a little bit of the bottom in
November, then triggered about mid November, you triggered a strong buying you've been in ever since. And so you know, what this helps do is avoid, you
know, panic selling and getting out of the market and then figuring out you got out too soon, the market's still running. And so now you've got to try
to get back in and do that. And this this analysis works with individual stocks, it works with markets, it doesn't matter, it's all the same. But you
know, the whole point of investing is trying to invest long term. And you know, we we there are stocks in our portfolio that we've owned since the
beginning, and we've we trimmed them down, we've reduced them back during risk periods, we've added to them when the risk period is over. And we, you
know, just kind of, you know, take profits and reduce risk is needed, and then add that money back as you know, as things grow. And so, you know, there's
stocks that we've owned that are that are up a lot over that period of time, because we just kind of manage that risk exposure, you know, kind of as we go
along. One thing we can talk about later is last week, we had a whole lot of people requesting an all equity model. And that would provide better
yield. So last week, we launched a dividend growth equity model. And it's kind of a unique model, because it has a lot of the S&P beta to it, but has
double the yield of the S&P. So we're beta testing that one right now. And hopefully, we'll have that out to our clients in the next month or so.
But, you know, there's just a lot of things that we can do to try to take advantage of the market that we have, but still manage risk as a function of
that process along the way.
All right, a couple of things. One, I'm sure you just perked up some people's ears. So when if a backtesting goes well on that new model, when you do roll it
out to clients, I'd love for you to just on one of these weekly market recaps, you know, tell us more about it for folks that are interested. Secondly,
when SimpliVisor, when the 2.0 version releases, same thing, maybe we'll let you give a couple minutes of a refresher here for folks on exactly what
SimpliVisor is, because I'm not sure every viewer really gets it. And it's a nice service that people don't have to become a client of yours necessarily.
In terms of having you manage their assets, they can just use the SimpliVisor tools and resources to manage their own money if they're more like a DIY
type of person.
Right. And that's really what this whole platform is for, is for the DIY investor. But you know, a couple of things that are coming out as a complete new
interface. But then also, there's about 10 portfolios that are coming along with SimpliVisor that you can invest money in and they're managed for you by
the SimpliVisor platform. So there's a lot of really cool innovation that's coming over the course of the next two, three months as we get there. But the
dividend equity model is actually live now on SimpliVisor. So I can show you some of that whenever you want.
Okay, I'm not going to do it this time, just because we got so much to go through, but we'll leave people hungry to learn about it. Just to revisit the
point I was making earlier. So I had conversations yesterday, both with Sven Henrich, as I mentioned, and with Axel Merck. And the theme of them was
both whether you like where the steamroller is going, or the direction the truck is headed in, whichever analogy you want to use, whether you're happy
about it, whether you're unhappy about it, it doesn't make sense to just stand in front of it, on principle, out of spite. It's just going to roll you
over. And the point is, one of the challenges that bears have is the entire system, the entire power structure is trying to keep the party going. So if
you're going to be on team contrarian on the bear side, you really got to be right. And you really got to have your timing pretty good too. And I'm not
saying, "Hey, don't be bearish," if that's what your analysis tells you to do. I'm just being eyes wide open that every part of the system is trying to
keep the bullish part of it going. And so you got to realize you're fighting everybody when you're taking that bearish position. And I'll give a little
preview. So the day after this video, if folks are watching this on Saturday, tomorrow, Sunday's video is the one with Sven. And you're probably going to
like the general thesis if you're a market skeptic like I am in general. And he basically said, "Look," he said, "The bears had every opportunity to
try to gain control of the markets over the past couple years." I mean, you couldn't have asked for more. You had this global pandemic, they shut down the
economy. You then had the greatest rate hike campaign in history. But they still couldn't break the market momentum. And so he's kind of saying,
"Look, I think for the foreseeable future, the bulls, like it or not, they're just proving that they are in control of this thing." And when we dug into
kind of his outlook for the year, he's definitely got some concerns about valuation and thinks that there's some uncertainties in 2024 that yeah, it's
probably going to be a bit of a bumpy ride this year from his perspective. But guys like Felix Zulauf, he's like, "Whatever happens this year that
begins to get things out of the hand of the central planners, the response is going to be so egregiously big that the resulting spike in the markets is
going to be gargantuan." So again, if you're sort of expecting this sort of bearish washout of the markets, probably not going to happen. I mean, you
might get a little bit of time where markets start to soften if something starts really wobbling in the economy, but the response from these guys, they
have proven is they're going to be early and they're going to be really big. And so again, just cautionary, who knows what's going to happen? I'm not
saying that Sven's got it exactly right, but I'm just saying more and more of these folks I talked to are saying, "Man," and he says, "I don't like this
prediction. I think we should have a recession. I think we should have a big market correction. I'm just not sure we're going to have one because bears
pretty much had the table served for them and they couldn't take advantage of it."
No, it's very true. And actually, they did in a lot of ways, they did well. Back in 2022, there was a lot of stocks that were down 70%, 80%, 90%. Meta as an
example, that stock went from almost $350 a share down to roughly $100 a share, now it's back to $450. So, there's a lot of companies got really beaten
up during 2022. A lot of companies went out of business. And now you've got that kind of tailwind of market dynamics back and face. And you know, the
thing is, it's always interesting, there's a lot of reasons to be bearish. And look, we write a lot of bearish stuff. I've got an article out today talking
about should retirees put as much money as they're doing. They're piling into equities right now. The retirees are putting a lot of their money into
equity risk right now. The whole construction of the article is should you, particularly given where we are valuation wise, etc. But the tailwinds are
behind the market. Look, it's a lot more fun to make money in the market than it is when the markets are going down. So I'm not sure why you fight it.
Just enjoy the swim while you have it.
Yeah, and I think that's what I'm trying to underscore here, which is, we tend to put ourselves either in the bullish camp or the bearish camp. And I
guess what I'm saying, Lance, and let's be music terriers, we really should aspire to be more like eagles. We really should be saying like, hey, look,
there's some bearish elements and there's some bullish elements. And I'm going to try to basically position to take advantage of both of them, seeing the
market as it is. And so yeah, I guess that's kind of my advice to people, which is if you self identify as a bear, maybe start thinking about self
identifying as an eagle. Again, I'm going to change, I guess I got to change my Twitter handle.
Well, you can use our logo if you want. You can put that on your handle.
All right. As long as your lawyer signs off, I'm not going to be copyright infringement. Okay, so much to get to, including your article about whether
retirement savers are maybe taking on too much risk in this market. But let's get to some of the other information that came out this week. So we've
referenced the jobs numbers a little bit. Let me just lay the groundwork here. So folks, the payrolls number just came out, massive blowout. 353,000
jobs were added, versus expectations of just 185,000. That was another massive sigma beat. I think this was a four sigma beat versus the analyst
expectations. Now, of course, this is where it starts getting really frustrating. To your earlier mini rant there, Lance, these incredibly rosy
numbers don't seem to be jiving with folks' real boots on the ground views and observations. And as in the past, there are two ways in which the
payroll, two surveys that the payroll analysts use to come up with their numbers here. One's the establishment survey, which is that 353,000. Then the
other is the household survey where they actually call up real houses and talk to people. Well, that one showed that jobs dropped by 31,000. So we're
beginning to see an even bigger gap between the methodologies that are used by the same organization to calculate the payroll numbers. First time jobs
actually declined by 63,000. Part time jobs surged by 96,000. So we're definitely seeing kind of a diminishing of quality of the job base here. We've
talked about this a lot. You did mention that the average hourly wage increased, Lance, but that's only because hours worked during the work week
declined. It wasn't actually that nominal wages increased. It was just they're taking that same wage for the week, and they've got a smaller denominator
now. That's correct. And it's a pretty big drop, by the way, too. It went from 34.4 to 34.1 hours. So pretty significant drop. Yeah. And then last
stat, and I'll let you take it over here. So the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7%. I did a wonderful interview with Lacey Hunt, that
folks, if you haven't watched it yet, you should definitely watch it after this one. But Lacey, these numbers don't jive what Lacey says he's seeing
from the data that he looks at. He cited a stat that 45 states that their unemployment offices are reporting increases in unemployment benefits now.
So again, we've made this comment before, I sort of feel like I'm watching the news and the meteorologist is telling me how sunny it is, but I'm looking
out the window and I'm seeing the rain. Three days, Adam, three days. That's all meteorologists are good for. Yeah, but they should be pretty good
in terms of what's happening right now. It's just that kind of like, look, you and I talk about how much faith we can put in this government data, the
data that's put out by the BLS. Is it as rosy as it seems? I'm not really sure it is, but it's ones like this where I'm like, "Come on, guys, this is
almost in the like, don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining kind of deal." Yeah, so I mean, you kind of hit it. It's interesting to watch what's
going on. So this chart I've got up right now, this is the cumulative difference between the household survey and the official BLS report. And as of this
last report, we're near a million job discrepancy on a cumulative basis over time. So it's a very interesting situation. And you've seen and people have
seen this chart before, there's this growing gap between the cumulative actual workers that are out there versus what the BLS says, and the number of
workers are actually declining, even though BLS says we're just printing these amazing amount of jobs every month. But don't forget, this is an election year,
by the way. So we still have revisions coming next year, which can be very interesting. This is the most important chart, though, that I keep going back to,
which is full time employees relative to the working age population. Now, the full time employees relative to the working age population actually
ticked up slightly in this past report. The only reason, though, that it ticked up slightly in this past report is because we lost 451,000 people in the
population, the population actually shrank by 451,000 people last month. Now, as you can see, those red bars at the bottom are very rare. That's when
population decreases for some strange reason. But the only reason that some of these numbers look better on a on a reported basis is because there was a big
contraction to the actual population change. So, you know, again, it's just one of those, normally the population kind of ticks along every, you know, every
month, we add, you know, 200,000 people to the rolls, whatever it is. This is everybody's, this is working age population, so 16 years and older. We
normally add a couple hundred thousand people a month, and then all of a sudden, last month, we just had this big 451,000 person decline. So it was just very
interesting.
Is that an adjustment? Do they periodically go and just, it's not like it happened in the past month, right?
Right. No, you can, you can kind of see that every now and then, like somebody comes in and says, oh, we need to adjust that. And that's these big red
declines. But that's the only reason. If it wasn't for that adjustment, the full time employment to population number would be a lot worse. And the
important thing about that is, is that when you see these big declines in full time employment relative to population, that only occurs as the economy is
actually going into recession. So you kind of go back and look at these previous periods, like 2008, 2019, sorry, early 2020, you know, back in heading into
2000, you see these big drops in full time employment to working age population, because this is where companies are going, I'm done hiring. And all of a
sudden, you get layoffs and those type of things occur. So we're seeing something that says something vastly different relative to what the BLS is
reporting.
Exactly. And if I can just just let me read this real quick. I won't read the whole list here. But this is a list of recent layoffs. Twitch laid off 35% of
its workforce, Hasbro 20% of its workforce, Spotify 17% of its workforce, Levi's 15% of its workforce, Xerox 15%, Qualtrics 14%, Wayfair 13%,
Duolingo 10%, Washington Post 10%, eBay 9%, Business Insider 8%, PayPal 7%, Charles Schwab 6%. And then UPS, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pixar have all also
let thousands to 10s of thousands of employees go. My point here being is, again, this is the data we're seeing when we're looking at the window. These
are the storm clouds, this is the rain and the lightning we're seeing. And yet, you know, the BLS is saying, hey, nothing but sunny skies, right? If this
happened once fine, but we've seen this a lot. And we're now getting to a point where I think the disconnect and you showed that chart between the
establishment and the household survey that it's at its greatest discrepancy so far. I think it's getting really hard to look at this as anything other
than this is just as much lipstick as you can smear on that pig in an election year.
Yeah, mate, you know, there's a lot of comments about that, you know, about this is, you know, just manipulation and
We'll prove it wrong. What's the contrary?
Well, no, I'm not saying it's not. I'm just saying that, you know, the BLS is always wrong. I mean, it's, you know, I think it's more heightened. I
think people notice it more when it's
But they're a lot wronger. Yes, they're wrong, but they are a lot longer than normally right now.
Yeah, but the thing is, is they're always wrong. And, you know, then we don't find out how wrong they are until there's an actual revision to the
data later, but we don't care about revisions. Nobody ever goes back and looks at, you know, every year and every three years, we get these big data
revisions like on GDP, things like that. Nobody ever goes back and looks at those, you know, how wrong they were for so long. And we based all of our
monetary policy decisions, our fiscal policy decisions on this data that was flawed from the beginning. And, you know, so, you know, is it really
manipulating it, put the stick on the, you know, lipstick on the pig for the election? Maybe. I mean, they are a government agency, but I think it is a
function that their, you know, their collection, their data collection process is hugely flawed. Their mathematical adjustments are hugely flawed.
Their birth death adjustment is a complete farce. So, you know, because none of that has anything to do with what really happens, you know, in the world.
And if the BLS wanted to be honest, I run this analysis, is that if they wanted to really be honest, use the non seasonally adjusted household survey, and just
use a 12 month moving average, and you get a much more accurate employment rate over time than you do with all this other nonsense that they pay hundreds of
government employees to do. It would be one guy with a pencil, and he could do the whole job of the entire BLS.
Well, yeah, so, you know, simple solution never going to happen because it's simple and easy and smart, right? All right. So, well, the last point on this
was just because one of the reasons, folks, why this is so important is because many of the analysts I've interviewed on this channel, and I myself also
strongly share this opinion, which is that, like, one of the key linchpins in the whole story here is employment, right? That's really as goes employment,
will go, you know, the soft, hard, no landing scenario, right? And if you look at what's being reported right now by the BLS, it's like total no landing,
nothing to worry about, right? But if those indicators are faulty, one, you know, then the headlines are deceptive. But two, if that's what's driving
monetary policy, right, or monetary and fiscal policy, then that is akin to a pilot, you know, piloting a craft with faulty instrumentation. We've used that
analogy many times in the past and lens. Yes, we all agree that the BLS instruments aren't good in general, but there's a big difference if your altimeter is off by
a couple hundred feet versus many thousands of feet, right? And it's beginning to feel like it's the latter.
Yeah, but okay, but here's the important, it's a great point, right? And I'm not, I'm not saying you're wrong. But the market doesn't care about that.
Right? So and this is the important thing. Look, the markets are surging higher on Friday, on this employment number. Now that employment number is actually bad
for, let me show you something real quick, because you know, this is this is what's going on in the market. So let me just pull up a heat map of the
As you're pulling it up, let me ask this question for you to respond to. I think it's where you're going there, right? Which is like,
I don't think so. But go ahead.
Okay, no, no, no. All right. Well, then you go.
No, I was just gonna say, look, if you don't look at the markets today, the markets are up strongly on Friday. But it's only a handful of stocks. It's
Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft, it's all the big mega caps.
It's Groundhog Day.
So the point is, is that super strong employment number says that the Fed is not going to hike rates anytime soon. And the market completely shrugged
that off and said, yeah, you're still going to cut rates. Maybe it'll be maybe it'll be April or May, but I still think you're going to cut rates. And
so immediately, we go right back into the chase. Here's my point about this. So let's just say, let's just say you're absolutely right, Adam, and
that the economic the employment data is entirely wrong. I mean, and I'm not let's say it's wrong by 50%. And we only had a, you know, let's
say it's even worse that we actually had no employment last month, we just we had negative job growth, okay? It doesn't matter, because all
the math, all the market is going to look at today is what was that number? What's the implication of that number? Now, when we get the
revisions, you may very well be right, six months from now, or a year from now, we'll get the revisions that Oh, yeah, look at that, Adam was
right in January, we had negative job growth. But the market's going to be 30% higher, right? It'll be too late to matter. It'll be
and the market will have already factored in the fact that the employment data is changed. So you know, it's I'm not saying that it's not, don't
don't misunderstand what I'm saying, Adam, and anybody listen, don't don't take me what I'm saying is wrong, because I do all this same
data, right? I've you saw the charts, I was building charts this morning to analyze the the employment data. This stuff is important. But just
understand that the markets can remain irrational for a lot longer than you think. And they're in the markets are focusing on the data that
they have today. The market doesn't care about revisions, by the time that data gets revised, we'll be off onto a whole nother story that
we're looking at. Well, you know, yeah, job growth was a lot weaker than we thought. But look, we're over that hump. And now it's the new
horizon, employment should be coming back, you know, we got through the trough or whatever it was, the markets are always looking forward. So
you know, if you're if you're hinging, here's my whole point is that if you're hinging your entire portfolio analysis structure on valuations,
which are important valuations are very important. I did a whole segment on valuations in my presentation on Saturday. Valuations are very
important in the long term, in the long run. Yeah, they're not important this month, next month, this year, valuations are not important. It's
all about momentum. Economic data is not important unless it's something totally shocking. Like what would have actually shocked the markets
this morning, maybe good, maybe bad, was maybe that number being a negative 150,000 jobs and all of a sudden the market had to start
crying. Well, I guess we're gonna get rate cuts, but are we about to have a recession? Right, right. Yeah. And what's that going to do to
earnings? So you know, these are these are the challenges that we have as investors. And again, you know, this isn't a healthy market. Nobody's
arguing that I did a whole series of charts about the bifurcation between S&P market cap weighted and equal weighted. You know, and we have
this big in this year's another good example, S&P 500 market cap is just crushing equal weighted stocks right now. So you know, if
you're, you know, we run our portfolios kind of on a blended basis. And so, you know, we're, you know, having, you know, where our
performance is tracking the S&P right now, because bonds have been doing great this year. But outside of that, we would be lagging because we
don't own just seven stocks, or six. And again, groundhog day again. Okay, so this is this is going to the question that I was going to work up
to in this discussion, but I'll pull it up now, which is so the Atlanta GDP, Atlanta Fed's GDP now tool just increased its expected Q1 GDP, up
to 4.2%. It'll be higher after today. Okay, so here's my question, right? So let's, let's, let's even say, let's say it goes higher, right? So
you have higher than 4.2% expected GDP growth, and you've got just blockbuster jobs, right? How can the Fed accelerate cuts into this
environment, right? It's like, hey, this is this is an economy that is doing great. Maybe we need to start talking about overheating if we're
looking at these official numbers, right? I mean, does that does that somehow, you know, is that in some way, make it harder for the Fed to
deliver on the three rate cuts this year? Because it's like, why?
Well, this is look, this has been my argument all along, which is, you know, this is nirvana, you know, if I was if I was the Federal Reserve
Chairman, right? And I've got 5% rate hikes, you know, Fed funds rate sitting on my books right now. And the economy is doing fine markets are
doing great. You know, employment is fantastic. Why would it cut rates, I would just leave them there. And then when the economy when that
higher rate, that lag effect of higher rates actually started to kick into the market, then I have some ammo in my my gun, so to speak, that I
can start cutting rates to, you know, kind of boost the economy a bit, right? Exactly. Try to stave off recession, at the same time, I would be
rapidly cutting QT I'd be doing, I would have doubled or tripled QT by now, really started reducing that balance sheet. Yeah, it might cause
some problems for some of the banks. But you know, you got to resolve your own issues. At some point, you got to grow up be big boys like
everybody else, but be working off that balance sheet. So I had that room at some point in the future to start monetizing debt that the
government's going to need to issue. So, you know, this is, but this is look, I have I have tons of flaws with government, I thought the
government when interest rates were zero, and the 10 year Treasury and 30 year Treasury were trading below 1%, why didn't you refinance all
the Social Security debt, right? You know, there's so many missed opportunities to, you know, kind of fix some of the financial system that
just, you know, went away because we were too worried about bailing out the banks or supporting people. No, the reason the Fed's going to
cut the reason the Fed's going to cut rates regardless of this data is because of what's going on with the regional banks, you just had the
bank in New York, you know, got hit on Thursday, Wednesday, Thursday, whatever it was, you know, there are the liquidity and the reverse
repo is running out very quickly. And this all comes down to the member banks of the Fed, and they're going to make sure that there's plenty of
liquidity there for those guys, and the Fed's going to have to start monetizing about 30% of the Treasury debt issuance. So again, they really
don't have a choice. So yeah, economic data is great, but yeah, they're still going to cut rates.
So you're putting your finger right on the heart of like my angst here, right? Which is like, it feels like we have, well, it feels like we have
this Potemkin system, right? And for those that aren't familiar with the reference, it was back during the Russian czar era where they
didn't want to disappoint the czar as to how bad things truly were. So when he was making this cross country travel, they had this crew
going ahead of him basically building these facades at every village you would go through that made it look like a really prosperous
village, and then his car pool would go by and they'd dismantle it and then they'd go rebuild it at the next one. So yeah, it's like everything is
awesome, right? Which the markets are taking that and saying, "Okay, great. This is our rationale to go higher here, right?" But kind of nobody
believes it, right? It's your point. You're like, "Hey, the Fed's actually running scared about a lot of these things, and it's going to cut for these
reasons." We just talked about the jobs market probably not being nearly as sanguine as they're selling us. So it just feels like, again, we're
just kind of collectively lying to ourselves. And as long as everybody truly believes in fairies, Tinkerbell will continue to live here. But that's
not -- that has a reckoning at some point, right?
But again, that reckoning -- absolutely. At some point, there's gonna be a price to pay. But this is the problem that I've told you about before is
that I have clients that come into my office now that have been out of the market since 2009 because they kept believing that at any moment, the face
was going to come off this market and all this money would get lost and they were going to be there. And it's 500% higher than it was. And they're
just finally feels like, "I got to get in. I've got to get ready for retirement." So that's the whole point about this is that right now, this is a
market-driven environment. You need to be long stocks. If you've got a really bearish bent to your portfolio, you've got to start changing that.
Now, eventually -- and look, use corrections. We're going to have a correction sometime in the next few months. Use that as corrections, start moving some
money back into stocks. But this is going to be the play for a while. And look, and when it begins to change, we're going to know, right? All indicators
will start ringing off bells. It'll say, "Hey, the trend is breaking." And yes, you're going to lose a little bit of money off the top. You'll be down
8%, 9%, 10% from the peak, but then you'll get out and you'll be able to avoid the 20%, 30%, 40% draft that comes after that.
Okay, so let's dig in that just a little bit. So totally agree. And that's why I made the whole speech about being eagles earlier, right? But I'm
sure many people have this worry, which is, "All right, Lance, and because you're a capital manager, how do you avoid the Chuck Prince
fate?" Which is, "Hey, you know what, in this business, when the music's playing, you got to keep dancing and the music's still playing, so we're
still on the dance floor." How do you have confidence that you as a capital manager can see the warning signs and get out with a flesh wound
versus an amputation?
Well, like I said, look, every week we go through the charts and the analysis. And there's a lot of great managers out there that have
avoided big downturns in the markets, right? They participated in the way up, and they missed a lot of the downturn. In 2008, our
portfolios were down about 8%. In 2020, our portfolios were down about 8% versus 35%. So when you start to see these turns, and I wrote
articles in February of 2020 saying, "Hey, we're taking money out of the market. We don't know what's coming, but we feel something's
coming." And we took exposure out of portfolios. So those things, you're going to see them. I mean, the markets are good at predicting
outcomes. I said this on the other day, I was doing a radio show the other morning, and this is what I was explaining. And it's the same
premise, which is, here's how you know the difference. Anything that you can think of right now. So Adam, give me your top five geopolitical
concerns, or three or two. Just give me a couple. What are the couple of big things that are keeping you up at night right now?
Yeah, I mean, I'll come up with something, but I know your point, which is whatever I can think of, the market's thought of and priced it.
Right. And that's right. So if you think it's Russia, Ukraine, if you think it's Israel, Hamas, if you think it's what happened in Iran over
the last week with the three soldiers, if you think it's any of that stuff, this is how you know. Go flip on CNBC. What's the market doing? Is the
market up or down? And if the market's up, that ain't it. That's not the thing, right? Here's how you'll know. When you wake up one
morning, and there's some event that occurs overnight, and you wake up in the morning and the market's down 3, 4, 5% in the morning, go sell
everything, because that's the thing that the market wasn't expecting. And that's the way markets work. So markets all are about
liquidity. And as long as there's buyers and sellers meeting demand, the market's going to just do what it's doing. At the moment that an
event occurs, and again, this is why it's always some expected, exogenous event that we're not aware of, it's something that all of a
sudden the market wasn't looking at. And it goes, "Oh, damn, I didn't expect that to happen. I've got to reprice now for this event. And
that means I've got to do this." And that's where you just get sellers en masse in the markets, and you have this big decline. And that's
going to last. If that occurs, that's going to last for days. So yeah, you're going to clip 3 or 4% right off the top, getting out. That's
just part of the deal. But you're going to miss whatever that downside draft is until the Fed steps in to start to bail it out. And that's
what happened exactly in 2020. We were going down a little bit, the pandemic was showing up. And we were down 5%, 6%, 7% from the
peak. And all of a sudden, that was when President Trump stepped in and said, "Yeah, we're going to shut down the economy." And then it
was 30% lower right after that. And then at 35% down, the Fed says, "Hey, guess what? We're here!" And 1.2 trillion in QE, buying
junk bonds, sending checks to households, and then the market started to recover. So I mean, that's what you're looking for. You're
looking for that event where you flip on CNBC and the markets are falling apart. That's your sign to get out.
All right. Well, I appreciate you answering that question. Because I said, I know a lot of people have that concern about, "Well, if I'm
in, how do I not get just thrown into the meat grinder?" The process you just described is another big reason why we so often recommend
that folks work with a good financial advisor, one that actually has that perspective, knows what to look for, can take action when
needed during those shock surprise movements to protect you on the downside. And to be honest, most people, when that happens, Lance, when
you flip on CNBC, and it's down or whatever, most people are at work. They don't have time to rush and figure out what to do.
Right. No, that's what I'm saying. Here's the mistake that people make. Yeah, so you're at work. You get home in the evening, the market's
down 5%. Load up your orders for the next morning and sell. Here's what people do that winds getting them up in a trap. Okay, wow, the
market was down 5%. So as soon as it bounces, I'm going to sell. And then the market's down 5% more the next day. Okay, well, as soon as it
bounces, I'm going to get out. As soon as this thing bounces a little bit, maybe get me back close to where I was, I'll get out. Now they're
down another 5%.
You start pleading with God. Yeah. Okay. Just typically go back to where it was. And I promise I'll sell. Yeah.
Exactly. Right. And so we all find religion and foxholes in the stock market. The point is, though, is that you don't worry about that.
When you come home from that, whenever you get home from work, and the market's down 5% a day, you just sell everything. Figure it out
later. If the market goes up the next day, who cares? Buy back in. See, that's the other part that people make the big mistake on is
that they sell, and then they never get back in. So you know, yeah, you can't worry about, you know, the big mistake that every
investor makes is they don't want to be wrong. We're all going to be wrong. I'll give you my number one big rock. I bought meta right
before earnings in October 2022.
Yeah, yeah, I remember this program here.
And the stock went down 20% the next day, we got stopped out. And then I got off doing other things. I never bought the stock back and now
stocks up 400% from the lows. Now we made money elsewhere. But you know, huge mistake on my part, we all make mistakes. But you
can't worry about being wrong. It's okay to be wrong. Just don't stay wrong. That's the thing, right. And so once you're wrong, just,
you know, reverse it and and get back into the game. And then next, the next opportunity comes along and just from there.
Well, so that's all totally true. I just think that Lance that the vast majority of people like real life, real people, they come home at the
end of the day, they flip on CBC, oh my god, the market was down 5%. And they're in shock. Right? And I think they're in shock for a good
while, days, weeks, like, I just don't know what I should be doing here. They might not even be in that bargaining point with guys. And
again, this is sort of why especially when things get really emotionally charged, because things are moving faster than most people
realize. Again, this is the discipline that a good financial advisor, you know, who's seen many of these before had a plan in place for
this is reacting smartly in real time, can be a huge benefit for most people who are just in that flooded state by emotion. So anyways, got to
move on here. So I asked the big question of, can the Fed cut here? I think I have an even bigger question for you, Lance. And then we'll move on
to your trades, and then we'll move on to our rent, which is, okay, so we've got this gargantuan deficit now, right? We're doing as a
percentage GDP, we're doing fiscal spending that we've only seen in times of real war. And I'm not talking about proxy wars that may be being
fought around the world right now, I'm talking like sending hundreds of thousands to millions of troops abroad, rejiggering our economy to
support the war material and all that stuff. Now that we have flipped the fiscal spigot to 11, we've dialed all the way up to 11. And it's now kind of
becoming business as usual. Can it ever go back? Or will that just be so politically unpopular now that nobody's going to be the one to say, hey, you
know what, we've been extra generous for a while, now we have to tighten our belts a little bit and take some austerity? Is there a politician that's
going to say that now? Or have we crossed the Rubicon where it is just eternal, maximal deficit spending?
Well, look, we've been slowly, we talked about before, the frog in the boiling water. So we talked about deficit spending, and deficit spending has
been on a growing trend ever since 1980, when Reagan took office. And prior to that, we didn't really run a deficit, we pretty much had no deficit
at the beginning of 1980. Because at that point, Ronald Reagan's having to fend off two recessions before him. He's trying to get an interest, Paul
Boker's trying to bring interest rates down from sky high levels. So they started doing some deficit spending. And then, which was right in line with
Keynesian economic theory, which was that during a recession, you do deficit spending until the economy gets back on track. Well, what politicians
heard was is, oh, you do government spending, what they didn't hear was the part that they didn't like, which was, after the recession is over, you go
back to a surplus. That's Keynesian theory. Well, we just never did that. So we've been slowly just ramping up deficits ever since 1980. Now we
have these periods where we go crazy with deficit spending, like during the financial crisis. In 2008, we had a big surge in deficit spending. Thank
you very much. During 2020, we had a big surge in deficit spending, and now we're starting to ramp up deficit spending again. And the only reason, by
the way, that the deficit reduced in 2021 and 2022 was because we didn't renew the fiscal stimulus that we did in 2020. So that was the only reason
deficit declined. And now the spending that we're doing, this ongoing spending that we're doing is now ramping up that deficit again. But if you just
draw a trend line, you can see where that trend of the deficit is going. So to your point, Adam, yeah, this is the new world we live in since 1980,
which is more deficits, the better, because what politicians figured out is that if I do deficit spending, then that creates economic growth and I get
reelected.
Yeah, I mean, look at this. This is the third highest year, third biggest deficit relative to the record set during COVID, where we shut the global
economy down. But now we have 4.2 plus percent GDP growth that we're expecting. We've got Goldilocks, jobs market, inflation's coming down. It's
perfection looking at the official data. And it's like, if we need this level of fiscal spending in perfection, what the hell?
Well, look, I mean, put it this way. In Q4 of this past year, the economy grew at 3.3%, according to the BEA. We spent $2.50 of debt to grow that 3.3%
growth in the economy. So it's taking more and more debt to create that economic growth. So if you don't have debt issuance, if you're not running a
deficit, you're not going to have economic growth, you're going to have negative economic growth without deficit spending. So the question you asked me
was, is this the new thing? Yeah, this is the new thing. We're not ever going back to running a surplus, because we can do that. And as Mike talked
about during his speech on Saturday, is that you can certainly get back to a surplus. And we can certainly get this economy back on track, but you're
gonna have to go through a depression first, and nobody wants to do that. Here's the other side of that as well, is that, you know, if you take a
look at the wealth of the top 1% versus the wealth of everybody else, it's crossed, and now on more net worth than the rest of the entire economy
combined. But this has been a function that's been going on, not forever. Because back in the 1970s, 1980s, there was actually a decent
equilibrium between the top 1% and everybody else. And they kind of just tracked each other wealth wise. But beginning in 2000, when when we
started doing monetary interventions, and stock buybacks have gone crazy, etc. It has been a big wealth extraction out of the middle class. So
we've just been drawing more and more wealth from the middle class and shifting it to the top 1%. And that's not going to change either, because
that's the way our market and our economy is driven right now. I mean, take a look at the stocks running today in the market. Meta, billions had a
huge surge in advertising revenue. Okay, think about that for a moment. If Meta is making billions of dollars in advertising revenue, that
means that more and more people are buying products off of Facebook, right, or Instagram, since they own Instagram, too. Same thing for
Amazon. And so same thing for Google. So yes, companies are advertising on these platforms to sell you product, which means it's the more of
these things that you click on, and the more things that you buy offline, and more stuff you get sucked into on social media, you're sending
them your money, right? So it's extracting your wealth, and it's transferring it to these companies. So you keep living poor, and they keep
making more money, but that's the society that we're in today.
Well, in the 10% of households that own 93% of stocks, they're getting even richer as the share prices of those stocks go up because of that
dynamic.
Exactly. But again, that's the whole part about and look, the bottom 80% don't own stocks. So that's just more wealth that gets extracted from the
middle class. And then this is the article from last week on the website, why, despite booming economic data, Joe Biden's got the lowest
opinion polls, popularity ratings of any president, and you've got this perfect economy. And you've got really bad poll ratings. That's
because the average American isn't buying into it because they're not participating in it.
Yeah. In fact, they're suffering. In many cases, they're retrograding. So I talked about this a bit with Sven. And he raised a really good
point, which is, he's like, look, the problem is that this is the system now. So you just said that it's going to be continued mega deficit
spending going forward, and the Fed's going to have to monetize all this stuff. And as a output of all that, this wealth gap is going to continue
to accelerate. And so the question is, well, why don't we just see that that's a bad thing? And why don't we try to get under control? And to your
point about how, if we removed that, then we would have negative economic growth. We have a recession, maybe some folks might even want to argue
with depression. And so it's this hostage situation now. It's like, oh, you don't like it? Well, look, then we're going to have to shoot everybody in
America economically in the head, because we're going to have this massive recession or depression. Who wants that? And nobody wants to raise their
hand and say, oh, yes, please, let's have a depression. But until there's some sort of big correction in the system like that, it's just going to continue in
the direction that you were talking about, where more and more of the wealth and advantage and opportunity concentrates in the pockets of fewer and fewer
households going forward. And what worries me about that is the systemic break is almost the better choice at this point in time, because the other
trajectory ends in American oligarchy, but also probably in some sort of real social breakage, where the armies of the dispossessed finally get to a
breaking point where they just say, this isn't working for us anymore. Now, is that 10 years in the future, 100 years in the future? I don't know. But that's
basically a civil breaking and uprising after we basically destroyed the opportunity for all premise that this country was founded on. So I don't know,
when you asked me earlier, the things that keep me up at night, it's actually less the geopolitical stuff, and it's more the socio economic stuff.
Right. Look, it's plenty of evidence around the country. It's very interesting that social media, as an example, is not making our world any better.
And it sounds great. It connects people. I was listening to Mark Zuckerberg in front of Congress testifying.
Yeah, I did want to note that Congress did finally pull the social media companies and kind of "held them to account." That was a lot of political
grandstanding by a lot of the guys there. But yeah, go ahead.
Yeah, it's funny that they never do anything about it. But they were asking about, have you fixed the problem of the stuff you're showing to young
children? That's a super simple fix. You can't drive a car until you're 16. You can't enlist in the military until you're 18. You can't buy alcohol
until you're 21. Put an age limit on social media. If you don't want your kids having access to suicide data and all this other type of stuff,
put an age limit, right? You can't get on social media until you're an adult and you can figure out what's going on with it. I mean, so there's some
super simple fixes. But you look at the world, you look at depression rates, you look at suicide rates, you look at wealth disparity rates, all those
type of things. And there's almost an exact correlation back to 2010 when Facebook first went public. And ever since then, it's got, as social media
has progressed since 2010, things have gotten markedly worse in society. We have more division, more anger, more people are upset. We have racism
come back now. We got rid of that for decades. Now it's back. And it all stems from social media. So there's nothing good coming out of social media.
But yet we're driving our whole lives around it. And now we've got a whole market that's driven around nothing but that.
So I agree wholeheartedly just about everything you said, I am going to say a little bit later, something that's actually good that's coming out of some of
these social media platforms, because that's what we're talking to people through, right? But I totally agree. As folks know, my wife's a therapist, a
family therapist. And I mean, for the past 15 years, she has seen the rise of everything you're talking about, but at a very visceral level with the
families that she's worked with, and the kids who have been just toxically infected by all this stuff. She also has, I know, at least one client whose
role is to basically watch the horrible things that get posted on social media to determine, okay, do we need to take that down or not? And it's
terrible. I mean, it is terrible.
And there's the thing, right? What's your job? I watch horrible things get posted on social media to determine if they should take them down. If it
falls in the qualification of horrible, it comes down, period.
Yeah, but somebody has to watch it to determine it's horrible. They're like the infantry cannon fighter that has to watch the -- and no wonder they're in
therapy, because it's just headings. It's horrible things with children. It's just terrible. So yes, there's so much about this that's corrosive, and would
be a better society if we didn't have it, absolutely.
Yeah. Well, it's funny, I see all these videos and TikTok is like, how did you Gen Xers stay out of the culture? We didn't have social media. We were
outside playing with each other. And we had a disagreement with somebody, we punched them in the nose. That was the way it worked.
We had to invent our own fun. We had to manage through all of our interpersonal relationships. It's so funny.
Maybe if you went back to that, things would be better anyway.
Well, what's crazy is, I was just saying this yesterday, Gen X is kind of -- we're both Gen X, right? Gen X and Boomers, but Gen X are taken over
from Boomers now that Boomers are aging. We're kind of becoming the wise elders here to the Millennials and the Gen Z and saying, "Hey, back in our
day, we didn't have this stuff. And we had to figure this stuff out on our own." And Gen Z has the slacker generation knock against it. And being honest,
not for nothing. And the fact that now maybe the world is hinging upon the wisdom of Gen X, that's probably not the best place you want to be. That's
not a sign of excellence, right? World War One advising me like those guys knew how to do stuff, right?
And you're talking to a generation that was shooting bottle rockets at each other and throwing yard darts.
Exactly.
Yeah, you know, it's not necessarily the best generation to go to for wisdom.
It could be the guys that won World War One and World War Two and built America with their bare hands. Yeah, are the guys that can recite
Beavis and Butthead and have burn scars from bottle rockets.
Exactly.
All right, well, look, moving on. We'll revisit your retirement savings next week, Lance, just because we're beginning to get a little bit tight on
time here. Trades, what trades have you guys made over the past week, if any?
So we did a few trades this week. The vast majority was in the building out of the dividend equity model. So you know, like I was saying
earlier, we bought last week, we bought Meta, Apple, Google, because that dividend equity model is 30%, the MAG7, 70% dividend
yielding stocks. So you get the S&P performance with a higher dividend yield. So that's mostly what we did last week. Today, as I
mentioned early on in the show, we're lengthened the duration in our bond portfolio. We switched 5% of our short duration bonds one to
three year to seven to 10 year bonds. So that was kind of the big change. The equity model and the ETF model really haven't needed a lot of
changes. It's been performing well. It's a 60/40 model. And as of yesterday, the performance on a year day basis was just only slightly
below that of the S&P 500. So it's been tracking fairly well this year without performing our benchmark by a pretty hefty amount at the
moment. So again, we've kind of got the right mix so far this year. We'll see if that remains the case. But at this point, it's doing fine.
Okay, so perhaps the fundamentalists of you and you may not love this market, but the portfolio manager in you is enjoying it.
Yeah, I mean, you know, it's just like today, the, you know, the portfolio is doing okay. It's not doing as well as the market because
what's driving the market today are five stocks, basically six stocks. We own those stocks, but you look at the good fundamental
companies that actually grow earnings and have a good, you know, fundamental value. They're all negative today. So you know, that
really kind of tells you what's going on in the overall market. But, you know, again, it's just that's the market we're in. And, you
know, we have to be a little bit prudent about how much risk we take in a portfolio because again, we're, you know, as our article
today was talking about, about retirees taking on too much equity risk. There is a risk to that if something goes wrong, and you don't
have time to recover. So, you know, we always run a portfolio that's got some built in hedges to it theoretically. And that's kind of the
idea about the dividend equity growth model, which is that in an environment where money rotates out of these big mega seven, it
should rotate into these dividend yielding stocks that have lower volatility. So that portfolio theoretically, in theory, right, so
this is why it's in beta right now, we're going to run it for three months at Simplevisor. And then we'll, you know, we'll pull it out
for our clients to invest in, because there's a lot of demand for it. We got a lot of clients that want that I've had a lot of requests
for it. But I want to run it for about three months, but the volatility should be relatively less than the markets, but then we get
relative performance and a higher yield. So that's, that's the goal that we're going to try to get to.
Okay. All right. So I got two, two things I want to address in our rant. The first one is it's about media, we're seeing a pretty, pretty
big direction, some would even say wipe out across the media space right now. Let me just mention a couple of casualties recently. So this
week, the messenger was shut down. If you haven't, if you're not familiar with the messenger, don't feel bad. It was around for less than a
year. But it's kind of interesting, it was created to be kind of a new big thing in media and in this very partisan media landscape, this was
going to try to chart a more agnostic course, and they raised 50 million for it, and they burned through it all in a year. They shut down the
company unexpectedly. In fact, most of the employees found out about it through other media before they heard about it from their own company.
But in the last month, dozens of layoffs were announced at outlets including NBC News, Time Magazine, Business Insider, and the Los Angeles
Times. Sports Illustrated is shedding a significant reduction of its 100 member workforce. Staffers at Conde Nast walked off the job over the
company's plan to lay off staff, and the Wall Street Journal shook up its DC bureau with big layoffs. So we're seeing, and we've talked about this a
bit in the past, Lance, the traditional media model really suffering, and I think a big part of that is because eyeballs are leaving. People are
spending less time in these outlets, and the reason for that, which we've talked about in the past and relates to the financial mainstream media, is
that people are just not feeling well served anymore by it, and the number one complaint we get is by folks saying, "I've left CNBC," because CNBC
basically is an eternal market cheerleader. No matter what happens, it's always a good time to buy stocks, and that's largely because their big
advertisers are these big ETFs, and so they want to keep their advertisers happy. Also, CNBC is a good example of just wanting a soundbite. It's more
entertainment than it is actually actionable information, and so that's one of the reasons why people are coming online to sites like this one to get what I
consider to be or what I call more financially nutritious information, and so where I'm going with this, folks, is there is this sea change that's going on in
the media, and it is probably the principle reason why Thoughtful Money exists and has been doing fairly well so far is because, hopefully, we are
providing a better service than folks are getting elsewhere, and we have these long form discussions here so that we can really get into the meat of the
data. We try to keep it very focused on the information versus trying to just be entertainers, and fortunately, that seems to be working fairly well so
far, but what I want to point out here is that what gets supported in terms of one media versus another is the one that's supporting the viewers' needs,
and we try to do our best job of that here, but it's a two way street. There's only so much that I can anticipate or that I can glean by instinct or by
data, and it's really hearing from you all what's most important to you. What are we doing well? What do you want to see more of? Where are we falling
short? What improvements would you like to see? So this is basically just a big ask for me to say, first off, thank you all for your support and your
viewership and everything that's allowing Thoughtful Money to exist, but also, please keep the dialogue going. When you comment in the comment section,
I do read every single comment here on YouTube. When folks email us at Thoughtful Money, I read every email, and just for the record, the email address
there is support@thoughtfulmoney.com, so if you have something to say, I guarantee that I will listen to it. Can't always guarantee I'll act on it. We can't
meet everybody's wish, but certainly in the aggregate, we listen to what people are telling us, and then take action from that. Lance, just curious,
because you've been in the financial media industry for a long time. Anything to add to that?
Yeah, no. The legacy media like Wall Street Journal, etc., they really hurt themselves because they've become very partisan, so they only report one side
of the news, and there's been clear suppression of data that people aren't stupid, and that's one reason that we do all of our own research. People ask me,
"What do you watch?" I don't watch anything. I'm not on social media. I go on Twitter in the morning. I post charts.
Except TikTok, apparently. It sounds like you spend all your time on TikTok.
No, no, no. This is not people who send me. I get all kinds of emails from people, but I don't go on social media, especially during the day, but in the
morning, I'll post stuff on Twitter, and I don't return to it until the next morning, and then I post stuff, and I leave because all that distracts me
from the data, so everything that we do internally in terms of the news or the data, whatever it is, we're doing our own data crunching because we just find
the raw data, and we just punch the data, and during the COVID pandemic and during all that, there was just all kinds of false narratives being put out to the
media, and they were very easy to prove with the data, but nobody wanted to hear that, and people want to argue, and then they just want to present their
side, and they don't want to listen to their side, and we can't have conversations about anything, so that division is just driving more and more people
away. Speaking of the editor of the Wall Street Journal, she was at Davos, and she said straight up, "We don't control the narrative anymore, and we don't
control the news," and that's because that's their shortsightedness. Fox News is falling in this bucket.
They've lost the trust of their viewers, and they worked to do so. It wasn't a mistake.
They worked really hard at blowing the trust of consumers, and the other problem now is also, as we talked about this before, just about people being
feed-to-deck. Everybody's got a substack. Adams is worth it, but everybody's got a substack. Everybody's got a pay-for channel. Everybody's got a
pay-for newsletter, and people that are trying to make ends meet, every time they have a service, the service is raising a fee on them, and then
somebody else is, "Oh, if you want to read this article, you've got to pay $3 a month to read this article."
Yeah, they'll pay well. Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, and so now consumers are having to be much more conscious about where they get their data and where they're getting their information.
Individuals are becoming much more selective about where they're getting that information from, and the problem with a lot of these legacy
media is Business Insider is a great example of this. Very partisan, one-sided reporting from their site, and they're paying that price for that now
because people are going elsewhere where they can get better data, better information, and in a lot of cases, get it for free.
Well, let me be transparent about this, too. So one of the cornerstones of what we built here at Thoughtful Money is a content production platform
that provides the vast majority of the content and as high quality content as we can create to the world for free, and being super transparent about that,
folks, the way in which we fund that is, and I think that this is the right thing to do anyways, is we encourage people to work with a good professional
financial advisor who understands all the macro issues that we talk about here. As I say every week, if you've got a good one who's doing that for you,
great. Stick with them. They're really worth their weight in gold, but if you don't, feel free to have a free conversation with the financial advisors that you
see on this program with me every week. Lance, the guys at New Harbor, Jonathan Wellum from Canada. It's totally free. It will help you. You'll get good
information, good quality guidance. You can do with that guidance whatever you want. You can do a DIY strategy. You can give it to your existing advisor and
say, "Hey, I thought these guys were smart. Do this." Or if you like the advisors, you can talk with them about maybe working for them, and some percentage of
people do do that. That provides the revenue stream into this whole platform that allows us to offer everything up for free. So that's what we've tried to
create here is basically a virtuous system that benefits everybody but allows us to help as many people as possible by keeping a free product widely
distributed. I think more of the media should try to find models like that and not just kill people with fees or paywall content or everything else that you were
just talking about, Lance.
At the end of the day, the consumers are going to drive this. I was mentioning earlier that my wife and I are watching the Reacher series on Amazon. So we've
had Amazon Prime forever. We have one account that she and I share, and so that gives us access to Prime Video. And so the other day, she got back from her
trip, and we sat down to watch another episode of Reacher, and it says, "This video will now contain ads unless you want to pay another $2.95 a
month." And I kind of chuckled. I looked at my wife, and I go, "Honey, look at this." I said, "We're finally going back to the way it was when we
watched TV growing up," because TV was free, and you had commercials, and nobody cared, right? And so I think we're going to see a shift back towards
bundling of services. We were going to cut the cord, get rid of bundling, and that was going to be cheaper for everybody. Now it's gotten more expensive,
so I think we'll see a pushback towards bundling. I think we'll see a pushback towards free television that has ads. In other words, we're just going to go
full circle. But I think we'll see this with news content. I think, ultimately, I think these news outlets are going to figure it out that what consumers
want, by and large, is just fair, unbiased reporting. Tell me both sides of the story. Let me determine what I want to believe, but give me both
sides. If it's over the border crisis in Texas, give me both sides of that story. Let me determine what's good with that and what's bad with that. And I
think there will eventually be a pushback towards that, because we've gone to propaganda.news.
Yeah, no, I agree. And again, I think that's one of the reasons why channels like this are doing so well is people are starved for just impartial
information. Like, look, just give me the facts. Or if it's cloudy, let's have a debate and let's try to, let's have this be an exploration to try to
understand what the truth is, right, as opposed to, we've got two people with opposing sides, and they're just shouting each other, or we're trying to
cram, as you said, propaganda. Or you're suppressing data, or you're not giving the whole story. Right. But to your point, I think what consumers are
really hungry for, at the end of the day, is just value. I want quality content of whatever type of content I'm looking for, information,
entertainment, whatever, at a price that makes sense to me. And I fear, and you talked about the prime example of them saying, "Hey, we're going to
start shoving ads in this stuff unless you pay us," is there's this sort of business model that's emerging that it's like, it's suckification is sort of
how I think of it. Which is like, "Hey, we're going to make this suckier unless you want to pay us more." And I don't think that that serves consumers
well in the long run either. You might be right that we might kind of go back to the future on some of this stuff. But I was transparent about our
business model, because I think there are models out there that can be win-win-wins for everybody. But we're not pursuing them. Right. And more
people would if the consumer would do what they should, which is to vote with their dollars. And if you don't look, for instance, as an example,
then this will never happen. But let's say that you're opposed to Netflix raising their fee, again, because they're about to raise it again. And
then they're going to have a commercial, they're gonna have one lower fee that gives you commercials and then a higher fee.
That's the suckification model.
All right. So unsubscribe from Netflix. If everybody unsubscribed from Netflix, you know how fast their fee would come down? You know, so my
point is, is that the consumer has control over all of this. And, you know, we just have to make the conscious decision that we want something
better. And if you want something better and there's demand for it, guess what? Somebody is going to build it. And somebody would build a new
service, as an example, that would be, you know, a purveyor of truth, however you want to, you know, motto it. But there just has to be the
demand for it. And if that changes and there's this new opportunity that exists and people migrate towards that and leave these other kind of
legacy media sources in the dust, they're going to change because they want to stay in business, right? As consumers, we all forget that we have
power to change everything. We have the power to do it. We just have to be willing to sacrifice. And that's the key word, right? You've got to give
up something in order to make this change. But it'll get better if you do.
I so completely agree. And I got to move on to our last rant so we can wrap this up in time. But I totally agree. And again, that's sort of my whole
point, which is we're seeing that happen in legacy media right now, as people are basically voting with their feet, with their dollars. And we saw it
happen, and I'm not trying to get on whatever side of the issue, I'm just saying it was the consumer flexing their power. But we saw this with things
like the reaction to Bud Light and to Target last year, where the consumers basically said, "I don't agree with this. I'm taking my money elsewhere."
And to your point about social media, we could, as a society, forget about the government for a second, just as parents say, "You know what, we're just
going to say no social media for our kids until they're a certain age." Now, it's super hard. I'm not saying it's easy. I'm not even saying that that
necessarily is going to happen anytime soon. But it's possible. And we do have that agency as a populace to say, "Look, we're going to support the
change we want to see in the world." So anyways, totally agree with you. All right, getting to the second part of this rant. This isn't a rant, actually.
This is actually a really funny story. But I'm wrapping it in the context of this is what government problem solving looks like. And Lance, you have
ranted in the past that whenever government gets involved, whatever sector, whatever industry, it always makes things worse. We've seen that happen
in education, we've seen that happen in housing, we've seen that happen in just example after example. So this is a great story. I just stumbled across
this for the first time in forever. And I said I got to talk about this on the recap with Lance. Do you know who Dave Barry is?
Yeah, it's a guy that wrote Gilbert?
No, that's Scott Adams. Dave Barry is a humorist. He's written columns for the Miami Daily Herald for decades, but super funny comedian. And I actually
saw him present once and he told this story and it is 100% true and you can find it online and I will include a link to it in the description below this
video. So this is how the government took care of a problem back in the 70s. So in 1970, in Florence, Oregon, a 45 foot, eight ton sperm whale carcass
washed ashore on the beach. And I guess the beaches in Oregon are under the authority of the Oregon Highway Division. So they had the responsibility of
figuring out what to do with this massive rotting whale carcass. So they get a bunch of guys from the transportation division there and they're looking
around and these guys are used to building highways and so they're used to just kind of blowing things up, they get in their way. So they decide, "You know
what, let's get some dynamite. Let's blow this whale carcass into little pieces." And then all the ocean, the beach scavengers, the seagulls and the
crabs that are nibbling on it right now, they'll have these small pieces and they'll be able to eat them a lot faster and nature will take care of
things. So these guys are trying to figure out how much dynamite to pack onto this thing and keep packing and packing. And of course, the news crews have
been following this now for days and everybody's super excited. So a big day comes where they're going to blow up the whale and so they get the media to
move back like, I don't know, a mile or so from the carcass and everybody's watching and they push the plunger and boom, massive explosion. Whale just
vaporized, basically. And everybody's looking and they're like, "All right. Hey, these guys did their job. They blew up the whale." And then all of a
sudden, you start hearing the loud thumps of just massive chunks of blubber and whale parts descending all over the media and the crowd that's gathered.
They blew this thing so big that a mile away, there's just whale galore. It's falling on cars. It's staving in the cars. Actually, the guy who was in
charge of determining how much dynamite to use, his car got destroyed and he had just bought it at one of the local car dealerships that was offering a
promo called "Get a whale of a deal on a car because of the whole thing." And those little scavengers that they were expecting were going to eat the whale
vaporized. They just blew every seagull and crab to kingdom come in a half mile radius of this whale. And of course, basically, they blew the center of the
whale up. So there's still massive parts of the whale still there on the beach. So they didn't really even solve the core problem itself. But they just
created this massive chaos and destruction in this radius around the whole whale. So basically, that's just government. When it's got a solution, nine times
out of 10, that solution is just as bad, if not worse than the problem it started out to solve.
Yeah, that's right. And I'm actually writing an article for next Friday because you and I have spent a lot of time talking about housing unaffordability.
And so Elizabeth Warren and three Democrats now have a solution to make housing affordability better, which is to cut interest rates, which is exactly the
opposite of what you want to do. So I've got a really good article on housing coming out next Friday that we can talk about.
Yeah, just classic. And who knows if that passes. If it does, we'll talk a lot about it here. I just want to share one of my favorite demotivational
posters they have here. For folks that are listening on the podcast, it says, "Government, if you think the problems we create are bad, just wait until
you see our solutions." So anyways, guys, that Dave Barry story, way funnier if you hear Dave Barry describe it. I'm sure you can find a description
or he's talking about it on the internet, but I will actually post the link to the actual news footage of the whale getting exploded and then the huge
chunks of whale carcass falling down on the audience in the description of this video. It's a 100% true story. Alright, as we wrap up here, Lance, I did just want
to give you a chance to say anything you like about any takeaways that you took away from the Houston event. Like I said, I just had such a great time
there in general. Still full from the meal you took me to afterwards, still paying for that one, but all the folks that came up to me, so helpful, so generous,
so wonderful to meet them all in the flesh. I hardly ever get out of my little man cave studio here, so it was such a great experience for me. And Greg,
Valier, is that how you say his last name? Valier, yeah. Yeah, really smart guy. I'll probably have him on this program at some point in time to talk about
the intersection of how politics impacts the economy, but what I took away from him was that government is basically the cluster show that we all
suspect it to be and that the real problem, the root of the problem in all this is money in politics. It's all the massive special interest money that is just
basically infected its way into the political system and I did get a depressing sense from him that that's what drives the action there and it doesn't seem to be
any way to untangle that that he can see easily. No, and I've talked about this before, which is corporations drive bills, the lobby groups drive political
decisions and governments shouldn't be involved in politics. I mean, the corporations shouldn't be involved in politics at all, but they vote basically with their
dollars and they drive a lot of this. I mean, I'm still baffled how George Soros, who contributes to a lot of political outcomes in the United States and he doesn't even live
in the United States. So we've got to figure out as citizens at some point that if we want free, fair elections, we've got to get, and we want government to actually represent
our needs and our goals and the things that we want, we've got to get corporations out of it. And this is the part of the problem with the housing market, right? We have
massive corporations involved in housing. That just makes things worse for everybody. So yeah, it's unfortunate, but there's not a way to correct that because the people in
charge of changing those bills are the ones that benefit from those corporations being involved through political campaigns, super PACs, et cetera. So they're
certainly not going to vote for getting rid of corporate money in politics because that's what supports them. It's just like asking a congressman to vote for term limits.
Why would I do that? So these are the problems that we have with government. And look, our founding fathers never envisioned corporations being involved in the system.
That's why it's not addressed in the Constitution. They would not be for this. This was exactly the stuff that goes on today is exactly the stuff that they were
trying to leave and get rid of when they fled England and came here to establish a new country. And unfortunately, we're going right back to those very things
that they were trying to get away from through a lot of the decisions that we make. It's unfortunate, but there's nothing that I can see on the horizon that will change that.
That's interesting. Head corporations been around back in the 1700s. I wonder if it wouldn't just have been a separation of church and state, but it would have been a
separation of church, state businesses, business interests and state. Alright, well, look, folks, I'm wrapping it up here. Lance, as usual, I'm going to give you the last word in just a minute here.
But I just want to give folks a peek on what's coming up this week in terms of interviews. We've got Sven Henrich tomorrow, then we've got Axel Merck, then we've got Michael Green, and then we've got Grant Williams.
