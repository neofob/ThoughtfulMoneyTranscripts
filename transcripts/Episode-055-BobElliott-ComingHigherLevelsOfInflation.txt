Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm
its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. After decades of moving towards increased globalization,
the aftermath of the supply chain vulnerabilities revealed by the COVID pandemic, as well as the
geopolitical fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, they're pushing the world order into a
more fragmented state. If trade globalization has indeed peaked, what does that mean for the future
of the major world economies and for asset prices? To address, we're fortunate to be joined today by
Bob Elliott, former investment committee member at Bridgewater Associates and now CEO and CIO of the
investment company Unlimited. Bob, thanks so much for joining us today. Thanks for having me. Looking
forward to it. Hey, it's a real pleasure. Well, look, lots of talk about -- I've seen some of your recent
comments about post-peak globalization and really wanted to dig in that topic with you. Looking
forward to doing that today. Before we get to that specific topic, I just want to kick this off with
the usual question I asked my guests. What's your current assessment of the global economy and
financial markets? So in general, we're experiencing a pretty different macroeconomic cycle than most
people have experienced over the course of their lifetime. Whereas we've had a number of sort of
bubble bust cycles and with them V-shaped recoveries, this cycle is a lot different because
unlike the previous ones fueled by asset prices or by credit, the cycle that's going on today is an
income-oriented cycle. It's driven by nominal wage growth, which is strong enough to support nominal
spending growth, which is then driving continued expansion in the economy. And that sort of nominal
income growth-driven cycle can be very persistent. There aren't a lot of unsustainable flows related
to it the way that there typically is in a big credit boom or in a big asset price boom. And so
the result has been that the cycle, particularly in the United States, has been longer and stronger
than many people had expected. And as a function of that, what we've seen over and over again over
the course of the last couple of years is that asset markets sort of keep pricing in an expectation
of a swift shift to easing and economic weakness, particularly in the short rate and the bond
markets. But what has functionally occurred is the economy today basically looks about as strong as
it has over the course of the last couple of years. And that continuously surprises to the upside
relative to how folks are trading in the market. That story is particularly true in the US where
growth is the strongest and some of the inflation pressures are the highest. But it's also true in
many other developed economies where we haven't quite gotten the significant deceleration which
many folks had expected. And central banks also keep disappointing in other areas like
the UK or Europe in terms of the pace in which they'll deliver the types of easing that is
expected. Okay, so a question about that. So we've had, relatively recently, what, three of the top
five global economies slip into a technical recession. So can you balance that strength
with the fact that we're seeing slowdowns in those countries? And to be specific, I think it's what
Germany, UK, and Japan are now all in technical recessions, right? Well, I think when you think
about is a country in a recession or not, whether real GDP growth is positive or negative doesn't
matter. When you're thinking about an economy, what you want to think about is how are economic
conditions expanding relative to the underlying potential of the economy? And so if you look at
an economy like Europe, the potential growth of the European economy is already zero. It's
essentially zero or maybe even a little weaker. Productivity growth has been zero for many years.
The labor force there is contracting. And so zero growth in Europe is actually a totally fine
outcome given their overall demographics. And as a simple example, if you go look at the
unemployment rate in Europe, it is actually at secular lows. So while talking about recession
in Europe makes a lot of headlines, it's not a particularly relevant thing to be thinking about
or focusing on because the economy is growing about as well as it can given the underlying
potential of it. And the same is basically true in the UK. Japan's a little softer and is a bit
of an outlier across the developed world. But the basic picture that you have these economies that
are mostly fine against expectations that we're going to have a sharp deceleration,
that's the basic picture. And Europe and the UK, they've been growing basically at zero for two
years. Okay. And so you're saying this time, it's less asset price and credit expansion driven,
and it's more nominal wage growth driven. I just had a sheet that had all these stats on it that
I just literally tossed in the basket right before we sat down here. I wish I had held onto it.
Wages have been growing nominally in the US. I know less well other countries right now.
But they haven't been for all that long. This has been sort of a response to the
huge spike we saw in inflation. And the return to positive nominal growth in wages, if I'm
remembering correctly, came after like, I don't know, I want to say like 25 or more consecutive
months of negative, certainly negative real wage growth. And I'm not sure if there was much
positive nominal wage growth in that time period as well. You can correct me if you know better.
But if you ask people since inflation wave hit, I think it's something like 67% of respondents say,
my wages have not kept up with the pace of inflation. So I guess my question is,
how do we sort of square that where we had wages really at a disadvantage? Yeah, now they're
beginning to recover a bit. But again, since inflation is coming down, and we're starting
to see things like quits come down, and most of the most of the job growth is in part time jobs,
which doesn't come with a lot of benefits and stuff otherwise. How short lived might this
spike in real nominal wage growth that we've seen? How sustainable is this, I guess is what
I'm saying? Well, I think it's the improvement in real wage growth that we've seen over the
course of the last year or two is very sustainable. And that's the beautiful thing about wage growth,
which is one person's spending is another person's income, which then turns into another person's
spending. And it doesn't have the trail of liabilities that exists with credit. And it
doesn't have the balance sheet risks that exist with an asset bubble typically fueled by borrowing
in order to inflate an asset bubble. And so nominal wage growth in the US has been quite strong.
It peaked at 6%, 7%, 8%, depending on how you want to measure it. For instance, the Atlanta Fed
wage tracker peaked in that level. Like any inflationary cycle, the initial response
to the rise in prices was a lag until you got the point where wages started to outpace
inflation. But part of what happened there was the fiscal expansion and the transfer payments allowed
people to de-save for a period of time in order to keep their spending going during the period
in which the wages adjusted. And at this point, wages have grown over the course of the last
couple of years, roughly in line with prices, and now are starting to outpace price growth as wage
growth remains kind of sticky at sort of 4% or 5%, depending on how you measure it. And price growth
is kind of at 3%, let's say. And that's a pretty good scenario overall for households to continue
their spending. The main question is, what's the effect on companies? Because by its nature,
the fact that real wage growth is positive, the flip side of that, of course, is that company
profitability takes a drag. And so that's kind of the trade-off as long as nominal GDP continues to
grow at a fine pace, which it is at this point. The top line will matter more for those companies
than the margins in terms of generating continued profitability. But that's really the tension point
now. The tension points to the businesses, not to the households. Households haven't been in this
good of shape in a long time. Okay. And I'm sorry, I keep pulling into questions that I wanted to get
in after we went into the peak globalization part of the discussion, but you keep getting these
really relevant points. So help our viewers understand that because we have a lot of experts
on this program and they have all sorts of different opinions. I would say if I had to sort of
create a consensus, I would say that a lot of them are kind of concerned actually about consumer
households. And yes, it's good that wage growth has picked up and that is helping. Like I said,
though, a lot of households still feel like it's got a ways to go before they really feel like
they've healed from this cost of living shock that they took on. But we've seen things like
tremendous growth in, or let's say, rapid growth in household debt, especially revolving credit
that's happening at a time where that credit is charging record rates. We're seeing an explosion
of participation in payment schemes like buy now pay later and whatnot. A lot of people take these
signs as signs that the consumer household is increasingly starting to struggle. And we just
saw the retail sales numbers for January just came out. And I think it was the biggest year
over year decline that we've seen in retail sales since the early part of 2020 when we were shutting
down the global economy. That's just one month. That's not necessarily a trend yet. But people
can certainly look at some of these data points and say, "I don't know. It seems to me like the
consumer is really beginning to get weak." And when you look at consumer sentiment, yeah, it's
improving, but it's improving off of pretty low levels. When you say the consumer household is
strong, what particular metrics are you looking at? Well, I think it's important in this sort of
circumstance to make sure that you're looking at a holistic picture of what's going on rather
than trying to pick particular pieces of information. There's always, in any macroeconomic
environment, there's always a lot of cross-cutting information. In the past, if you go over the past
20 years, it's been valuable to try and pick out the things that look like they're leading
because there is that self-reinforcing dynamic. But in an environment where the post-COVID
environment has created a lot of noise across a lot of different things, plus an elevated
inflationary environment, means that you can get distracted by certain things when you're trying
to pick out pieces rather than look at the whole. Just responsive to the couple of things that you
brought up, consumer credit has risen as a percent of disposable income. It remains at roughly the
same levels as it was pre-COVID. Consumer credit, of course, has expanded in nominal terms because
consumer credit is predominantly revolving credit card debt. That credit card debt, the vast
majority in dollar terms, is paid off on a monthly basis by the borrowers on the credit cards. What
you're seeing is you're seeing nominal spending rising because inflation has risen, which means
that the debts on revolving credit inevitably have to rise because the overall level of spending and
charges on the accounts are rising. That's why you need to look at it relative to disposable income.
Secondly, if you look at buy now, pay later, a lot of people get focused on that. Just for context,
buy now, pay later, the amount of borrowing, the impact on GDP is equivalent to the GDP
of Saginaw. Saginaw, who cares about Saginaw? Probably 99% of the people watching this video
probably can't even pick out Saginaw on a map. I come from Detroit, so I know where Saginaw is.
That's what we're talking about. Who spends their time talking about Saginaw? But that is the
reality of what people are doing when they start to talk about buy now, pay later. That's how big
that is. It added 10ths, tiny basis points onto GDP because it is so small. But yet, people are
talking about it because it's a shiny thing that looks bad rather than quantifying it. That's why
it's so important. You have to quantify these points. It's not, oh, there's some stress in one
corner, some stress in another. Therefore, the whole system is going to come down.
What's going on with the vast majority of households? With secularly low unemployment,
their incomes are growing at 5% nominally. They have bought houses that they financed
between 2% and 3%. Those house prices up 40% and their stocks are surging, making their 401(k)s as
good a shape as they've been in a long time. That's what's going on. The result is that these
households are spending their nominal incomes and creating real spending power. That's the aggregate
picture. That's the picture for the median household. If 65% of households own their own
home, 65% of households own stocks. If you own stocks and you own your home and you have a 2%
mortgage and you're one of the 97% of folks out there in the labor market that are employed
and your wages are growing at 5%, it hasn't been better than this in a long time.
Okay. All right. That's a great list of things to be looking at here. I've got maybe one or two
questions to dig into that stuff, but I don't want to detract us anymore from the main event.
So maybe we'll get back to some of this stuff in a moment, but it's very helpful context.
Don't let me put words in your mouth, but it sounds like you're pretty sanguine
about at least the US economy looking forward here for the rest of the couple of years?
Well, any humble macro person will recognize that the foresight is in, at least in a cyclical basis,
is in the three to six month range. What's going to happen nine months from now? You don't want
to get over your skis on that. A lot of things could change. So I think when we look at the
picture in particular to kick off the first half of the year, and that connects to whether the Fed
is going to cut, et cetera, it looks like the economy has a fair amount of momentum in place
to continue to expand in a way that shouldn't lead to too much in the way of needing significant
monetary policy easing. Looking a lot further beyond then just becomes more and more uncertain.
Okay. So let me put it this way. You feel pretty sanguine right now and until in such time as you
come back on this program and start to see things that worry me, you're feeling pretty good.
That's right. I'll send you an email when things are not looking good.
All right. Great. Okay. So to the main question here. So this question about peak globalization
and maybe is it already in our rear view mirror? I noticed this initially in a tweet that you put
out on Twitter or X or whatever it's called now. And maybe if you can just give a little backstory
to the data set that you were looking at there. We have had periods in the past where we've shifted
from a more globalized economy to a lesser one. And so it's not like this has never happened,
but certainly globalization has been a really big trend for most living people. I mean, most folks
watching this video, that's kind of all they've known has been increasing globalization. If that
trend is truly starting to plateau and perhaps start reversing, what implications is that going
to have? Well, let me pull up the chart if you'll bear with me. Because I think it's a good chart.
Can you see this? Yep.
I think this was great context over a 200-year timeframe. What have we experienced? Most of us
and what the chart is, is the amount of trade that has occurred as a percent of the global economy.
And so measured as total imports as a percent of GDP reflected by adding up all the countries
based upon their population. So take all the country's population, weight them, imports as
a percent of GDP. And what you see here is relative to history, we've got one of the biggest,
basically the most global trade we've ever had in the last 150 years, which is not that surprising.
In particular, since we've brought on over the course of the last 50 years, a huge number of
different economies into the global mix for Japan and Asia, and then China coming after that.
Basically everyone alive today only knows this post-war surge in global production integration
that you see starting in 1945 and basically rising until the financial crisis and really just after
all the way to COVID. And that's a really important dynamic because what it did is it
increased a lot of efficiency. It was downward pressure on prices. It was a significant pressure
on the middle class of particularly the expensive developed world in terms of their wages. And
basically just created a ton of efficiency in the economy. Maybe not today, but if you go back
five or 10 years, basically every good and almost every service was basically either built or done
in the most efficient place in the world where the productivity adjusted cost of that labor to get
that service or good done was the lowest possible cost everywhere. And getting to a peak in that
and then possibly reversing that creates a radically different dynamic than basically
anyone's experience. But it's not that unusual in sort of a global economy sort of sense to have
these sorts of ebbs and flows from the post-World War I through World War II environment. A lot of
isolationism, a big drop. You had the UK dynamic when the UK became the global leader. You had a
big expansion in global trade and as they trailed off that also faded. So it's not like these things
are certain. I think many of us sort of take for granted that trade globalization is the reality
forever and it's definitely not necessarily the case. Okay. World woke up after COVID and said,
"Alright, we had these hyper-efficient supply chains but the cost there is resiliency in case
a monkey wrench gets thrown into the gears." Boy, it probably makes sense for us both from
an economic security standpoint but in certain cases from a national security standpoint
to bring some of those home. So we've got a lot of money flowing into building infrastructure here
in the US to try to re-shore French or some of those supply chains. Then of course Russia
invaded Ukraine. America sort of weaponized its financial system against Russia. I'm not saying
whether that was the right or the wrong thing to do but it certainly sent a message to other
countries that like, "Well, maybe not America's bad side today but I could be tomorrow and I don't
want to be completely vulnerable to that." At the same time and we can debate what the reasons for
this is but I think you're seeing a rise of nationalism in a lot of places around the world.
Europe I think is a good example right now where we're just seeing more populist candidates getting
elected at the top of the political pyramid and so it seems like there's a lot of seeds being laid
for this rolling over of the chart that you just had there where we could see less and less trade
being percent globalization going forward. A, I guess first, do you believe that those
seeds I mentioned are ones that are going to actually create that future and if they do,
what does that look like? I mean you can maybe make some pretty easy bets like, "Okay, that's
probably going to have more secular inflation in it just because the cost structure is going
to be rising at least in the developed world as we do that." But what other knock-on effects would
you expect to see? Well, I think for a lot of folks the impact of this shift from essentially
optimized production across the world to parallel production across the world will in many ways very
clearly have that inflation effect. But what I'd emphasize is that the sort of medium term, short
to medium term effect of that is actually growth positive which is very interesting and it's
globally growth positive because essentially what we're going to do over the course of the next five
or ten years is in each one of these different economic blocks, create parallel infrastructure
production and services infrastructure that didn't previously exist. And so if you think about it,
the t-shirt manufacturing that once was basically in the US then went abroad to Southeast Asia now
gets replicated. Maybe it's not in the US or maybe it's in lower income areas of the US or in Mexico
or in the rest of Latin America, but that's just that building that infrastructure requires
investment. That investment is a positive impulse on overall demand which is actually in the short
term a bigger impact on the inflationary dynamics than actually the shift in the goods production
because what it does, the actual investment has a levered effect on economic activity and happens
today, not over the course of the whole productive capacity. In the US context in particular what
we're seeing is things like the CHIPS Act and infrastructure and stuff like that which are
directly responsive to this dynamic creating a lot of strength that would have otherwise not
occurred. So I think that's really the first stage and particularly important in the context
of these economies that have had an inflation problem recently and are already operating at
late cycle relatively tight environments.
Okay. So that's growth positive. Basically, it's a short term stimulus, right?
It's a big short term stimulus, which I think it's easy to skip over that fact that, "Oh,
this is inflationary and that's kind of it." It's like, no, the first thing is it's growth
stimulative. Then it's inflationary as production capacity shifts to essentially onshore or
close shore supply relative to offshore supply. Then the other thing we should talk about and
reflect on is it's beneficial. There's big winners and big losers on that, which is the folks who had
the countries and ecosystems that had their productive capacity hollowed out and the groups
in these economies that had been out competed by global supply of labor that came on from farm to
factory. Those folks are going to actually see a marginal benefit, whereas those who are so
reliant on the internationalization, and that is particularly China, but also India and other
places in South Asia that were very reliant on the plugging into the globalization pipeline,
those folks are going to see a real detriment to their ability to continue to see the type
of growth that they saw before. Okay. So, yes, I don't know exactly how much it,
but some material percentage of global commerce flow that was going into their coffers is not
going to go there anymore, and it's obviously going to impact them pretty strongly. Let's
talk about the states for a second. So, if I understand you correctly, I remember, when was
it '92? Was that Ross Perot and the giant sucking sound of jobs that we're going to hear because of
NAFTA? And then, of course, you're talking more on a global scale, where we sucked all these jobs,
largely sort of middle-class jobs off to other countries, production jobs, etc., because they
could be done, as you said, on a much cheaper basis there. How beneficial do you think this
could be to the middle class? Is this really good news for the American middle class? Because
the middle class has been getting pretty beaten up for a good while, and I think if you talk to
folks in the middle class right now, they almost kind of feel like an endangered species. Maybe I'm
using a little bit of hyperbole there, but that's how they feel. Is this something for them to really
cheer going forward? Is this going to make a material difference to the prospects of the
middle class in America? Well, I think for cohorts that have seen a significant decline
in their labor opportunities, the onshoring of productive capacity is a pretty important
positive for those areas. And I think, in particular, as you start to look at where
in the U.S. context, where are the most attractive opportunities to start to build
this infrastructure is in places that you're not going to build this infrastructure
within 100 miles of New York City because it's going to be too expensive.
Instead, you're going to build it in the fallow fields of forgotten Detroit or Cleveland
and Saginaw or Flint. That's right. We'll see how many Michigan references we can make in this
particular conversation. But I think for those areas, the people who have continued to engage in
manufacturing production, just very, very high skilled manufacturing production, are still around
in those areas. And so you have a lot of capability, a lot of expertise in terms of how
to set these things up, build them, et cetera. But what hasn't happened is it hasn't drawn in
the additional free labor in those areas that's much cheaper today than it was in the past.
And so I think that that can create, how is the U.S. going to significantly support incomes
of those who don't have college degrees. I think it's going to be through this infrastructure
process, first building the buildings and then staffing the buildings that are doing
the manufacturing capacity. And so that's going to be a real benefit for maybe not the middle class.
And I probably distinguish it because I think there's other things going on with the educated
middle class, the white collar worker. But for the blue collar worker, this may be one of the
better 10 or 20 years that has been in place relative to the last 50 years.
Okay. Well, that's something to cheer. How much, and I'm probably asking you to speculate
unfairly here. I just don't know and I'm curious. What do you think the national, the folks that are
deciding to do this right at the corporate boardrooms and maybe with the influence of folks in Washington.
How much do you think they're trying to reassure here? Is it like, "Hey, we're not going to
reassure everything because that's just not cost effective. We'll still work with these guys
internationally. We're just going to work with them not as much and we're going to have enough
critical capacity here so that if we have another global pandemic type thing, we're going to have
some domestic supply that we can scale up and we already have the infrastructure and the
knowledge and stuff on how to do that. It's a lot easier to go from 5% production to 15% or 20%
production than it is to go from zero production to anything. And so how much of it is sort of
like that where it's like a minority stake in the production ecosystem, but it's
one that you could scale up if you had to. Or is it more than that? Is it like, "Hey, we're
just going to keep trying to do this and turn the clock backwards and see how far we can go?"
Yeah, well, I think in some ways it's going to come down to what the policy framework is
that's going to exist for the U.S. and I think the U.S. in particular, but other
developed economies. If you just take for instance something like putting 60% tariffs on China,
which is a proposed policy, or at least they talked about policy from one of the presidential
candidates, that type of magnitude of tariff policy essentially totally changes the economics
of onshore versus offshore production or nearshore versus far offshore production.
If you go back to the chart I was showing before, we went from a period of time where something like
15% of GDP was in some sort of tradable structure in one form or another to about 30-35%. There's no
reason why we couldn't go back to 15%, let's say, something back to sort of the average pre-post
World War II in an isolationist environment. I'm not saying that necessarily that that's a
certainty that we're going to go there. I'm just saying if you're thinking about what this could
look like in a sort of, let's call it a maxi isolationist environment, you could get to
something that looks in that order of magnitude, particularly on a blocks perspective, so maybe not
USA in particular, but like U.S., Canada, Mexico is a block or Western Hemisphere is a block.
That would mean moving 15% of GDP essentially of global activity, basically duplicating something
like 15% of GDP of global activity in one form or another. If that happens over the course of 10 or
20 years, even 10 or 20 years would be a meaningful impact on economic conditions for the investor,
the people building the capacity, and would be a meaningful detriment in terms of no new capacity
build for the folks who are feeling the pain from the unwind of the globalization trends. That's a
dynamic that could be meaningfully supportive to a U.S. economy, and I should say it happens
in an environment where we're also having these demographic challenges, and so you have lower or
falling supply of labor need to reshore, need to build parallel infrastructure. That combination
of things is pretty challenging when it comes to thinking about how are we going to move and build
and plus the skill loss that's happened over the last 40 years in terms of literally doing it.
Putting that all together is a pretty challenging task if we're going to really decouple from each
other. Yeah, and let me continue my U.S.-centric line of questioning here because this conversation
comes just a few days after I had one with a demographer really getting into the challenges
that, I mean, it's rampant across much of the world now. I mean, really, except for Africa,
most countries are on track to basically start entering some form of population decline in the
next couple of decades, and they're all aging as well, so the key productive age cohort of
25 to 54 year olds is already shrinking in almost any country you and I can name except for Africa.
So it sounds like part of the recipe for success going forward for
countries is going to be who can attract and grow that cohort. If you can do it
internally, great, but if not, what's your supply of new people who are going to be
filling that need of younger productive workers? And I guess I want to sort of connect that to your
comment there about, I guess, trading blocks where we've seen a lot in the headlines over the
past couple years about the rise of the BRICs and a lot of postulation that the
unipolar world is now becoming at least bipolar and who knows, maybe they might create their own
competing currency and all that stuff. I don't want to get into that, but I guess
in your study of this so far, what do you think is the likelihood that we will fragment
into trading blocks where it'll be America -- I don't know who they are but I'm sure we'll still
keep a lot of our Atlantic alliances and maybe get even closer to Latin and South America because
that can be a source of younger workers for us and then have the rest of the world try to
rotate around what seems to be the emerging BRICs access? Well, I think the story's
probably a little different between the different major blocks when you look at
the U.S. The obvious place to turn, which has the combination of geographic
proximity, similar enough value structure and corporate structure and strong
pretty well-educated labor force growth is for the U.S. to really turn first to Mexico, which
of course we've done for 25 years, but then also turn to the rest of Latin America. I think
that's really, from the U.S. perspective, I can easily see a transition here from a NAFTA block
to a Western Hemisphere block being the primary economic engine, which is interesting because
a lot of the talk with the BRICs is like the intersection between, say, Brazil
and China. If anything, it seems like this shift to a less integrated world is more likely to
break that rather than support that relationship, given the geographic proximity as well as, and I
should emphasize, the capital flows dynamic as well. We've talked a lot about trade and
production and things like that. That is also another very important dynamic here because
when you go through a period where you're going to have to rebuild so much infrastructure,
the places that are going to be able to do that most effectively are the places
that have the deepest, most effective capital markets and access to capital.
The U.S. dollar is a huge liquid capital market with tons of skill in terms of allocating it,
particularly to emerging economies, whereas other groups like China have proven
certainly to struggle to some extent in doing that access to global or providing global capital in a
way that is at least economic in nature. They've been proven to be able to do it in a non-economic
way through Belt and Road, but not really in an economic way that over time is going to really
pay the dividends the way that the Western and particularly U.S. capital markets have
become very effective in. All right, so just kind of connecting the dots from what you're saying
here, I take it that there are definitely points of view out there that say, look, U.S. has had a
great ride, but it's got a lot of problems and its best days are behind it, and whether we want to
talk about its debt burden or the erosion of the middle class. There are whole litany
things we could go through to say, okay, this is the list of reasons to be concerned,
but with your broad brushstrokes, I'm sort of hearing a different story, which is,
hey, the next couple of years may actually be pretty good in the U.S. and a number of other
places because of this short-term stimulus from all the infrastructure spending and stuff like
that, but also when we look at kind of who's positioned well for a potentially post-peak
globalization world, the U.S. has got a lot of strengths going for it that a lot of other
countries on the chessboard and even a lot of other big ones on the chessboard and China, etc.,
don't have. So are you pretty sanguine about the opportunities for the U.S. economy from here?
Knowing there are going to be bumps along the road.
Yeah, I mean, I think my mind is, I'm reminded as a kid growing up in Detroit right around 1990,
we, you know, there's the question of which sort of languages were you going to learn in school,
in elementary school and middle school, and at the time we all had to learn Japanese because at the
time everyone had penciled out that the Japanese, particularly in the auto industry, were going to
take over the global auto industry and, you know, the U.S. was going to be beat and we needed to get
on board and be prepared for that situation. And what we saw over the course of, while I was
learning Japanese, the U.S. economy was having the single greatest period of 10 years of the last
hundred, and Japan had a terrible outcome because of a combination of demographic and debt-related
issues. And, you know, I don't want to extrapolate one place to another, but it certainly, all of the
tales of China taking over everything in the world and being the great superpower certainly reminded
me of the feeling in Detroit as a kid in 1990, learning Japanese, when I was hearing all of those
tales over the course of the last 10 years. And so, you know, these things don't, they seem
very obvious at the time that there's going to be one obvious winner and one obvious loser.
When, you know, I think what's happened, what's been proven by the U.S. over the course of the
last 75 or 100 years is, you know, a resilience to be able to reinvent and recreate and lead
over and over again, despite the challenges of a variety of different powers that have
threatened it. And so, yeah, I think there's a lot of stuff, there's a lot of things in place for the
U.S. to maybe not be the sole leader or the only leader the way it was sort of in the post-war
period, but to be, you know, the best amongst the opportunities that are out there over the
course of the next 10 or 20 years. Okay. So, thank you. This has been a super fascinating
discussion. And it's great to hear some of these fundamental reasons for long-term optimism, which
is great. Let's translate this now into what you do on a day-to-day basis, right, which is figure
out how to, you know, manage investor capital for the future you see ahead. And, you know, in
theory, at least the economy and the markets should be connected to one another, but they're
not the same thing. And I'm curious to get a sense for given kind of the macro outlook you've shared
with us, kind of what kind of investing strategy you've put together. But I also just
wanted to give a nod to the fact that, you know, you said this wasn't an asset price-driven
expansion, but, you know, asset prices are doing pretty well right now. Animal spirits are running
pretty high. We're back into margin expansion. We have a market that's got really narrow breadth
right now. And so one can make the argument that asset prices, you know, could be excessive,
at least relative to fundamentals in this current market. I wonder if you feel the same and how
that might be impacting your investing right now. Well, I think I'd probably separate two things.
A lot of what we talked about related to sort of the secular trend, the possible secular trend to
de-globalization is really the sort of thing to start to think about for your strategic portfolio
rather than tactical bets. Absolutely. That stuff's going to play out over decades.
Over going to play out over decades. I think the thing that's interesting about that
is that a lot of people in terms of their structural predisposition, in terms of where
they would typically allocate capital, it's been very oriented around, you know,
strong growth, low inflation, that's basic, which has been a great trade for the last 30 or 40 years
of global integration. And what we see here, you know, in a post-globalization or deteriorating
globalization world, which is likely to have, you know, higher inflation, higher pressure on
commodity prices, et cetera. I think that's a real interesting story from a strategic perspective
where the vast majority of investors are totally unprepared for that, right? They're basically
prepared for the next 40 years to be the same as the last 40 years. And it's very possible we see
a totally different environment where there's persistent pressure, upward pressure on inflation
and, you know, higher levels of risk in the economy than what people saw before. So from
a strategic perspective, it really draws you away from sort of traditional 60/40 to much more
balanced, particularly holding diversified commodities. I think also in that context,
the de-linking of, you know, global capital markets will likely cause those outside of the
dollar market in particular to look for other monetary assets. You know, I'm kind of an old
school macro guy, so my mind, of course, gets drawn quickly to gold and the demands basically
from non-US entities to hold gold as a way to hedge, you know, dollar exposures and that
withdrawal of capital. You know, people who are into the world of alternative money might also,
you know, argue and reasonably argue that maybe Bitcoin is a reasonable alternative as well and
might cause, you know, might be an area where, you know, folks who may not have access to dollars
might choose that as a currency to either save or transact. And I don't have a particularly strong
view on Bitcoin one way or the other, but, you know, I think there's some reasonable logic
related to that that would align with this more secular view. In a secular inflationary world,
investing in something that sort of holds its purchasing power as an inflation hedge
makes sense. That's right. And finding other money other than dollars if you're locked out
of the dollar system, either as a saver in a state level saver like a sovereign wealth fund
or central bank, or as an individual saver, you know, where, you know, having dollars stuffed in
your mattress if you're in Beijing may not be as effective in the next 20 years as it was, you know,
in the previous period. And so I think that's kind of an interesting, you know, basically an
interesting sort of strategic situation for many portfolios that are just not very well prepared.
You know, what happens if, you know, inflation is not at 2% or 1% for the next 20 years because of
all the dynamics we described? What if it's at 3 or 4%? That's a very different environment than
most people have saved in. So that's, you know, I think that's probably the most interesting
strategic story that's going on. Great. Sorry to interrupt, but just to maybe add so you can riff
on this. But a higher inflationary world generally means a higher interest rate world, correct? I
mean, interest rates are basically a function of inflation and inflation expectations. So higher
cost of capital. I just want to put that into the mix because you said it may be a very different
next 40 years than we've been used to for the past 40. And the past 40 was disinflationary and just,
you know, an escalator down in bond yields. So that could be a very different world going forward.
That's right. I mean, I think whether or not inflation remains elevated or ends up being
elevated meaningfully relative to what we experienced is really a choice by the central bank.
The question is not whether or not there will be inflation pressures as this plays out. There will
be inflation pressures that will emerge as a function of this. The question is, you know,
how much inflation is going to be taken versus how much is the Fed and the central bank going to,
and other central banks going to basically keep a lid on that inflation by keeping interest rates
high and suppressing demand in that context. And so you don't know which one it'll be,
so you kind of want to be positioned for both of them. I think one of the key things that,
you know, it's a particularly large flip from the era of zero interest rates and unlimited
money supply that many businesses and investment strategies frankly have been built on. So if you're
a venture capitalist or private equity manager, like it has been a great 15 years, but it may
well be quite a challenging next 15, which we're just at the start of, if you're reliant on,
you know, zero interest rates and unlimited liquidity in an environment where we have,
you know, this amount of infrastructure rebuilding and elevated inflationary pressures.
Okay. All right. So those are sort of secular outlooks. And if I took decent notes,
you think sort of inflation hedges make sense to have in there, especially for
people in countries that are exposed to dollar risk. I guess one question on this,
folks like Jeremy Grantham, you know, highly respected investors, you know, he for a while,
and I think he still continues to say, hey, you know, lots of opportunity in emerging markets,
don't forget about those guys. And of course, price and value are two different things. But
my guess is you would say emerging markets are not going to perform as well as some might think
in the type of, should we go down this increasingly deteriorating globalization path?
Well, I think it matters a lot. There are no emerging markets. There are countries and there
are particular economic conditions. And so the path that we've described actually could be very,
very, very positive for a country like Brazil, right? With, you know, strong demographics and
geographic proximity and, you know, relatively well-managed actually macroeconomic conditions
and elevated interest rates that could come down. And, you know, that's a combination of things that
actually could be very positive for a country like that. Whereas the story for, say, Philippines or
Vietnam, which may be locked out, you know, may be forced to instead of being sort of a globally
integrated economy, be a China block integrated economy, it could be quite poor for them. So
matters a lot who we're talking about in that context.
Got it. Okay. So take a very active approach to it. And it really matters what team you're on and
what the prospects of that team have. Okay, great, great clarification. All right. So if we can bring
in our beam from years to decades out to 2024, and let's say at least the parts of 2024 and your
headlights feel comfortable talking about here, what are you looking at right now? Because the
vibe I got from you sort of earlier is pretty good in the near term, right? So is it sort of game on
for everything? Or are you worried at all about how far and how fast stocks have gone or any other
assets? Well, I think one of the fun things about being a macro investor is you can pick the trades
that you want to pick and not trade the things you don't want to pick. And that's an important thing.
You don't have to trade every market. You don't have to think about every market. You just want
to find the best opportunities. And so I think coming into the year, the best opportunity seemed
relatively clear that we were probably not going to have seven cuts that were priced in to the US.
And probably there was going to be pressure on bond yields to rise and for stocks to outperform
bonds. Now, the reality is in the last six weeks, pricing has changed a lot. Just before we got on
here, I was looking at it and now we have three cuts priced in for '24, not seven cuts priced in.
That's a heck of a move, particularly in eight weeks. That's a heck of a move to have seen
over that timeframe. And so now interest rate policy on the short end is reasonable. Maybe
there'll be less than three cuts because the economy is stronger and inflation is a little
higher. But you don't want to pick trades that are the difference between three cuts and two cuts.
Who cares? No one has that level of precision. The difference is between seven and three and two.
That's what you want to trade. And so right now, when I look across the overall financial markets,
you have a strong economy, you have elevated inflation pressures, you have a Fed that probably
is going to be a little more cautious than what many people had expected. And I should add,
and you have large fiscal supply that's coming into the market that's going to pick up by 50%
on a net issuance basis in the second quarter of the year. And so the real question is,
why are bonds... Can bonds continue to be priced in a way where there's essentially a zero term
premium on the long end of the bond market given that set of macroeconomic conditions?
It seems unlikely we're going to see that. And so yield curve steepening seems like one of the most
compelling dynamics right now. Right now we have an inverted yield curve and we still have an
inverted yield curve. And so seeing a shift to a steeper yield curve environment seems compelling
given what's happening with the macro economy and also what's happening with the overall flows
dynamics. So that's really what I'd center on. I just want to make sure the viewers are following
you here. So when you talk about a steepening of the yield curve, I believe you're talking about
the long end of the curve catching up to where short-term rates are right now versus the other
way around, right? Exactly, exactly. Which means that bond prices will come down, yields will go
up. That's exactly right, is that a lot of the tightening, I mean, essentially a lot of the
tightening that we've seen so far has been really the short end dragging up the long end, rather
than the long end reflecting the underlying strength in the economy, the inflationary
pressures in the bond supply. And so that's the sort of thing that can continue for a period of
time. But it's almost like each day the recession doesn't come, the long bond holders look at
themselves and say, ooh, this may not be the right trade here. I'm not sure I necessarily want to
hold this much duration. I might not want to hold as many bonds as I'm holding right now,
just as the supply of the bonds coming into the market is rising substantially. And so that really
looks like the best opportunity when I scan across the markets and look at all the different things.
Now, most people don't care about trading yield curves or short rates, they probably mostly care
about equities. And what I'd say there is we've gotten a heck of a run of stocks in particular
relative to their performance versus bonds. We've got a heck of a run on that. And the economy is
strong, but it's going to be tough to meet the level of expectations, particularly in
earnings that exist in the market, whether it's in the MAG-7, but also S&P 493 is expected to have
double digit, higher double digit, year-over-year earnings by the end of the fourth quarter.
That's going to be tough. It's not impossible, but it's going to be tough. And so
I think we're transitioning and you just even see it in the market. Those bond yields rising are
putting a feel of a bit of a lid on what's going on with stock price appreciation. And so
that dynamic, that interplay will probably add up to a more contained equity market environment
on a forward-looking basis than what we've seen over the course of the last three or four months.
It's been a heck of a ride in the last three or four months with any context. It's been one of
the best stock market three or four months that has ever existed outside of bounces at bottom. So
it would make sense to have a bit of a pause on a forward-looking basis, particularly if
we see a yield rise that comes with it. Okay. And I'm just curious, how are you playing that?
Are you actually beginning to sell here and lock in these gains? Are you just putting hedges in
in case there's a correction? Are you making big sector rotational shifts? How are you
dealing with that reality of, "Hey, we've had it. Great. We've had a nice surprise on the upside
here. What are we going to do about that going forward?" Well, I think that still the best trade
if you're going to hold equity risk is stocks versus bonds. And so the thing that I see on
that is cutting back the strength of that position, which has been a heck of a position in terms of
trading over the course of the last 12 weeks or something like that, and instead shifting.
If you agree that the US economy is likely to be in pretty good shape, then you're better off
betting it on yield curve steepening than you are on betting it on stocks outright or stocks
versus bonds, given where stocks are. If we get another couple of quarters of 3% GDP growth,
bond yields are going to move up a fair amount relative to short rates, and that'll be a pretty
good trade. So whenever you're trading markets, it's always a question of where is the best
disconnect between what's likely to transpire in the macro economy and what the markets are
pricing, and that's where the best disconnect exists today. All right, that's great. So Bob,
thank you so much for coming on here. I just have a couple of quick last questions for you. We'll
wrap it up here. But I do want to say I have a lot of people that come on this channel. We do
four interviews a week, so you can imagine we produce a fair amount of these discussions over
time. And I would say that you are more optimistic than the average, and people are always asking me,
"Hey, you should get more bulls on the program. Why do you interview all these bearish people?"
And I don't recruit people for bullishness or bearishness. I just recruit people who are data
driven in their framework and can have a data driven rationale for why they see what they see.
And for whatever reasons, the majority recently have been more on the pessimistic side. So it's
really nice to hear the other side of the argument and explained so clearly and well here. And then,
of course, viewers can pick and choose which argument they think, personally, is more
compelling. First off, would you call yourself bullish right now? Again, I don't want to put a
label on you if you feel like it's an unfair one. But I think relative to the people who've been on
this channel recently, I would describe you as such. Yeah, I wrote at the beginning of the year,
my view was, instead of this idea of higher for longer, my thought was stronger for longer. And so
you call me an economic bull. And then what that means for asset prices,
that means I'm a bond bear as a function of that. A macro guy doesn't think about bullish and
bearish as only one particular asset. You think about all the assets and bullish stocks versus
bonds, bearish bonds, bearish short rates, all of those things are all around the central idea that
the strength of the economy is not sufficiently reflected across asset markets at this point.
Okay, great. And I should have qualified. I would have been an economic bull, but yes. Okay, great.
An economic bull.
Great, great. Well, the door is open here to come back on anytime in the future you'd like to when
you're seeing anything positive or negatively on the horizon that is evolving the way that you
think. It's really nice to have people in both camps here that, again, aren't doing it from a
place of dogma. They're just doing it from a place of looking at the data and then making their case.
All right, so two last questions for you. First one, very important. For folks that have really
enjoyed this discussion and would like to follow you in your work, where should they go?
Yeah, I'm very active on Twitter or X or whatever the heck you call it these days. I still go to
twitter.com every time I write a tweet every morning. It's @bobbyunlimited. I'm very active
there just on the play-by-play of what's going on in the macro markets. And then if you
don't like to read tweets and like videos, I also have the last couple months started a YouTube
channel, also @bobbyunlimited, with clips from various appearances. And then for those of you
more into the finance industry dynamics, I use LinkedIn to talk a little bit more about some of
the dynamics that are going on in the asset management business as well, which you can
find me under my name. Awesome. Fantastic. And when I edit this, Bob, I'll put up the URLs to
those on the screen so folks know exactly where to go. Folks, we'll have them listed in the
description below the video, too, if you want one-click access to them. Okay, I'm going to ask you
the last question in just a second. I got a little bit of housekeeping to do beforehand, but just to
give you a heads up. It's that we've been talking about all sorts of macro market money related
topics here so far. What's one non-money related investment that you would encourage people to
consider adopting in their lives? And I'll give you 30 seconds to think about that while I just
do our housekeeping here. First off, folks, if you've really enjoyed having Bob on, we'd like to

Bob's given us a lot of great things here to think about. A lot of different ways to look at what's
going on right now for the average investor. I know it can be kind of overwhelming, which is why
I recommend that most viewers work with a good financial advisor, work under the guidance of a
good financial advisor, but importantly, one who takes into account all the macro issues that we
talk about in this channel, including the ones that Bob and I talked about here. And you know,
when you add those series of requirements together, the universe of financial advisors
really gets pretty small. So if you've got a good one who's doing well and will buy you for that,
great, stick with them. They are worth their weight in gold. If you don't, though, you'd like
a second opinion from one who does consider talking to one of the ones that's endorsed by
Thoughtful Money. To do that, just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com, fill out the very short

to work with these guys. It's just a free public service they offer to help people position
prudently today in advance of what may be likely to happen down the road. Alright, Bob, thanks for
your patience there. We're now back to you. What's one non-monetary related investment you think is
worthwhile considering? One of the things that's really, I think, been compelling in the course of
my life is walking, which is, you know, this is going to be, it feels like a pretty low-key
idea, but you'd be surprised at the magnitude of the benefits that come with walking,
both intellectual benefits in terms of, you know, creativity and thinking through problems. Some of
the best work that I do and thoughts that I come up with occur on the morning walk with a dog or a
quiet walk with a colleague. And also, I think one of the things that's even more compelling about it
is, you know, there's so many people so focused on, you know, various forms of exercise. You know,
there's no meaningful health difference between similar distance walking and things like running
and other cardio outcomes. And actually, one of the things that came out in the middle of COVID,
which didn't get nearly as much press as probably deserved, is 12,000 steps a day reduces all-cause
mortality by 60% once you account for all the typical issues like smoking and diet and other
exercise and other health conditions, which like, if I told you, what's one thing you can do to
reduce your probability of death by two-thirds, like, would you do it? You know, you probably
should. So, you know, 12,000 steps, do it. I'm so glad you brought that up. I completely
agree. And more important than me agreeing with you are guys like Mark Sisson and Peter Attia,
who are some of the greats now in the functional health space. Mark Sisson has been doing this for
much of his career. He's in his 70s now. He still looks amazing. And he was a big runner. That was
sort of his on-road to health, fitness. And I heard him interviewed recently and they sort of
asked him, "Hey, you know, what are some big changes, you know, you may have made as your
thinking has evolved?" And the top of his list was walking. And he said, "I kind of looked down
as a runner, you know, but as I got older and I started walking more and I actually saw the
benefits of the two," he said, "I think that walking is the perfect exercise for humans."
He said, "It's the movement that our bodies are most evolutionarily adapted for and the health
benefits of it are great." And there's a lot of data out there where folks, you know, can go find,
see the proof of that on their own. But the thing you also mentioned that I just want to underscore
is the mental health benefits and sort of the expansive thinking. And I assume,
I presume what you're saying when you're walking, that's walking in a disconnected state from
digital distractions, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah, for sure. That's actually having a dog is the best
thing for a walking environment because, you know, you have to pay attention to your dog the whole
time. Well, you know, I'd also just say having a dog is the best thing. They are the best mental
health boost in the world because, you know, having somebody that treats you like you're the
most important person in the universe to come home is great. All right. Well, look, we'll have
to wrap it up there but wonderful answers all across the board. Bob, really appreciate your time
here. Thanks so much for coming on the channel. Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
