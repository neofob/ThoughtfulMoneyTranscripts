Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm Thoughtful Money founder and your host, Adam Taggart, welcoming you back here at the end of another week for a
weekly market recap, featuring my Caressant friend, Lance Roberts. Lance, how are you doing today, buddy?
I have no idea what Caressant means, but okay. I'm not caressing nothing. That's all I'm saying.
Well, Caressant means glittering or shimmering very much the way that precious metals do, and they've been having a heck of a run recently.
So as everything else, I mean, pick an asset glass. It's all going up.
Yeah. Well, we'll talk about bonds in a little bit, but yes, it's been a long battered and bruised precious metals holders are finally having
their moment in the sun right now. How long will it last? Who knows? Maybe we'll talk about that a little bit.
Alright, so interesting week in the markets this week. It looks like they are going to end lower this week, which has become a rarity of late,
as you kept reminding us. This has been one of the longer streaks in history for the S&P. A lot more volatility in the S&P this week.
It is bouncing today, Friday that we're talking, because of a jobs report, which I'm sure we'll talk about in just a minute, but love to hear
what you think about the momentum of the market right now. This week looked like a pause that refreshes and things pick back up at some point,
or are you seeing indicators that this monster rally may be getting played out here?
Well, on Thursday, we did break below the 20 day moving average, which has been that key support line now for a while. That doesn't really mean
anything. We've done that before. During this rally, we've broken below the 20 day moving average before. So again, with technicals, it's always very
important not to make a knee-jerk move based on one day's worth of action. But it is certainly, this is the first kind of crack in the bullish armor
that we've seen in the last several months. So it's worth at least paying attention to. The indicators have rolled over. They're on sell signals.
Relative strength is declining. They're not oversold yet, but it is getting weaker. So again, this is kind of that first crack in the armor, so to speak.
Now, if the market rallies back on Friday, which it's doing, so as we're talking right now, the market's up, we haven't gotten back above that 20 day
moving average yet. But if we close above the 20 day moving average on Monday, it negates the break. So you just don't do anything where you stay within
the bullish trend and everything is fine. So again, it's always important what you're looking for is a confirmation of action. So in other words,
when you break the 20 day moving average, let's say on Friday, we close out the day at the 20 day. Then on Monday, we turn and go lower. That's now a
confirmed break because you rally back to what was previously support. It's now resistance. And if you take out the low from Thursday, you now have a
confirmed break of that trend line. And so now you should expect lower prices over the course of the next week or so.
All right. If you're able to, Lance, why don't you bring up the S&P chart here just so folks can visualize what we're talking about here. So as you're
pulling those up from past weeks, you've talked about how the markets have been above all of the moving averages for a prolonged period of time, and
have been consistent in saying that what you're first waiting for is to see if it breaks below the 20 DMA. It now has, as you just said, so now we're
in a, I would imagine, a relatively important period here, where we're going to find out whether or not what you said just happens. Does it break back
above and it runs back into the channel that it's been in and all is good? Or does that 20 DMA all of a sudden switch from support to resistance? And
if it does, let's just assume for a second it does, okay? What would you do next?
But then that's where you take some profits and raise some cash, put on hedge, whatever you want to approach your portfolio management. But that's where
you want to start taking a little bit more serious action about taking profits and recent winners, trimming back on some losers, raising a little bit of
cash in the portfolio. If you kind of understand how to hedge, you could put on some option hedges or you could short the market a bit. So there's some
things you can do. But yeah, that's where you start taking those actions. You don't do it all at once. You don't go to 100% net short, right? But you
start layering in hedges as you go forward. Because again, all asset classes are correlated now. So if we start to see a more significant downturn in the
market, and this is an article I'm writing for Tuesday right now, talking about margin debt, we've had a very big increase in margin debt here, as of
late. One way we look at margin debt is looking at what we call free cash balances. And so if you take a look at margin debt, you also have the credit
available in a margin account and your cash. So if you subtract out the cash and the credit available from the actual debt that's outstanding, you can
either see positive or negative cash balances. And right now we have a near record level, we're just not too far away from the record negative cash
level of balances that we had back at the peak of the market in 2021. So investors are all in. And again, when you talk about margin debt as an
example, it's just a function of sentiment. valuations track consumer sentiment, margin debt tracks consumer sentiment as well. And so consumer
sentiments been rising, everybody's very bullish in the market, investor sentiments very high. And so it's not surprising that people are leveraging
up their bets right now in the market by taking on margin debt. So, you know, at some point, if you begin to get a more earnest correction in the
market, that selling reduces collateral values in account, which means after reduced margin debt, which increases more selling, and that's how you get
these 10, these 10% corrections in the market will occur with a decline in margin debt. So it's worth, you know, kind of just all these things are
coincident. But you know, what you're looking for is that change in attitude where, and I talked about this on the show last week is that, you know, if
you think about the market, it's just buyers and sellers. And, you know, right now market prices are going up because buyers are going, Okay, I'll,
you know, I want to buy stock, I want to buy, you know, anything that moves right now, I want to buy gold, I want to buy energy, I want to buy, you
know, S&P stocks, whatever. So everything started moving up together, and sellers are on the other side going, Yeah, I'll sell to you, but you're
gonna have to pay me more for it. And so sellers are moving the price higher to, to sell something to a buyer at some point in the marketplace.
Well, what happens is, is when this all reverses, all of a sudden, there's no buyers and sellers are going, Okay, now I want to sell, I want to sell
earnestly, and there's no buyers there. So there's an old saying that sellers live higher, buyers live lower. And the problem is, buyers right now are
probably somewhere closer to 5000 on the index, maybe 4800, than they are at 5200.
Okay, a lot of time back there. Let me just make sure everybody fully gets margin debt. Margin debt is basically borrowing to buy shares of stock,
right? And it's a generally a sign of bullish sentiment, which is I'm going to borrow to buy the stock, because I think the stock is going to go up in
price, and then I can sell it, I can pay off the margin debt, and I can pocket the difference, right? Right. And I heard you say that margin debt
ratios are near all time highs right now, which generally tends to be a sign of investor confidence. Maybe it's speculation, right? Investors are
worrying less about risk, right? Okay, great. So you're pulling up a chart of this here. So I don't want to be too leading here, but is our high margin
debt percentages generally a late stage sign of a run up, right? It's where people are kind of throwing, tossing risk aside and just saying, yeah,
whatever it takes to buy stock.
Right. Yeah. And you can kind of see in them. And so what this chart is, is this isn't an actual chart of margin debt, right? So this is a chart of free
cash balances versus the S&P. So this is margin debt, less credit and cash. And right now, what this is showing is that investors are
about as levered up as they can get in terms of their margin accounts. So they're in on margin very heavily right now. So and again, as you can
see, it's fine. Now, here's the important thing about margin. Margin debt by itself is inert. And you'll hear a lot of people say, well, margin
debt doesn't matter. It's just coincident with the market going up. And that's a very true statement, as I was talking about, is that, and I can
show you this chart, too. So this is, as you know, what I was saying was, is that there's a very high correlation between changes in margin
debt and consumer confidence. So as consumers are getting more confident, and investors are getting more confident, they're willing to take on
more risk. Well, people will tell you, it's like, oh, well, margin debt doesn't matter. That just that just fuels the market to go higher.
It's just additional buying power for the market. Absolutely a correct statement. By itself, margin debt is entirely inert. But like I think I
explained to you last week here on the show about, you know, we were talking about the markets and leverage and other stuff. But it's, you know,
dynamite is very much the same way. If I just give you the ingredients for dynamite, it's, it's harmless, right? You just have a pile of a
bunch of ingredients. But once that you blend them all together, and create a byproduct of those ingredients, it's still inert, right? I now
have dynamite, but as long as I store it properly, it's completely fine, right? I just nothing happens to it. Now, if I stick a match on it,
it's a totally different story. Right? And that's the same thing with margin debt is that on the way up, margin debt is supportive of the
rally. So the more margin debt that we pile on into the market, the higher the market will ultimately go, because it is a function
ultimately, of the the S&P itself. So it's just more buying power. And you can see in this this chart, it's just simply a ratio, it's just
showing margin debt versus the S&P 500. So as margin debt's going up, so is the S&P completely expected? The problem though, and this is
where the bulls get trapped, is that margin debt works in reverse. And the problem is, is that margin debt's like gasoline on the way up,
it's completely inert. But when you start getting selling, and you get enough selling to trigger, you know, people to liquidate that
margin, then all of a sudden, it amplifies the selling because now I have to sell in order to cover my margin as I sell to cover my
margin, I have less collateral, which is the collateral that backs the margin line, which requires me to sell more stuff to cover that
decline, and so forth, and so on. And so while it is very true that margin debt supports bull markets, it also supports corrections and bear
markets. And you can see that every time that margin debt is turned lower, you've had a correction in the market.
Yeah, and that's one of the things I wanted people to be aware of here is, and I like your dynamite analogy, you know, it takes you a while to
create the stick of dynamite, it takes you an instant to destroy it. And so you use this analogy often with stock valuations about this sort of
stretched rubber band, and when it gets to its maximum, it then sort of snaps back. And one of the things that accelerates the speed of the snap
are these margin calls, which are basically for sales. It's your brokerage saying, "Hey, you don't have enough money left in your margin
account, you got to cover your margin debt." And then so you have to sell any asset you have that still has value to be able to meet that margin
call. In fact, if you don't do it, they may actually do it for you.
And that is exactly the point that I wanted to bring up, which is that margin calls are not a choice. They give you the courtesy of calling you up and
say, "Hey, Adam, you've got a margin call on your account, so I either need you to put in more cash, or you need to sell something to cover the
margin." Well, if you don't contribute the cash, and if you don't voluntarily sell something, they'll liquidate your account for you. And they'll
liquidate more than they need in order to make sure that that line is covered, because the selling is not at your discretion. It's at their
discretion, right? So they're the lender, and you've provided them collateral. And this is the big risk that people really don't understand
about when they start taking on a bunch of margin debt. They don't really understand the risk. Is it that, "Oh, yeah, the stock market's
declining, but it's going to be fine. I'm not really worried about it. It's fine. Long-term, it's going to be great, so I've got all this leverage
in my account." Then all of a sudden, halfway through the decline, the broker-dealer calls up and says, "Yeah, you need to liquidate 50% of
your account to cover that margin call, because we're going to reduce that credit line to you." You don't have a choice, right? You may be
correct that longer term, the market's going to go up. But in the heat of the moment, where banks start to get concerned, and broker-dealers
start to get concerned about their solvency, if they've got a lot of margin debt extended out to investors, they'll call that line in to make
sure that they're solvent.
So this is where last week's discussion about sellers living higher and buyers living lower, and I brought up the importance of the marginal
buyer. This is where it begins to become really important, because if the most speculative buyer suddenly taps out, he just says, "I'm
done," then the question is, "Well, where is the next buyer down?" If you're at a sentiment turning point in the market, that next buyer might be
down at a level that's going to trigger a whole bunch of margin calls. All of a sudden, it can be, again, this sort of accelerated forced event, and
so it didn't happen all the time like this, but this is where you get these potentially big drawdowns, and the fact that you're saying that we're
kind of near record high margin debt levels, it's kind of like that stick of dynamite that you created has a lot of extra nitroglycerin in it.
So if it gets dislodged.
Right. Now, look, let me be really clear, okay, that I'm not telling you right now is like, "Oh my gosh, we've got a high level of negative cash
balances. You need to get out of the market." I'm not saying that at all. All I'm saying is that we need to be aware that this is just another
indicator of exuberance in the market. That's all it is. And in the article that I'm writing for Tuesday, I quote Howard Marks, and back in
December of 2020, Howard Marks said, "Hey, there's not a lot of value out there in the markets right now. People are piling in to leverage.
There's not a lot of value in the market, and I'm concerned about where we are." That was December of 2020. Now in 2021, the market just went
through this melt up because of all the stimulus checks, $120 billion a month in QE, zero interest rates. The market just melted up for an
entire year. So Howard Marks was very wrong. And so everybody's pointing out at that point in time, it's like, "Oh, Howard Marks was completely
wrong about his no value in the market thing." Well, 12 months later, he turned out to be absolutely right. And the reversal of all that leverage
wiped out all the gains of 2021. So if you had just sold when Howard Marks told you to sell, you would have been just fine. Now hindsight's
2020, and that's easy to say. But the point is that margin debt is a terrible technical indicator, like valuations. Valuations are a terrible
technical indicator. You should never use them to manage your portfolio. They are great determinants of risk in the overall market. And that's
why I'm bringing attention in this article on Tuesday, because basically, I couldn't find anything else to write about right now. But margin debt is
certainly at least worth paying attention to because it's just, again, just kind of pushing back to how exuberant investors are getting in markets.
And again, it's everything. It's gold. Oh, gold's gone up too much now and I'm going to buy silver. So silver is now going up. Bitcoin, stocks, it's
every asset class. So you just really kind of throw money somewhere in the market and you're going to make money.
Yeah. So I just hear you raising this to say, "Hey, look, if a correction happens, it could be swifter and more violent than the markets
expecting or that most investors expect because of the margin debt thing here." And the other thing I want to note about it is when you have these
sort of cascading margin calls, if you get into that type of scenario, and no guarantee we are, but if we do, it tends to be a baby with a bathwater
scenario where even "good assets" go down in price because people, as I said earlier, are forced to sell whatever has kept its value to meet the margin
calls. So it can create this selling vortex that kind of just takes the whole market down for a period of time.
Right. And this is also where investors make really bad decisions. So when they start getting these margin calls and these liquidation notices and stuff,
they go, "Well, I'm already down in this stock a whole bunch, so I don't want to sell." So a good example of this, we can go back. I remember, this is way
before probably most of your listeners' ages, but back in 1999, in the last century, Cisco was the hot company. It was the Nvidia of the time.
And I remember that Cisco was like $80, $85 a share. Well, as it went down in 2000, margin calls were coming in, and Cisco got to like $20 a share during
the crash. But people didn't want to sell it because they're like, "Oh, I'm already down so much on it. I don't want to sell that stock." So they started
selling all their good companies. Smallcap was still doing fine. So they were selling all of their winners so they could try to keep their losers.
And so what happens inevitably is that investors, in the heat of the moment, start making really bad decisions about their portfolio management strategy,
and we tend to sell the wrong assets. And to your point, it's kind of baby with the bathwater. And then once you start getting far enough down that ladder,
then people just go, "I'm out." And they just sell everything, and then they don't come back to the market for five or eight years.
Right. And this is why you got to care that if you're like, "Ah, I'm not in the hot Nvidia super micro stocks. I'm just in the safe blue chips." It's like,
yeah, you might be safe there, but if it gets bad enough like we're talking about here, you might not for the reason you just mentioned.
Yeah. And again, look, I just want to be really clear. I'm not trying to issue a panic alarm or anything of that. It's just one of those kind of those
coincidence things that I pay attention to, like valuations, like deviations from long-term means. Margin debt is just one of those sentiments of,
or one of those measures of investor sentiment, which is just suggesting that we're getting fairly extreme.
Okay. Can you do me a favor? Can you bring the S&P chart back up? Because there are a few questions I had there before I sidetracked you on the margin debt
side of things. So you mentioned a couple of things I want to look into here. One, you said that the MACD and the RSIs have triggered cell signals.
Can you just point out those cell signals on the chart here?
Yeah. So the upper chart is just your very basic, so the MACD is a measure of the distance between two moving averages. So it's called the moving average
convergence divergence. So are they converging or are they diverging from each other? That's the question. The blue line is kind of the
signal, is kind of the measure of the divergence convergence. The red line is the signal. So when the indicator crosses below the signal line,
that's kind of technically your cell signal. And it's been very unusual this time because it has been, this market has been so complacent.
It's been a very tight trading range, just kind of grinding higher. And so really, the MACD line has been pretty much flat. And that's fairly
unusual. If we go back in time, we don't see a lot of periods where it's just these very long, flat periods where things are going on.
Typically, you know, if you get a cell signal, the market's declining along with it. If you got a buy signal, then the markets are rallying with
it. So again, it's been very unusual about how flat that this indicator has been over the last several months. Again, not unprecedented. This
has happened before, particularly back in 2017. We had a very complacent market and very similar type thing. Then, of course, 2018 comes
along, you have a near 20% sell off in January and February, then you have a 20% decline in October, November, December of that year. So, you
know, these these periods of complacency tend to lead to periods of non complacency. So again, this is this one kind of thing is paid to
but we do have a decent sell signal going on, it's fairly spread right now below the signal, the market is declining, again, just kind of
one of those cracks. And you know, we've been noting in the bottom, which is the relative strength index that we've had this very
compressed kind of relative strength in the market has just been kind of hanging right around that overbought level, finally broke below
that kind of that consolidation pattern. Now, again, does that mean anything at this moment? No, it's a market rallies right back up into
the trend channel and heads back to the kind of the previous high, which would be around 5200. Then this will all reverse and we'll we'll
start going up again. But again, this is just in the real short term. It's just, hey, this is the first time we've actually seen some
volatility pick up in the market, because we've seen that in a while. I mean, it's been a really, really complacent market. In fact,
we just take a look at the VIX versus the RSI. You know, this is just been this uptick in volatility that we you know, we just haven't
seen in a while and all of a sudden, everybody just kind of woke up was like, wow, volatility Oh, and that does exist. I laugh, because
you're saying volatility is coming back, but but yeah, go back. Yeah, it's still not existed, but at least it up ticked a little bit. I
mean, you know, it we didn't even had that lately. So, you know, again, it's just been a super, super complacent market. It's, it's, you
know, it's all, you know, it's just bullish. And so, you know, the only thing interesting from this week is that for the first time in a
couple of weeks, actually, and this is the first time in five months, that there's actually something worth interesting kind of talking
about.
Okay. All right. So let me ask this other set of questions. So going to the the S&P chart there in the middle. So we talked about that if
the, if the index rises up to the 20 day moving average, and gets rejected, then that's going to be assigned to you to do your first wave of
taking gains off the table. And, you know, maybe going a little bit more to cash, right? Right. Okay. So now, if, if after hanging out down
there for a while, it punches back up through the 20 day moving average back into the channel, presumably, you would you would start buying
more again, right, you go back to your current allocations. If it doesn't, if instead, it keeps falling, what's your next milestone? Is it the
50 day moving average before you take action?
Yeah, now, so no, we know if we get a confirmed break at the 20, then we'll start taking some action, then the 50 day will become the next kind of
major challenge. If we fail there, we'll take even more action. And but again, all this is going to kind of coincide with what, you know,
kind of sentiments doing, as well as kind of what the overbought oversold conditions are. So if we get, you know, we're at the 50 day moving
average, and we're very oversold, and sentiment is reversed, you know, markedly, then we're going to be probably much more aggressive buyers.
If not, and it looks like we're going to take out the 50 day and continue to go lower, kind of like we did last summer, which I fully my
expectation is still between now and the election, that we're going to have a similar event to last summer where we get a 10% correction.
And we retest that 200 day moving average at some point this year. That's where I'll be a much more aggressive buyer, particularly if that happens
before the election, we get sentiment very oversold. That'll be a great setup heading into the election and the eventual outcome of that.
So again, you kind of take this little day by day and let the market tell you what to do. I wouldn't try to anticipate anything because
there's, you know, just so much going on in this markets right now, that is bullish. And again, the economic data remains very strong.
There's nothing underlying really the earnings story, earnings are doing better, earnings are improving, markets will rise with improving
earnings. So there's no reason to be bearish on the markets right now. Inflation is going to subside, economic growth will slow
some, the Fed's going to cut rates later this year. That's all bullish for equities. So again, no reason to be overly concerned, but look for
correctional processes and opportunity to put capital to work. But again, we also want to try to avoid some of those downturns as well by
mitigating some risk in the process.
Okay. All right. So you talked about how volatility suddenly come back, at least a little bit into the markets. It was funny to see how quickly
kind of the market sentiment changed from, "Hey, nothing stopping this train," to a little bit of wobbling, and then the fear and greed
index was pinned on greed and now I think is right in the middle. So it is pretty impressive or notable how quickly people go from, "We don't have a
care in the world," to, "Oh, wait a minute. We're a little bit nervous now."
Yeah. I don't like the CNN fear/greed gauge for a variety of reasons. I mean, it is good. I don't have a problem with it at all, but it's not a very
good indicator relative to really kind of what's happening in the markets. And so this is why every week in our newsletter, we produce a fear/greed
gauge that's based on actual allocations. So again, it's one thing about sentiment. So when you take a look at the CNN fear/greed gauge, it
actually has the S&P in it. So you're using the S&P to measure the S&P. Not really what you want. You want a set of indicators to measure or to
suggest what the S&P is reflecting, right? So I don't want to include that in a measure. So this is, can you see this? Yeah.
I can, yep.
Yeah. So, actually, in the last week, this measure of our fear/greed gauge was at 84. It actually went up 4.8 points this week. And this is current
as of today. So fear/greed index based on allocation actually rose this week and is at an extreme greed level. So that hasn't really changed
much. And you can see historically, again, it's not a precise indicator. But typically, when you get to historically high levels, kind of where
we are now, when you get to 88, 89, 90 above, that's typically been closer to decent market peaks.
Yeah, it's just not much more greedy you can get, right? It's just at an extreme. Okay, but I think my point still stands, which is if you looked
at the headlines, if you looked at kind of the talking heads, all of a sudden, folks were showing a little bit of nervousness, right? A couple of
sweat beads there on the ground. It didn't take much. That's my whole point. It doesn't take much. And one of the things that I think contributed
to that was all of a sudden a realization that, hey, inflation's still sticky, jobs are still doing well, and of course, we're going to talk
about the crazy latest blowout, impossible to swallow jobs report. But this sense of like, whoa, wait a minute, maybe the Fed, yeah, we were
initially thinking it was going to hike a lot this year, seven times, the Fed kind of beat us down to three hikes to expect, but now, maybe they're
not even going to be able to do three hikes. And you just had Boston, Atlanta Fed's CEO, Boston, come out and say, maybe we're only going to do one
cut, like in Q4, right? So, as has been the pattern for the past two years, practically, the market is having to shift its expectations about how much
the Fed is going to give it a tailwind this year. So, that is one thing that could shift market valuations, right? If the market just says, "Hey, look,
we've been overly optimistic about cuts."
Yeah. Well, I mean, this whole market has been rallying on rate cuts, and actually, even during the correction in 2022, we kept having these huge rallies
on expectations, "Oh, the Fed's going to cut rates," and they wouldn't cut rates. But I've been saying since last year, there's no reason for the Fed to cut
rates. And if I'm Jerome Powell, I'm not cutting rates, right? I'm doing QT to reduce my balance sheet. Inflation is coming down. The economy is slowing.
So, I'm getting everything I want. Why would I cut rates at this point and potentially fuel a surge in activity that leads to inflation and undermines the whole
thing I'm working on? So, again, I know that the banks control the Fed, the banks want lower rates to help them out. I get it. So, the Fed's going to
acquiesce at some point, but there's really no reason to cut rates.
Liquidity, despite what everybody keeps talking about, it's like, "Oh, liquidity. Liquidity is fine."
Liquidity has actually been rising in the market. In fact, I just posted a tweet out this morning
of liquidity. And if you take a look at the liquidity index as a function of the market,
it continues to just keep going up. And so, there's no reason, really, again, there's just no reason
for the Fed to cut rates at the moment. So, this is a really interesting point because you're right,
there's no visible reason where typically if the Fed is going to cut, it's in response to something,
where it's trying to help out a slowing economy. And so, very easy to make the argument of, "Hey,
look, if anything, you should be thinking about raising rates because we're more of a danger of
the economy running too hot than too cold." Before I continue, I'll let you make whatever
comments you want to make. No, I was just -- this is the comment. I mean, this is the chart just
while you were talking. This is the chart of liquidity versus the S&P. And so, S&P has been
going up because liquidity is going up. So anyway, so keep going. Okay. So, we scratch our heads and
say, "Okay, then why is Powell cutting here?" So, if we listen to Powell, it's a message of
confidence, right? It's that, "Hey, we brought CPI down from over 9% in the threes, and we're
on our way down to two. And we don't want to wait until we're at two to start cutting because the
momentum will take us below 2% inflation, and we'll have too low inflation," which of course,
no consumer would cry tears over, but whatever the Fed doesn't want to do that. So, that's what
Powell is saying. Now, of course, there's another question out there, which is maybe he's thinking
of cutting out of fear, right? Which is that there's something that he sees that makes him
worried that if the Fed doesn't begin to add additional duct tape and strengthen its patchwork,
that something systemic could break, right? And this could be due to the lag effect that we talked
about. It could be troubles in the banking system. Maybe once now that the BTFP is closed and the
reverse repo programs almost out of juice, the bite of QT is going to start being felt much more
acutely. Who knows? And I'm going to talk in a bit about the interview that I just released on this
channel with former St. Louis Fed CEO and former voting member of the FOMC, Thomas Honig. Really,
I think, honestly, folks, the most important interview I've done yet,
and I asked him this question directly, and even he thinks there's elements of truth in both of
this. And he's actually quite concerned about the banking system, which we'll talk more about in a
little bit, which is important because Honig was a director of the FDIC. This isn't just a guy with
an opinion. This is a guy who truly understands banking system risk. So, I don't know, Lance.
You can definitely look at the decisions, the insistence that Powell keeps saying, "No, no,
yes, we're going to stick to our 2% inflation goal, but still expect us to cut at some point this year."
And then, look, as I said, the banks control the Fed at the end of the day. So, if you take a look,
these banks still have huge massive capital losses on their bond portfolios right now. So,
the banks want lower rates. If the Fed cuts rates, interest rates come down,
bond collateral values go up, it heals that problem. So, for the banking system,
lower rates is great. Also, lower rates are going to spark demand for loans, etc.
And they're sitting on this, talk about dynamite, I mean, they're sitting on these commercial real
estate loans that are just bleeding from the eyeballs right now, right?
So, yeah, you get rates down, then that increases demand for real estate, etc.
So, yeah, lower rates are good for asset classes, period. And so you can understand why the banks
are pushing for it. Right. But to your point, it makes the simple question of like, "Well,
why are we thinking about rate cuts here?" Really complicated when you start pulling at these
different strings and we don't know, obviously, right? We're not being told the full story here.
All right. Well, look, so we've got the markets still continuing to hang out near all-time highs.
Again, momentum has paused this week. We'll see what happens with this key 20-day moving average,
whether it regains its support level or whether it in fact becomes resistance.
But one thing that happened today and the day we're talking, Lance, is we got yet another
jobs report. And hey, big surprise, it's another four sigma beat, right? And actually,
I'm going to try to find some charts I have here that show just how crazy this has been
and how I think they say now it is actually statistically impossible to – let's see if
this is the right – no, it's not the chart I'm looking for. Statistically impossible to have this
many like three, four and five sigma beats in a row. But anyways, I'll pull it up in a second.
Yeah, so jobs came in at 303,000 versus an estimate of 210,000. So really big beat.
The unemployment rate has come down again to 3.8%. First off, we continue to be in this cycle where
it's, "Hey, look at this amazing number that we put out there. Yes, we're kind of writing down
every other number that we told you about. Don't worry about that stuff anymore. We didn't know
what we were doing then." But believe this massive number. So first off, just any general commentary
or reaction to this. Of course, the markets use this as a – I don't even know what world we're
in right now. It's like good news is good news for the markets. Bad news is good news for the market.
But I guess markets are taking this as a sense that Powell doesn't have to worry about the
jobs market that much so he can do whatever he needs to do. The one positive news out of this
was the household survey actually added 419,000 jobs, so fairly big increase. The one thing that
nobody's talking about is that we pulled Easter into March this year. Remember, Easter was at the
end of March. So all that seasonal hiring for Easter, which normally happens in April,
occurred in March. So we did see an uptick in hospitality, retail services, those type of things.
You saw an uptick in employment in that area to help service those Easter sales. Now that's over,
so we could very well see those jobs. You kind of see some job losses pick up in April
as that seasonal hire kind of goes away. You also had spring break, which you need people like my
daughter had a job over spring break at the water park outside of her college. So again, we had
spring break, which also people go skiing, a lot of vacation. So you had a lot of stuff that happened
in the month of March that required leisure and hospitality employment, which is where a big bulk
of that employment came from. Also, again, illegal immigration is helping the employment roles.
Okay, yeah. All right. So I was going to talk about that. Why don't we talk about that right
now? People are finally figuring out that illegal immigration is impacting the economy.
It's like, now you get it now, but okay. Yeah. So let's see here. You guys see in this chart? Okay.
So this basically shows the change in employment since October, 2019. So what is that? That's four
and a half years ago. And native born workers, that number is actually down 1.4 million. So
negative 1.4 million compared to a 3 million gain in foreign born workers. And they don't break out
legal and illegal immigrants and the foreign born workers. But what's interesting is I'm just seeing
more and more, suddenly more and more articles really pointing this out. And my question is,
with people's growing frustration about jobs, real wages, like not keeping up with cost of living,
this is, I think, almost sort of on a collision course to become a real election issue. Because
we had our immigration or our broken immigration, or at least our broken border policy has for a
while now been kind of like the number one issue that people have said they're going to use to vote
on. And increasingly people's dissatisfaction with their economic situation is becoming one as well.
This kind of blends the two together, where it's like, wait a minute, this broken border
policy is actually now, it looks like it's part of a reason for why I'm not doing so well.
So true or not, it's just this sort of emerging narrative. So I'm curious to hear your thoughts
on this. No, it's true. If you go back to that chart that you showed of foreign born versus
immigration, you'll note that prior to 2020, we had a fairly secure border. We still had
immigration come across the border. So don't think we didn't. We did, but we had shuttered down a lot
of that immigration and we're getting the border under a bit of control. Then right after 2020,
when President Biden took over his first day in office, he basically repealed a lot of those
border policies put in place by the previous administration. And you can just see all of a
sudden you just have this big surge of immigration coming into the country. So both legal and
illegal. You can't define one versus the other, but you are starting to see a lot more articles
being written now, studies, et cetera, talking about how the immigration issue is, what is the
driver for these strong employment numbers? And again, it's primarily these foreign born workers.
And to your point, if I'm a native born worker and I'm wanting to try to get a job, we're hearing the
frustration coming from people about, I can't get a job. There's no jobs out there. I'm sending out
thousands of resumes. But again, you also have to qualify and quantify what type of jobs are we
talking about? These immigration jobs that are coming in, these are those leisure hospitality
jobs that a lot of people don't want. So I'm trying to apply for $100,000 job. I'm not out
there applying for these lower wage paying jobs in restaurants or driving an Uber or whatever.
That's going to people that will take those jobs. So let me show you this chart here,
which I think is related, which is in a very large shift from the previous election cycle.
The importance of the economy is much higher now as a percentage for younger voters than it was
before. That's my whole point, which I think is related to this, which is because these are the
more entry level, the more unskilled jobs. A, I think they're finding a market that's cooling off
much faster than we're being told in the official numbers. But at the same time, I think they're
finding that there's more competition for it. There was a great video out a couple of weeks
ago that went viral and it's this young girl. She just graduated college and she's got her
certificates from college in her lap. And she's like, "I've graduated college. I have two degrees
and a certificate and I can't get a job. And I only got one job offer from Bart who has a tech
company. He wants me to answer his phones. No, Bart, I don't want to come answer your phones."
And so that's our whole shtick, right? So the issue is that if you start looking at a certificate,
I believe it was a liberal arts degree of some sort. And again, when you're graduating college,
your first job is not going to be in a corner office making 150 grand a year unless you're
an engineer or something like that. You're going to have an entry level job and we've raised kind
of a generation of students that are not willing to take those jobs. And so those jobs are going
to go to people who will gladly take that job. If I'm here legally or illegally, if somebody's
willing to offer me a job, I'm going to take it. So to my point, I'm not marking this because my
sense is we may talk more about it as we get close to the election, because this seems like it's
going to increasingly be a big voting point for people. What's also interesting too is we've
talked a lot about the big disparity, even in some of the BLS's own methodologies, like the
difference between the establishment survey and the household survey. And I'm beginning to wonder
if, and I'm seeing people write about this, is maybe that's not due just to broken models or
fudge factors or stuff like that, that it may also be due to the fact that there are a lot more
undocumented people that are working the jobs where if you call up the household,
I don't think they're calling up undocumented households. So there maybe is some undercounting
going on in some of these methodologies because the growing share of people that
are illegal and undocumented aren't being picked up in the official measurements.
Well, that's right. And again, there's been an article out on Thursday talking about the ADP
report. ADP reported 180,000 jobs. Still, that was better than expected also, by the way. Again,
not surprising because of Easter and spring break all in the same month. So we did see a pickup of
180,000 jobs on ADP. And everybody's like, "Yeah, but ADP is never right. It's been a poor
correlation to the BLS report." Maybe the BLS report is in poor correlation to the ADP report.
Maybe the ADP report is actually more accurate. We don't know because we don't get into all the
numbers. But I think that there's certainly an interesting situation that is going on right now
because of this disparity between two employment reports that we do get. But at the same time,
you don't see the pickup in jobless claims. So we keep expecting this big layoff of workers,
but yet we don't see a big pickup in jobless claims either.
Yeah. And I just want to show that I was pulling up this chart as you were talking about that.
It's a little hard to see because the scale of this chart is skewed by the times where
unemployment's gone bananas, especially during COVID. But you can see here right at the end,
you can see unemployment rate moving, continuing claims moving up, but jobless initial claims,
sorry, are still just freaking on the floor, which that's the one I have a really hard time
squaring in my brain. To me, that one does feel like broken methodology.
Yeah. There's a couple of things that we all have to remember is that first of all,
that whole COVID thing, it's screwed up every model. It's going to be years before those
modelings get sorted out because we've never had an event like that before where you shut down an
economy. And so these models are based on long-term historical trends and correlations and mathematical
measurements over time and these formulas and algorithms that they've all come up with.
And that whole COVID shutdown broke all those models. And so when we talk about these models,
there's a lot of stuff that goes back to, is the actual structure of these models actually still
valid at this moment in time? Now, eventually with time, and we get back to normalcy of hiring
and firing and all that, these models will normalize themselves out. But right now,
that break in 2020 was so large, it's likely skewing all of these models to a degree that
we're not even aware of. Yeah. And you may remember, I interviewed Nili Taminga
on this program a few weeks back. She's a consumer research analyst, and she actually talks a lot to
the folks at the BLS. And that is her takeaway, which is that the bullwhip effect of the massive
data changes because of all that firing and then quickly rehiring, it's still reverberating through
the BLS data series. And it's just like the models just, to your point, have gotten broken. It's
going to take a long time for that to equilibrate back to a point where the models actually have a
predictive sense to it. So you're highly likely right there. But there are things. This is why
airplanes, cockpits have windshields. And we can look at things like the challenger grade job cuts
are the highest they've been now since January 2023. We can look at the huge increase in Warnac
notices over the past six months. So we can see things out there that tell us that people are
getting laid off and that companies are hiring less. And so when we see that dead level, dead flat
initial jobless claims numbers, we can kind of be thinking like, "You know what? I don't think that
reader on the dashboard is actually working." Exactly. All right. So let me then get to
the -- so I mentioned about -- so back to the Fed and its guidance. So I mentioned Bostick
coming out and there's been a number of Fed speakers this week and even guys like Kashkari
have basically said, "Hey, yeah, we may not be able to do three rate cuts this year." So it is
interesting that the Fed is now -- they're not saying they're going to do less, but they are
raising multiple trial balloons, I think, to prepare the market for the fact that they could
do less this year. It's interesting because the markets are now starting to predict the Fed's
going to do less. So for the first time in a while, the market's kind of leading the Fed.
Well, we'll see. We'll see. We had the pause this week. If we punch back up in your channel,
though, maybe not, right? But I want to spend just a minute. I don't think you've had a chance
to watch it. And Lance, I will ask you if you have time over the next week to watch the Hennig
interviews just so we can talk about your reaction to it because I'd love to hear your thoughts.
Yeah, just give me some time and I'll do it. Yeah, I know. I know. But like I said, folks,
I do think that this may have been the most important interview I've done so far. And the
main reason for that, not only was it a really excellent discussion, but we spent a lot of time
talking to all the experts and analysts on this program, trying to divine what's really going on
in the halls of power at the center of the power structure. Hennig actually was there. He was in
the room. He sat at the table. And what's great about Hennig is, if you haven't read the book,
The Lords of Easy Money and don't know this, he was a real maverick on the FOMC. He was the lone
dissenting voice. He actually sent a record for the number of dissenting votes on the FOMC when
they were trying to determine if they should do QE or not. He was against it for all the reasons that
we now criticize a lot of those decisions. And so he can actually tell us how these guys think,
how the institutions actually operate. Super valuable. I got the chance to basically ask
him every question I could think of in the hour that I had for him. I still had a whole bunch we
didn't get to, and he has agreed that he'll come back on the channel. So we'll get to dive into
those other ones, folks. But not only was it really illuminating, but Lance, it was really
sadly validating. It pretty much operates the way that we've been thinking. When we think of
its shortcomings, Hennig was kind of like, "Yeah, that's pretty much the way that it is," right?
And it was sad to hear that from a guy that was involved deeply at the top level of that
institution that he was like, "Yeah, the Fed started as an emergency measure, a lender of
last resort. It has had a massive amount of mission creep since then. It probably is doing
an awful lot of things. It has no business doing. While its goal is to increase stability of markets,
there's a lot of things it does that actually ends up unintentionally actually making instability
worse," right? He talked about how unless we change our trajectory, which he doesn't think
we're going to, through any proactive or willing means, we're just going to keep killing the
purchasing power of our currency, that that's just on a destiny for the dustbin of history,
that the Fed's policies unintentionally, perhaps, but are directly responsible for the wealth gap we
have in this country and for exacerbating the wealth gap. He completely confirmed that the Fed
is under a lot of pressure when it comes to decision making. It likes to think it's
independent, but it gets a ton of pressure from DC, from Wall Street, and that definitely factors
into its decision making. And that, and this really gets me, is that the Fed is human and
when it's under pressure, it feels, it generally decides to act first for optics sake and then,
quote, "We'll figure it all out later," right? So, we have what is arguably the most important
institution in the world in terms of the global impact of its decision making. And a lot of the
times it sounds like it's kind of flying by the seat of its pants. That's exactly what I was going
to say. It's like, you have the smartest men in the room, so to speak, and it's like, let's just
do that, see how it works out. Yeah. Or just sort of the political, like, hey, we can't look like
we're doing nothing, so we have to do something and whether it's the right or wrong thing,
we'll figure it out down the road. Yeah. Maybe I won't even be here anymore and it's somebody
else's problem, right? Right. So anyways, I found that, like I said, I think it's almost essential
viewing if you're going to be a thoughtful money viewer in the long term, just to have that
background context. And again, I really did my best not to ask leading questions, not to make it
if it started off as a Fed bashing exercise, and Honing is very measured in his answers.
But yeah, I just walked away from that saying, oh my goodness, almost everything that we thought
about whatever dysfunction might lie there seems like it does. So if we are trusting these brainiacs
around the FOMC table to surgically thread the needle in the macroeconomic world that we're
facing and engineer a butterfly soft landing here, it feels like if that happens, it's going to be
more accidentally than anything intentional given the way that Honing said that things run there.
The other thing that he said is, I asked him what does he think would cause the Fed to go back to QE?
And he said, I'm not really sure in the near term, but he said one thing that definitely
will cause it to go back to QE will be a banking crisis. And as you said, Lance, that's really at
the end of the day why the Fed exists. So I asked him, I'm like, well, how do you feel about the
current stability of the banking system? He was a director of the FDIC and he said, I said, give me
a ranking one being very stable, five being chaos for the banking system's current status stability.
He said, I'd give it about a three and a half to four. I was like, wow, so you're actually pretty
worried. And he said, yeah, I'm actually pretty darn worried about these banks. We're told they're
well capitalized. He's like, they're not. So he thinks that the banking system is much more
fragile than we're being led onto here. And I just want to note the day we're talking here,
an article came out that said that they're trying to actually pressure their federal
reserve right now into permanently changing the formula for the supplementary leverage ratio,
the SLR for banks, which basically is a measure of how much leverage banks are allowed to maintain.
And they brought it down during the pandemic basically to give the banks. This is sort of
like we're suspending mark to market. It was a way to just sort of say, hey, we're not going to
look at this metric as closely as we did because we know you're in a tough spot. Well, now they're
lobbying the Fed to make that permanent. So it's just another sign that why would they be doing
that unless the banking system weren't as stable or were more unstable than what we're being told
right now. Well, yeah, but this is the whole laughable thing of their Fed stress test that
we talk about from time to time as they run these stress tests on banks. So, oh, look, all the banks
pass their tests. They're completely well capitalized. And as soon as there's a hiccup in
the market somewhere, we're bailing out banks, whether it's in 2008 or whether it's in 2023,
where we're bailing out regional banks. Credit Suisse passes the stress test and it's acquired
by UBS because it's failing like a week later. So it's absolutely laughable that people go around
like, oh, banks are well capitalized. If they are, let's stop bailing them out. Let's stop doing
everything we need to do to keep them in business when they get into trouble and just let them
survive on their own. And if you start doing that, banks will adjust their capital ratios on their
own because they want to stay in business. And they'll stop making bad loans. They'll stop taking
extreme measures of doing leveraged and collateral loans and those types of things and no doc loans,
et cetera, like in 2008. They'll stop doing that if they want to survive and stay in business.
Right now, they can take on all the risks they want. They don't have to worry about financial
stability because the Fed will bail them out. Well, so this is why I am wondering if the push
to cut here by Powell isn't driven more by fear, right? If he's not looking at the banking system
and saying, "It's going to need some help. I've got to do this less to avoid too little inflation
and I'm doing it more just to keep the banking system functioning." Look, the Fed has got to
get long-term rates down. You cannot keep rates where they both short and long-term. You can't
keep short-term and long-term rates. Money market rates cannot stay at this level because it impairs
the profitability of the banks. And like I said earlier, they have massive capital losses still
sitting on their books. You've got this commercial real estate problem. San Francisco, LA, others,
we're seeing commercial real estate buildings going off at 25 cents on the dollar. We saw some
get turned in at zero. Basically, they just walk the property. So there is definitely stress
that is sitting out there and you cannot sustain rates where they are without you actually having
much more systemic problems within the banking system. It's just a function of time as that
erodes through the system. So the Fed has got to get rates down. Okay, so this is a good segue into
the next topic I want to chat about with you, which is bonds. And bond yields are now up around
4.4 or so. So I want to get your general sense on the bond market and people ping me every week
because I'm sure they do you. And hey, ask Lance about where we are in the TLT trade and
has he changed his bonds outlook? I know your answer is going to be no. It's a dumb question.
These things don't change from week to week or day to day. I've been very clear up front. This
is a long-term process. Interest rates are a function of inflation economic growth.
That doesn't change from one week to the next. That's going to be 24, 36 months. But those will
be lower. You just simply can't sustain economic growth where it is. So it's kind of a stupid
conversation to have from one week to the next because that fundamental basis doesn't change
from one week to the next. Okay, so here's where I'm going with it, which is to your point that
rates have to come down for the reasons that you just mentioned. So right now, there's a bunch of
people, many watching this program, who are older, maybe even retired at this point, who have really
welcomed the fact that money markets are now yielding over five and a quarter.
That's my whole point. So you're saying get it while you can. So I would imagine you'd be
cautioning them to say, "Look, it feels great and yeah, maybe now you can live off your savings."
This is what everybody hoped and expected when they first started saving for retirement,
which is, "Hey, I'm going to retire with a pile of money and I'm going to be able to live off
the fixed income off of that portfolio." I hear you saying, "Don't get used to it, folks."
So what would your advice be to somebody who is kind of, we'll say, at the finish line right now,
they find themselves at the finish line, "Okay, yeah, this is great. This is an income stream I
can live off of," but you're saying it's probably not like they're going to stick around for very
long. No, not on money markets. Money markets will be back to zero within the next year or so.
So as soon as the Fed cuts rates, the money market rates will go away.
Even major banks right now, like JP Morgan, they still pay zero. So regional banks and some of these
smaller banks, they're paying higher rates to attract deposits into their business, which is
great. But as soon as rates start to fall and things start to heal up on their side, then
they're going to cut those rates because they want to keep that spread between what their cash they're
holding and what they have in collateral on their books. So that's where they make their
income from. And so those rates will drop very quickly. But no, if you're close to retirement,
go out and buy 30-year treasuries, 10-year treasuries, and lock in that rate because at
least you have that rate, regardless of what interest rates do between now and 10 years from
now, if you're happy with 4.5% on your money, lock in the rate. Okay, that's where I was going. So
your advice would be, "Hey, if this is sufficient for you, lock it in." No, that is not advice.
I'm just saying if you want a guaranteed income stream at 4, 4.5% and that's all you want,
then do that. The stock market is going to outperform you, but that's the choice you've
got to make. Okay. All right. And obviously, folks, if you are wrestling with this decision
of, "Hey, should I lock in bonds at 4+% here, or should I have an allocation? I'll have some
in the market, like Lance said, and some in bonds, whatever," that's a phenomenal discussion to be
having with your professional financial advisor. Don't try to be figuring that out on the fly alone
by yourself. All right. Here's the important part. So before you leave this,
so interest rates are exactly where they should be right now. So look, if you take a look at
inflation and economic growth as a composite index, that is correcting. So those rates are
falling after that massive surge that we had back in 2020 because of all the stimulus, the economic
shutdown, et cetera. So interest rates have now risen to compensate for inflation and economic
growth exactly as it should. There's a very high correlation historically between that index and
inflation. In fact, it's about an 85% correlation historically between the economic composite of
inflation and economic growth versus interest rates. And the reason is that if I'm lending
money, so you want me to loan you money for 10 years at 4.5%, that's what you're asking me.
So I have to compensate for that opportunity cost. So I've got to compensate for inflation,
for economic growth, for opportunity costs invested somewhere else. I've got to take advantage
of credit risk, all that type of stuff. I've got to factor that in because I'm going to loan you
money and you're going to pay me 4.5%, and that's all I'm going to get for 10 years. So it has to
compensate for inflation and economic growth. And right now, as I just showed you, they're exactly
where they should be. So interest rates are exactly at "fair value" with what's happening
in the economy. As the economy continues to slow and inflation continues to drop towards 2%,
interest rates will have to fall. They cannot go up in a falling economic environment.
Okay. And this is part of what gives you and your co-portfolio manager there, Michael Leibovitz,
the confidence to be making the bond. No, no. This is fundamentals. This isn't about having
confidence and coming up with some voodoo witchcraft. Talk to Lacy Hunt. He'll tell you
the same thing. He will. This is based on fundamentals. This is the only asset in the
market that operates only on fundamentals. Stock markets are all emotional based. Gold is pure
emotions, no fundamentals in gold. Absolutely. Bottom line, when it comes to bonds, they only
operate on fundamentals because that's the bottom line. What I meant there was your expectation that
the economy will continue to slow. Then because of the mathematical relationship, you know that
that means lower interest rates in the future, which means higher bond prices. Right. Well,
I can't loan money at 5% if the economy's at 2%. Right. So as long as the economy continues to
decelerate from here, that math will work the way that you're expecting.
Right. So your bet is if you're betting on 5% or 6% inflation or 5% or 6% indefinite interest rates,
your bet has to be the economy is going to grow at 5% or 6%. And in a world where you've got 120%
of debt to GDP and basically 130% of household debt to GDP, that doesn't work. You can't sustain
high interest rates in that environment. Got it. Okay. All right. Well, look,
I want to talk about oil price and then I want to talk about your recent piece titled investing
lessons from your mother, and then we'll start wrapping things up here. It is coming up, by the
way. Don't forget. Don't forget. Fastest way to get in trouble is to forget that one. All right.
So the price of oil has been on the move. So I'd love to basically get your thoughts on three
things, Lance. What impact is that having on energy stocks? What impact does that have on
the inflation outlook, at least in the near term? And then what are you hearing specifically?
Because you're based in Houston and I'm sure hear a lot from folks in the oil industry.
So yeah, a couple of things. So this has been an interesting year. We put oil stocks
into our portfolio in early January, and our bet was that we would see higher oil prices
for a variety of reasons. And we were coming off a deeply oversold level. And so technically,
the technicals worked out for oil prices and that's translated very well. Some of the stocks
that we bought are up very nicely since then. So again, we're just in that seasonally good period
of the year for higher oil prices, and that's been continued to kind of play. And of course,
it doesn't hurt when you have Iran and Israel potentially going at it over the weekend. So
that certainly doesn't hurt oil prices concerns over supply. And the other problem is that one
of our theses was back a while back was that the draw on the SPR has got to be replaced,
which is going to add demand to oil that wasn't there previously. And they've been trying to
refill the SPR a bit. Now they're trying to figure out how to stop doing that because gas prices have
now gone up as well. That's that inflation tick we've seen recently. And in fact, that's a really
good note, by the way, about inflation. In the latest inflation report, which was up,
it was solely transportation and a little bit of education. Outside of that, everything else was
down and CPI and the biggest components are continuing to decline, which is housing,
which is 44% of the index. So that's that temporary uptick in inflation was really mostly
a function of gasoline prices and autos. So that's very transient at the moment. And again,
higher oil prices lead to a lower economic activity. So this will all reverse, but we're
kind of getting pretty far into that trade. Again, part of what's happening in the markets is we're
seeing this exuberance kind of just spread across all asset classes. So if stocks were going bonkers
in November and December and January, then everybody goes, oh, look, energy stocks and
oil prices haven't moved yet. Let's go buy those. Let's go buy gold prices. Let's go buy this and
that and the other thing. So it's just that exuberance is now spreading across all asset
classes in the markets, but energy stocks are way overbought here. We're probably going to start
clipping. We've already taken some profits, but we'll probably clip some more profits,
I would imagine, in the next week or so. Okay. That's where I was going on this. Okay. So you've
already taken a little bit of action and probably will take more? Yeah. Okay. All right. These are
all great trades. Commodities have been doing very well lately. Like I said, gold prices have been
doing well. Just don't forget to take profits. Nothing goes in a straight line in one direction
or the other. So enjoy this return. It's been awesome. It's been a very easy stock market
to be invested in. Just don't forget to take some profits along the way. Yeah. Okay. Well,
then that leads us into common sense. So you recently wrote a piece, like I said, titled
investing lessons from your mother. These are sort of like timeless axioms for wealth building in the
markets. Why don't you walk folks through them? Yeah. I don't have a lot of graphics with these
because these are more just general lessons. And this is just trying to get people to understand
how investing works. And your mom had a lot of really great sayings when she was growing up. And
she was telling, and so the premise of this whole report is simply that your mom gave you investing
lessons that you didn't even know she gave you. And don't run with sharp objects. Don't run with
sharp objects. Don't leave the door open and all that kind of stuff. Well, when you grow up and you
start realizing you pay your own electric bill, you start closing doors. And it's kind of the
same thing in the markets is that don't run with sharp objects. Don't speculate in the markets
because that's how you're going to get hurt. So speculation is just gambling. We're seeing a lot
of evidence of that in the markets right now across the board, whether it's options or whether
we're seeing people take on margin, all those types of things. So this idea of don't run with
sharp objects is important because that's the risk you take on. Sure. You may get away with it. You
may run around the house naked with the door open and have scissors in your hand and may get away
with it for a while. But the first time you trip or the police show up, it's not going to work out
well for you. So it's kind of the same way. Second lesson is, of course, look both ways where you
cross the street. And this is what we talk about a lot here on the show, Adam, is don't be bullish
and don't be bearish. Don't pick a side. Just look both ways. Look at the bullish argument,
look at the bearish argument and focus on the fundamentals. Focus on the things that matter,
because once you get wrapped up into one camp or the other, it'll work temporarily.
My thesis is the world's going to go to hell in a handbasket, so I'm going to be long this asset
class. That's great until it doesn't happen. And the problem is you're locked into this one camp
and it's very hard to make that shift. So understand what traffic is doing and make
decisions based on both potential outcomes and however they're going to come along.
Number three is always wear clean underwear. I always thought that was funny for my mom,
because you wear clean underwear, then you get in an accident and it's not clean anymore.
But the lesson there is you're only wrong if you stay wrong. So be careful with investment
decisions. Right now, gold is a very interesting one. I like gold as a good example of this because
in 2022, gold went down with everything. We had inflation at 9% and gold went down. Did exactly
not what it was supposed to do. And so a lot of people got trapped into the gold trade and now
gold's working. And so now it's an ego thing. It's like, aha, I was right. And the problem with an
ego trade is, and particularly with an asset that has no fundamentals, is that the problem is that
when that trade changes, and it will, your ego won't let you sell because now you're right.
You've been vindicated. That's awesome. Don't forget to sell. And so the whole point is with
this lesson is you're right because you were wrong, you've now become right again. Don't go back to
being wrong again. So don't stay wrong in investment that doesn't have a lot of fundamental
underpinnings to it. Yeah, I would make that, I would expand that to say it's very well documented
research, the backfire effect, which is that when someone's beliefs are challenged, rather than
consider that they might be wrong, they double down on their initial belief. And so whether you're
right or wrong at the initial point, I would say any investment you make because of a belief,
what tends to happen is even if it goes against you from the start, you're just saying, "Okay,
well, I was early, and now I got to just wait to be right." And then there's an emotion that comes
in that says, "Well, now it's personal, and I'm not going to give this up until I am right."
That's absolutely right. And again, and this is why you can make that case about bonds right now.
It's like, "Lance, you were wrong about bonds. Bonds are not performing like they're supposed
to." And again, I've got a very long outlook on my trade. My trade is 24 to 36 months.
So for me, I'm not wrong yet. Now, eventually, if I get to some point where somehow we've magically
manifested a 5% economic growth that is sustainable, then I'll say, "Oh, I was wrong on
that trade," and we'll close it out. But that's not my only trade. I mean, that's not my only asset.
I've got a very small percentage of my portfolio invested in bonds, but I have a lot of money
that's working in equities. So again, particularly in this case, it's about being stuck all in one
asset. And if you're doing these kind of big one asset trades, you've got to really be aware of
when that thesis is right or wrong. One of the most important things is hurting in the markets.
And that's what we see a lot of that going on right now. And your mom would tell you,
"If everybody jumped off the cliff, would you do it too?" And now everybody's doing it. Everybody's
jumping off the cliff on assets and everybody's following the game. But again, this goes back to
speculation and gambling, guessing, hoping, praying, all that. This is a function of where
you get a big herd mentality in the market. Everybody's moving in one direction. And the
problem is that herd will change direction. And for most investors, they don't make that turn.
And that's why when you look back historically, investors vastly underperform the markets over
time because they make these decisions all at the wrong time. They get out at the bottoms,
they get in at the tops, they do exactly the opposite of what they should do.
So again, be careful following the herd. Number five is one of my favorites. Don't talk to
strangers because this is the most interesting one because people will listen to anybody that has
a thought about the market, especially one that confirms whatever belief there is.
So stocks are going up. They'll talk to the Uber drivers like, "Oh yeah, I'm invested in this
stock." And so they'll go out and buy that stock because the Uber driver's invested in it. Be
careful where you're getting information from, particularly in raging bull markets or in bear
markets because then everybody's negative. "Oh, the world's going to end, so you need to be all
in cash." And that's where you make these really bad decisions. And really this feeds into the
herding mentality. But we start listening to anybody that confirms our belief. So I'll watch
a YouTube video or I'll watch CNBC or I'll watch whatever it is. And some guy up there who doesn't
manage money, has no skin in the game, just some commentator like Steve Leesman, I didn't say that,
but some commentator rambling off nonsense and you go, "Well, that feeds into my theory,
so I'm going to go act on that." Be real careful with that. And that's why it's important to do
your own research, make your own assessments, look at the fundamentals, understand what
you're doing. And it's great that you hear somebody say something like, "Adam, you interview
some great people." But don't take what they say and go invest on that. Go do your own homework.
Say, "Okay, I understand what he's saying. Let me go see if I can validate that myself." And then
make your decisions based on that. So I absolutely underscore that. And that's actually a massive
reason why I created Thoughtful Money in the first place with its network of independent
financial advisors like you. You notice I don't say, "Oh, that guy said X, go do X." I say,
"Go talk to your professional financial advisor about whether this makes sense and to get their
opinion and to dissect this and beat it around, and then determine if it's the right thing for
you." The other thing that I note on this too is, say, "Don't talk to strangers." This is sort of
like the beware of the I'm from Wall Street and I'm here to help message, as we talked about last
week. Their job is to sell product. So if someone's coming to you, whether it's in an ad or a phone
call or at the grocery store or whatever, and saying, "Hey, look, for this market, do you know
about this great new product that's doing awesome? Man, you got to be in this thing." They have a
huge incentive to get you to part from your money. And honestly, I don't really care how it actually
ends up working for you. They're just trying to get their pound of flesh out of it. So be very,
very careful of Wall Street types reaching out to help you. And whenever somebody approaches you,
particularly with private placements and private equity, those type of deals,
just always ask yourself, "Why am I so lucky? Why are you coming to me with this? I'm just Lance.
Why are you coming to me with this?" When you could go to a private equity firm, they'll give
you all the money you need. So why are you so lucky? That's always a good way to start your
analysis on any type of deal. I'm not saying that all private deals are bad, but you just have to
ask why you're so lucky to get the opportunity when Elon Musk would buy the whole thing, right?
Exactly. For folks that are familiar with private equity or the venture capital world,
in those worlds themselves, there's a very small number of firms that get all the good deals.
Everybody wants those firms to be in their deals. These guys get pick of the litter every time
around and so everyone else is fighting over the scraps. So the question you need to ask yourself
when someone is coming to you and saying, "Oh, there's this great private deal. Get in." You're
like, "Well, then how come the guys who are able to take the obviously good deals haven't snapped
this up yet to your point?" Exactly. There's a total adverse selection in that space. It doesn't
mean that every private deal that makes its way to you is a bad one, but it does mean probably on
average it may be, right? So number six and seven are my two favorite. This is the polite version.
You either need to do it or get off the pot. And that's just basically procrastination. Look,
I'm guilty of this historically is that I see a good investment opportunity and I'm like,
"I really need to buy that, but it seems overbought right now." Whatever it is, I can
technically, fundamentally, whatever it is. And also I'll wait a little bit on it. But my thesis
is that this is going to be a great company for whatever reason, right? So whatever my thesis is,
but just technically I'm a little bit there. Sometimes you just got to, if you identify a
great company and they have great fundamentals, whatever it is, and you can build a thesis,
take a position. Doesn't mean you have to buy a full position, but take some action because
even historically I've got myself caught in that trap where I procrastinated and I missed the
opportunity. And I look back and I go, "I knew that was going to be a winner and I should have
put that in the portfolio and I didn't for this reason or that reason." And we all have good
reasons, but sometimes you just say, "Look, this stock's a little bit overbought right now." And
this is why we talk about when we take position in the portfolio, we start out with a small position,
a trade, and then we build on it from there because it may be overbought, but I take a
1% position. And then when the position pulls back, I add 1% to it. And as my thesis plays out,
I continue to add to the position over time. And so don't procrastinate. Procrastination
is one of the big killers for portfolio returns over time.
Yeah, let me chime in on this because I feel this personally. I'm much more wired to be
conservative, especially around money. And I'm totally okay with that. But whenever I cross the
finish line wealth-wise to my goal, it's going to be years later than it would have been if I hadn't
have been as overly conservative as I've been. At times, my conservatism has really limited my
progress where I've been, in retrospect, I've been too conservative. And I can forgive myself
for that because I know that had I risked, if I'd been the opposite, taken on too much risk and taken
on too many losses, that I'd have trouble living with. I can live with being overly conservative,
but I'm just being realistic, which is I know I would have crossed that finish line a lot sooner
if I had just had a little bit more of a moderate willingness to take acceptable risk. And so
time is money and I'm paying for my over conservatism with years that I otherwise
wouldn't have had to. We all have. I'd be a lot richer if I would have done better stuff when I
was younger. The last one is don't play with it. You'll go blind. I don't know if my mom
was just trying to scare the crap out of me. But she said it to you a lot, it sounds like.
Apparently, yes. I'm still not blind, but there you go. The investing lesson there is
don't lose sight of your intentions. Right. And so in other words, don't don't play with your money.
You know, remember why you started investing in the first place and always go back to that basic
fundamental. I have people come to me all the time. It's like, we're just talking about earlier,
right? Somebody close to retirement to say, if I can just get four percent of my money,
I'm happy with it. Are you really? Right. But if that's your goal and that's all you want,
there's nothing wrong with going buying a portfolio full of bonds, paying four percent and
locking that in for 10 years. Nothing wrong with that. As long as that four percent is really what
your goal is, that that's your focus and that's your goal. That's a completely fine investment.
You're not going to get hurt. The problem is, is that we get wrapped up into exuberance in the
markets and like, oh, why do I have these four percent bonds when the market's going up 20 in a
year? Right. So we change our whole focus and we change our whole dynamic and generally right at
the worst time. Right. That's where we start buying the peak of the market, doing everything
wrong. And we wind up losing a whole bunch of money. So, you know, establish what your goals
are. And really, that kind of goes into the last part of this, which is a lesson from my dad,
which was to keep it simple, stupid, you know, that don't overcomplicate things. You know,
I see people all the time is like, you know, they've got 10 financial advisors because they
think they're diversified that way. No, all you're doing is just massively increasing your risk.
You're creating overlap problems. You're going to dilute your returns. You're paying too much
in fees. Consolidate all your assets. Get you one good adviser that you can work with.
Focus on what it is that you want your money to do. Consolidate those assets. Get them to
all work together like they're supposed to. So, you know, kind of the rules are simple.
This is what I call a KISS portfolio strategy. Decide what your objective is. Right. Retirement,
college, buy a house, whatever. Define a time frame to achieve that goal. Determine how much
money you need to get there and how much you've got to put in on a monthly basis as well. Calculate
the return that you need on that. Build the portfolio to generate that rate of return and
make sure those returns are realistic. Right. Don't don't go in and say, you know, I've got
a hundred grand. I want to be a millionaire by next year. So if I can just get a 500% return this
year, I'll be realistic. Right. But if you have realistic goals that say, look, if I can grow my
money at five or six percent a year. And understanding them, I draw down the years,
right? I'm not going to get five or six percent every year. I'm going to draw down years,
but I'm going to be contributing on a regular basis because contributions are going to make
a big part of your overall success down the road. But you do that. You select your right asset mix
to generate those rate of returns. Manage that risk. Understand when to buy and sell stuff.
Then you'll be good. And if you don't know how to do it, go find somebody who can do it for you,
but it'll be worth the money. So it's just investing is not hard. It's just being patient
and be realistic and following the lessons. And if you don't believe me, just go ask your mom.
Well, look, timeless, timeless perspective there for folks that didn't take notes and would like to
actually read that article that you wrote that's on your website there at realinvestmentadvice.com?
Absolutely. Right on the front page.
All right. See, I did the plug for you this week.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
All right. I've got a rant and then we'll wrap things up. But real quick,
trades. Sounds like you've maybe made a couple of trades.
None this week. We've got a few that are stacking up. Again, we broke the 20-day moving average on
Thursday. We're watching today's action on Friday to see if we regain that 20-day. But we've got a
few trades that are stacking up that depending on how Friday closes out, we may execute on Monday.
So I may have some trades for you next week. Okay. All right. Well, look, I just want to end here
with something we talked about months and months ago, but I keep getting people reaching out to me
about it, which specifically is this aptitudes test that I mentioned. When I made my big
transition from working in the corporate world to jumping off that rat race into the great unknown
and ended up becoming an entrepreneur, that just didn't happen overnight. There was a real process
of self-exploration and trying to figure out what was the right authentic path for me career-wise.
And I did an awful lot of things that I recommend folks should do. But the number one important
thing was this aptitude test, which I'll mention in just a second. But the reason why I did this
is I think is the universal that I think many people wrestle with, which is this sort of like,
sadly, because I think our education system doesn't do a good job of teaching to the individual
and helping us identify sort of what our true path in life is. People have a lot of trouble
growing up answering the question, what should I do with my life? And then as we get older,
we find ourselves sort of trapped in whatever path that fate put us on. And a lot of people say,
geez, is this really it? This is not what I would have picked if I could do a do over here.
In fact, the research is really clear on this. It's like 80% of people would actively
change their profession if they felt they could. But most people feel at some point pretty stuck,
because once you're far enough into it, it's all you know how to do. You have a mortgage,
you've got a family, you feel like the cost of switching is just too risky.
And oftentimes what happens too is we just don't know what to do. And as a result, we find ourselves
just kind of reacting to life. And there's this great quote from Carl Jung that says,
if you feel like you're just kind of stuck in life, he says, until you make the unconscious
conscious, it will rule your life, and you will call it fate. And so when you hear people talk
about like, oh, my God, this always happens to me, or I can never catch a break on this,
it's largely due to these patterns in life that are there because of behavior choices that we're
making consciously or maybe unconsciously or decisions that we made in the past.
And if you don't really try to get to the heart of why these issues keep cropping up in your life,
you're going to be doomed to serve like Carl Jung, which is you're just going to call it fate and say
the universe hates you. But it's actually something you could change. You have agency to change. You
just have to identify what the problem is first. So anyways, as I was stuck in my corporate career
path, and no matter what job I was in, it just wasn't feeding my soul. And my pattern was,
man, I just don't feel like my job is important to the world the way that I want it to be.
And if you looked at my resume, you would say, hey, this guy's doing really well. He worked for
these big companies. He's got this MBA from Stanford. He's now at the end of VP at Yahoo.
But I was really pretty at the end desperately unhappy in all of this. And as I was trying to
figure out what I could do differently, one of my big blockers I realized as I was peeling back
the onion and all these things was that I was afraid that whatever my authentic path was going
to be was that it was going to be, quote, too small. It would be something that other people
would look at and say, that doesn't seem like an impressive job. That's not being a senior executive
of a massive Fortune 500 company. And I had to unprogram myself to say, hey, but that doesn't
really matter when I really think about what's important to me. I don't care at the end of the
day what people might think. And one of the things that really helped me take the leap that I did
was something that I heard from a friend who was a psychiatrist, which they said, hey, look, part
of the natural maturation process of a human mind is to make the transition from living a life based
on others' expectations of you to living a life based on your own expectations of yourself.
And this is where you get to put down all the pressures of what society is telling you is
important, or your family is telling you, your parents are telling you is important, or your
peer group is telling you important, where you just get to say, well, forget about that for
a minute. What do I find important? It might be very different, but at the end of the day,
it's not their life. It's mine. And so anyways, that all plus a whole bunch of additional work
finally gave me the confidence to leave that, quote, unquote, really good job and jump into
something that was totally brand new, totally unknown, totally unproven. And I never would have
made that jump if I hadn't have done all the advanced work to give myself confidence that
what I was about to do, which was to start this brand new company, it was back in the day, it was
called Peak Prosperity. It would have felt crazy to me, except that when I mapped out all the things
that my strengths, my goals, what I was hoping to get out of life, this highly risky, uncertain
thing actually fit it way better than the other options that I had at the time. So anyways,
of all the things I did, all the exact coach I worked with, all the exercises I did,
all the tests I took was this one called the Johnson O'Connor aptitudes test. And there's
a quick backstory to this, and I'll just take 60 seconds for it, but is back in the day,
a hundred years ago, GE would hire college graduates. And this was back when a lot fewer
people went to college. And if they hired you, you'd pretty much work at GE your whole career.
And what they realized is that everybody's different. And that Lance has some personal
superpowers that are different from Adams. So they're like, if we could figure out each
employee's personal superpowers, we could design a career trajectory within the company for them,
where they're going to be playing to their natural abilities. And so they're going to be happy
because they're succeeding, they're getting rewarded for it. And we're going to be happy
because we're getting their best work out of them. Everybody agreed this was a really smart strategy.
What they needed was a test to figure out what people's personal superpowers were. So they hired
this researcher called Johnson O'Connor, and he created this aptitudes test and lo and behold,
it actually worked really, really well. So GE very kindly actually spun it out as a nonprofit,
and it's been running ever since. So it's like a statistician's
fantasy. It's been running for over 100 years, more than a million people have taken it.
So it's just tons of data. And what they found is that all the things they test for, they correlate
for success in these different types of careers and these different types of work. And really,
the value for taking the test is not so much that it says, "All right, Lance, your superpowers are
X and you should do this job." And the computer will spit that out for you if you want to just
look at the base information. But it's more like, Lance, these are the things that you are just
wired to do. And if you want to have a job that's fulfilling to you, it has to have these elements
in it, or God forbid you don't have them in your job, you've got to have them somewhere in your
life or else you're just going to feel totally unfulfilled in life. And it's six hours of
testing. It's not a quick test. They test probably 50 different variables, half the time you have no
idea what they're testing. But again, each one of those things is statistically correlated over
the past century with these different types of abilities and aptitudes. And so if you can't do
anything else, I'd highly recommend folks consider taking this test. It's not cheap. It's probably
like 800 bucks or so. You can't take it online. You have to go into a testing center and they have
testing centers, I think, in like 14 of the major cities around the US. They don't have
any internationally to my point of view. So anyways, long story short, I had my daughter
go through this relatively recently because she is now going off to college. The data is really
clear. If you take this test before you go to college, your likelihood of switching majors
drops by 70% because you're making such a better fit decision right out of the gate. So anyways,
that test combined with a really good career coach to help me think through everything was just
transformative for me in being able to decide the jettison, the old world and start the new
path that I'm on. And of course, that has ended with more trial and iteration with thoughtful
money, which is where I feel like I'm kind of doing the work. I finally found where I was,
my place in the universe in terms of what I'm supposed to be doing. And I attribute that,
a lot of that to that Johnson O'Connor aptitude test. So anyways, I'll take a beat here, Lance,
but I know that you've gone through a similar journey in your life in terms of finding your way
to something that you feel like is a really good fit for you. So I'd love your thoughts on the
process. But also too, just because so many folks have been reaching out to me, I have reached out
to the Johnson O'Connor folks and just said, "Hey, seems to be a fair amount of interest amongst this
audience in your test." I could ask them if they want me to put on a webinar just to have
interested folks learn more about that. He said, "We'll do that at the drop of a hat thing." But
if there is interest in thoughtful money doing sort of a special one-off webinar with the Johnson
O'Connor folks about this, so you can learn more about this test, let me know in the comments
section. If there's enough interest, I'll happily put this together because obviously, as you can
tell, I believe a lot in it. But anyways, Lance, any thought about this process? Well, no. I think
everything is... Any tool that you can use to help you figure out where you want to go is great.
We teach all of our kids that they have to do certain things that we tell them, "Oh,
you got to go to college and you got to do this." And I met this. So we're remodeling our house
right now. And so my wife wanted some cabinets built. And so she's been looking around. She
found a cabinet builder here in Houston that she really likes. And he showed up at the house to
meet with her. And he's got earrings and he's got a long beard and green hair. And his name is
Chandler. But this guy dropped out of high school and... Sorry, he graduated high school, didn't go
to college. And he just loved working with his hands and he loves building cabinets. And this
guy is an awesome... We went and saw his work and he has a big portfolio of stuff that he's done.
And he just does phenomenal work. He works by himself and he's completely happy. And he's got
his life the way he wants. He's very successful in what he's doing. But people are gonna look at him
and go, "Well, you didn't go to college and you don't have this corner office job." So who cares?
He's happy. He loves working with his hands. He loves crafting and wood and doing those things.
And that makes him completely happy. And there's nothing wrong with that. So whatever it is you're
passionate about, don't worry about what other people think or say or whatever. Do what makes
you happy. I do what I do because I love what I do. I would do it for free if I could figure out
how to pay bills and do it for free. But I love what I do. And that's why I spend so much time
doing it. I think that's the real key defining factor is that if you're waking up... I never
wake up in the morning and go, "Oh crap, I gotta go to work." I get up in the morning, I'm excited
to go to work. I love going to work. I love doing what I do. And I think that's where you've got to
figure it out is that no matter how you get there... And look, I went through a lot of trial
and errors like everybody else and had failures along the way. And the big difference is that when
I had a failure, I didn't quit and just stop trying. And you've got to get back up and try
again until you find it and whatever it is. And I think that's the important lessons. And if you
can have a tool along the way that helps you narrow that path or shorten that path to finding
is what you're good at, what you want to do, that's awesome. So I talked a lot about the
centenarian advice, the advice that the people who live to be 100 give,
and it comes down to those three things. It's relationships, it's health, and it's purpose.
And you and I talked a lot about in these rants about relationships and health.
But a lot of people are like, "Yeah, the purpose one. Yeah, I totally want that. But how do I
really find out what my purpose is?" And that's what I really like about the structured
approach that I took going from being very unhappy to finding I think my true path is.
But the reason why I'm highlighting this Johnson O'Connor test is because that's a big part of that.
That's a big catalyst in that process. If you don't know, this is one of those things that just
pulls the data out of you and gives you data that you can use to start making decisions with on that
really key purpose side of things. And what's crazy is by the time you've graduated high school,
you've had over 13,000 hours in a classroom. For most people, not even an hour of that time
was sitting down with them to say, "Hey, Lance, let's map how you've been performing so far,
your interests, your life goals, and whatever to work that's out there in the world."
We just throw like 13,000 hours of information at you and then we just expect at some point,
the clouds are going to magically part, the shaft of light is going to come down. You're going to
have this epiphany of what you're supposed to do with your life. So we really don't help people
with the processing part of how do I take this information and map it to what I want to do in
the world. So again, to your point, I'm a huge fan of anything that helps people get through all that.
This last thing is that you'll never find your purpose if you don't try.
So regardless of test or not, whatever it is that interests you,
you've got to go try it and it may work, it may fail, you may find out you suck at it and that's
okay, but you'll never find out if you don't try something. Well, absolutely. And also on the other
side of that, I want to manage expectations. There's no magic silver bullets in life,
including this test. You're not going to take the test and it's not going to solve all your problems.
But what this type of data and this type of work will help you do is get you into a much closer
neighborhood of where you should be than where you are right now. And to your point, through
additional experimentation, testing, trying it out, you'll be able to course correct and iterate
to get to where you should be. But it's assets like this that hopefully, again,
get you a lot closer to the goal so that your own testing after that, which is zero in on exactly
where you should be. Well, look, another great week, folks. Even more than the
Johnson O'Connor test, if your purpose in life is defined by listening to these weekly market
recaps with Lance, let him know by hitting the like button, then clicking on the red subscribe
button below, as well as that little bell icon right next to it. A reminder, say this
every week, but I think Lance and especially his advice from mom did a great job of this.
If you are trying to build your wealth over time, follow the time honored principles for
building wealth. For most people, that's not trying to pick stocks individually themselves,
cross their fingers in hopes that everything works out well in the end. It's coming up with a good
strategy, a structured plan, executing it well for most people watching this who have real lives,
families to focus on. Your best bet to that is by working with a good professional financial advisor,
particularly one I would add that takes into account all of the macro issues that Lance and I
talked about today that we talked about every week and that all the experts that appear on this
channel talk about with me. If you've got a good one who's doing that, great, stick with them. But
if you don't, or would like to get a second opinion from one who does, consider scheduling a free
consultation with the financial advisors that Thoughtful Money endorses, perhaps even Lance and
his team there at Real Investment Advice. To do that, just fill out the short form at
ThoughtfulMoney.com. It doesn't cost you anything. You're going to get personalized advice tailored
to your specific situation. There's no commitment to work with these guys. It's just a free public
service they offer to help as many people as possible. All right, Lance, as usual, I'm giving
you the last word, my friend. Well, let's see how Friday closes and then next week might be
interesting. It might not be. We'll find out. Okay, maybe, may not be, we'll find out, but no.
I look forward to seeing what trade you make next week depending upon what happens
between now and then. Lance, buddy, thanks so much for yet another great week. Everybody else,
thanks so much for watching.
