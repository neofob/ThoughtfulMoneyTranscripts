Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. Bond yields have come
down recently making November the best month for global bonds since 2008 and for US bonds since
1985. Is this the start of a recovery in the bond market which has been battered and bruised for the
past three years running or is this just a temporary reprieve? To find out we've got the good fortune to
hear from bond expert Alf Pecatiello of the Macro Compass. Alf, thanks so much for joining us today.
Hey Adam, such a pleasure and I'm very happy to be on your new channel. It looks awesome and I'm
very happy it's going well. Well, thank you. I'm so pleased that you could be one of the early minds
on this channel. Alf, a lot of questions these days about bonds so to have your expertise here
early on, a great privilege for all of us. You're also a good friend. It's just always fun to talk
to you and see you again. Thanks so much for making the time to talk to us all the way from Europe.
Alright, I got a lot to go through and not a ton of time because we're both capped here with hard
stops so let's dive right into it. What's your current assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
I think we are in the phase of transition where people understand that inflation is going down.
They think it is going down to the Federal Reserve target to two percent. I think they will be
surprised that not only inflation goes down to two but it goes below two percent and that will mean
that central banks not only will cut trades but they will probably be even more aggressive than
what the market is already pricing in and at the first phase of this transition from "oh my god,
this time is different. Inflation is sticky. It will never go away." That was 2022. When you make
this transition into "oh, inflation is going to two" and the next step will be "oh, inflation is actually
going to be one percent at some point next year." At the early innings of this transition, people love it
because the uncertainty out there in market gets taken away at them. I mean, inflation is going
down. The central bank is going to be predictable. They are going to cut trades and all the negativity
is going to be basically taken away and companies that are under trouble will be rescued by
a pivot from the Federal Reserve. That's the first inning of this transition and the vibes might
actually continue for a few months until everybody is really convinced that it's a soft landing with
inflation at one percent, growth one percent, the Fed cutting rates, everybody's happy.
I think there is a risk that the first phase morphs into excessive euphoria and therefore
it traps people into aggressive positioning and it surprises them with a potential recession in 2024
which I don't hear almost anybody talking about as a possibility anymore. It seems like that everybody,
their dog and their mother, believes that soft landing is the only way out. So my two most
important messages are inflation will not only slow down to two but below two percent and when it does,
there is actually a second potential leg of recessionary vibes that kicks in
which people will be completely ignoring and be completely unprepared for.
Okay, I talked to David Rosenberg a few weeks ago on this channel and it's a good company to be an
elf. I think he sees things similar to you. He said that he expects inflation to have a one handle
at some point in the second half of next year. Sounds like you think the same thing.
He also expects a recession and he said, "Of course, we're going to have a soft landing
because the soft landing is a milestone on the way to the hard landing."
It sounds like you're saying. Of course, we have to talk in probability terms and nobody is a
crystal ball and it's easy to say there will be a recession. It's much harder to say when,
how hard of a recession. So I want to put some context here, Adam, and Europe, for instance,
has been growing or not growing at 0% pretty much for the entire year. UK real GDP and European real
GDP has been pretty much 0% this year. So they're flirting with the recession. Same goes for Sweden.
All the European continent is actually in trouble, but the market isn't really preoccupied by it
because 0% growth with unemployment rate mildly higher doesn't really scare markets. I mean,
what markets get scared about is when people are seriously losing their jobs, companies are laying
off, people can't spend, and there is a negative vicious loop that actually feeds into more
unemployment, less growth. That's what markets are scared about. So we need to talk about the
US specifically in this case. What are the chances that we're going to have a recession? How bad can
it be and when could it hit? And then we need to talk about this in the context of what the market
is pricing because that is important. You need to surprise markets to really generate this vicious
sell off. And I think by the first quarter of next year, you'll be in the perfect position
where everybody has ridden this soft lending narrative. Everybody's happy. Everybody's in
the pool swimming. The room is very crowded with the soft lending narrative. And so it's pretty
easy to surprise markets negatively. I think the first quarter of next year might see this
confluence. Okay. So presumably you feel that the financial markets, let's say equities,
might do actually pretty well for the next couple of months as everybody starts rejoicing, right?
Oh, soft landing. We're seeing the data. Inflation has come down to the Fed's target. Oh, it's going
a little bit below. Oh, wow. We may go back to the happy salad days of Fed cutting and doing
quantitative easing. Everyone's super excited. How does that start morphing in your mind to the
dawning realization of, "Oh gosh, this is actually
economy is not just hitting the soft landing, but it's continuing to go down and oh my gosh,
maybe recession is hitting now." Especially if it considers there's thinking that the Fed is going to
revert back to easing and bringing rates down, maybe it's not going to be worried for a little
while. Maybe it's going to think, "The Fed's going to ride to the rescue here." Now, of course,
anybody who looks at a chart of previous recession sees that they've all followed the Fed
aggressively hiking, then it hangs out in a plateau, and then as the Fed is cutting,
the economy is falling into recession all along the way initially.
Yeah. So look, I think, Adam, the key chart that I want to show people to start with here
is a chart of why I believe inflation might actually be 1% somewhere in the middle of next
year. And this chart that you can see here basically looks at the credit impulse on the
left side of the chart and what happens to inflation 18 months later. So this chart-
Sorry to interrupt, but if you could just define the credit impulse for folks that don't understand
what it is, it's basically the increase of the increase in credit, correct?
Yes. So what we're trying to measure here is the amount of real economy spendable money,
so the amount of money that ends up in our pockets and in the corporate sector, the amount of money
that gets spent in the real economy, in other words, and we're trying to measure whether it's
increasing or decreasing rapidly. So the rate of change of real economy money creation, that's what
we're trying to measure. It's a very powerful metric because the idea is if you look at this
metric in 2020, 2021, it went up very rapidly. And why? Governments from all over the world and banks
from all over the world sponsored by governments were providing cheap money to the real economy.
There was fiscal deficits. There was credit, which was sponsored by governments.
In case losses would occur, the governments would take up some of the losses from banks.
So there was a huge credit injection into the world. And 18 months later,
remember the power of this indicator is that it leads inflationary dynamics with 18 months.
The idea is you print more money, the money goes into the real economy, it gets spent and later on
as demand picks up, inflation finally shows up, right? And it did because 18 months later,
inflation did show up. So you had this one and you have to recognize that if you print
real economy money, inflation will show up 18 months later. Now, the problem is that at this
point, you start hearing narratives of this time is different, inflation is sticky, it will always
be at 5, 7, 8%. The reality is that we stopped printing real economy money, Adam. The US did a
one-off gigantic amount of fiscal spending, $5 trillion in a year. Then it did way less.
Then it restarted again last year. The next year, it's likely to slow down again.
Private sector credit creation, mortgage applications are at the lowest since the 90s.
The private sector is not borrowing because interest rates are too high.
Small cap borrowing rates are almost 10%. So effectively, the private sector says,
I don't want more credit, I am going to stop asking for credit, asking for real economy
money to spend. And so you get this downside here. And very punctually, 18 months later,
you get inflation that starts to follow this downward path as well, because you stopped
printing money aggressively. Now, this orange line here, the credit impulse gives us a head start on
the next 18 months. So it allows us to look forward, in other words. And if I look at what
the model says it should happen by June 2024, it says that not only inflation is going to stop 2%,
but it's probably going to be below. 1 and 0 are actually a possibility. Now, this is headline
inflation. If you look at core inflation, that means you can expect core inflation to range
around 1 to 1.5%. Those are low levels below the Federal Reserve target. That's where you start.
And right now, the market is focusing on the positive note of it. The positive note is that
inflation will slow down and the Fed can cut rates. And because growth isn't collapsing yet,
everything is nice and dandy. That looks a lot like 2019. 2019, inflation slowed down to below 2%.
Power pivoted very aggressively early January 2019, ultimately ended up cutting rates in
summer of 2019 to try and accommodate the easing. The economy didn't really collapse.
Job growth was low. Earnings per share were 0% in 2019. But because we really didn't collapse
in growth terms and inflation ended up low and the Fed cut rates, the market was pretty happy
about it. And I think that's what we're living right now, Adam. This feeling that everything
is going to land very smoothly, inflation is going to go down, the Fed is going to cut rates,
and growth is going to hold. This is where we start. I don't think we end here, though.
Okay, yeah. And talking about ending, so I can imagine that I keep thinking about the end of
Raiders of the Lost Ark, right? When the Nazis open the Ark of the Covenant and they are talking
to God, they think, and everything looks great. And then all of a sudden, the angels morph into
the angels of death. And all of a sudden, they realize they got what they wanted. It just wasn't
what they were hoping for. And I feel like you think that's the kind of year that at least equity
investors may have next year, as they begin to realize, oh my gosh, yeah, we've gotten inflation
under control, but now we're kind of worried about deflation. On the flip side, it sounds like it
should be a really good year for bond investors, at least for sovereign bond investors like US
Treasury holders, because interest rates are highly tied to inflation expectations. If folks
stop expecting inflation, maybe start thinking of extremely low or even negative inflation rates,
wow, got to get me the safety of some of these treasuries. And they expect the Fed to be out
there now doing quantitative easing and back buying treasuries. It's historically been the
biggest buyer. It's been sitting out the past couple of years. We could expect treasuries to
do quite well. I remember the last time we talked, before we even had this credit impulse chart,
you were saying that when the Fed was forced to change, you expected it to be very aggressive,
like to go back to zerp, or at least go very aggressively in that direction.
Do you still feel that same way? Yes, I do. So the idea is that people
think the process works linearly. So they think that inflation went up. I didn't really go up
linearly, did it? It was pretty delicious on the way up. But people forget that and they say,
well, inflation went up and now inflation is going to go down very predictably and linearly,
and it's all going to stop at 2% and everybody's going to be happy.
The problem is when you apply rapid changes to such a complex system like our monetary system,
things are hardly linear, Adam. So when you shake that system with a lot of money printing,
a lot of money unprinting, which is basically what we have been doing now for a while,
in my opinion, the risk of convex non-linear reactions are pretty high.
And so when you look at bond markets today, you can split bond yields in a few ways to understand
how they work and what level of bond yields you can reach at some point. And so two useful ways
of splitting 10-year treasury yields, for example, you can think of them as 10-year real interest
rates plus 10-year inflation expectations. So that's one way. You take a nominal yield
and you divide it into a real yield and an inflation expectation component.
Okay, so today 10-year interest rates are about 4%, a bit higher, 420, something along these
lines. And the way that this is split is that inflation expectation are about 225 and real
interest rates are about 2%. That is the split today. When you look at next year, what happens?
Well, if I'm right on inflation, then not only inflation expectations will be at 2%, but probably
even a little bit below that, okay? So on the yield perspective, you get a bit of tailwinds,
if you're long bonds, by the fact that inflation comes down. But most importantly, real yields
today are at 2%. 2% real yields means that the market is expecting the Federal Reserve
to keep real Fed funds positive effectively for the next 10 years.
Now, positive real Fed funds is a restrictive stance from the Federal Reserve. It means they're
keeping Fed funds above the level of inflation consistently for the next 10 years. This is very
different from what we saw from prior to pandemic levels when inflation was very low. The Federal
Reserve was trying to stimulate every time this inflationary process. And people now think that
despite the fact that inflation will come down, the Federal Reserve will keep real interest rates
markedly positive for the next 10 years. So it takes just a bit of this change where people say,
well, you know what? 2% real yields. Can the economy really take it? Because inflation is
tanking. Growth is coming down. Maybe we should reassess the fact that this is not very different
from before the pandemic. That maybe the US economy can handle 0.5%, maybe 1% real yields,
but that's it. So then you get a double whammy your way. Real yields come down. There is basically a
reassessment of where real yields should be, and inflation expectations also come down.
The combination of the two can easily be worth another 100 basis points. So from 4%, all of a
sudden you can be a tree. And the most important part of it all is who are the whales that are
going to come and buy bonds? And this is something I would like to explain to people because
I've worked in the bond market as a professional for a bank. And when I hear people on Twitter or
on YouTube or on any other social media discussing big buyers of bond markets, it always comes up to
two guys. The Federal Reserve is considered to be a whale and let's say foreign central banks. So the
Chinese or the Japanese are seen to be the big whales of the bond market. And I want to show some
data, Adam, if you agree with me, that shows that the big whales in the bond markets are some
unsuspicious guys that are called pension funds, insurance companies, banks, and asset managers.
These are huge whales that have been dormant for a couple of years, but they could come back in big,
big size in 2024, and we can explain why. Great. So banks and shadow banks, and this is exactly where
I was going to go with you, Alf, because if investors start thinking that today's tasty
yields are going to start going away and the bonds themselves are going to appreciate in price as
those yields come down, I want to lock those puppies in now. So it sounds like you're saying,
"Hey, these whales may step in and start buying kind of hand over fist while the time is right."
Yes, I think you're perfectly on the ball there, but most importantly, we should explain -- can I
share the screen for a second? So I want to share something that people should pay attention to,
I think. So this chart is key for macro in 2024. It shows the stock bond correlation,
which you can see here on this side of the axis, against the average level of core inflation. So
let me explain how this works, okay? If core inflation is above 3%, so we are going in this
area of the chart, the correlation between stocks and bonds is positive. And the big whales hate
this, Adam, because the big whales, like a pension fund, the pension fund has equities and risk assets
and credit spread and a lot of things because they need to generate returns so that they can pay the
future pensions, okay? They need to take risks. Now, why do they buy bonds? They buy bonds because
they want a negative correlation asset to their equities, right? They want equities to try and
generate returns and they want bonds as a safe stabilizer of their portfolio. So they want the
negative correlation here. Problem is that when core inflation is above 3%, historically, and this
chart looks at 200 years of history, you end up with a positive correlation like in 2022. So bonds
go down, equities go down, credits go down, everything goes down and these whales are basically
unable to buy more bonds because their entire portfolio is going down. So they stay away and
they say sorry, this is a bad period, I can't do much. But now, if core inflation goes below 3%,
that's where we are now. Remember, core inflation is going fast there. I say it's going to one,
okay? That's very low. But let's say it goes to two. What happens? Look at all these points,
your correlation becomes negative. And so that becomes amazing for these pension funds because
they can have the equity position in their portfolios and they can say what? I have 10-year
treasuries at 4%. That's a very respectable yield to buy for my future pensions to pay. And on top
of it, because core inflation is low, the negative correlation between bonds and stocks will come
back. So bonds will be irresistible as an asset for these whales because not only they have high yields
attached to them, they also fulfill this diversification property for their portfolio,
which is so, so important. So if we are really going here Adam, with core inflation persistently
below 3%, around 2%, and even in my opinion at 1%, you'll have insurance companies, pension funds,
banks, asset managers, the big, big bond market whales. They will be coming in in size. And do
you want to know the size? The size can be gigantic. This is a chart from Goldman Sachs.
So Goldman Sachs looked at the amount of net buying or net selling in the treasury market
from the 70s until today. It basically looks at all the flows that are going through the treasury
market and it measures where are they coming from? Who are the whales? Who are the biggest buyers of
the bond market? And so I would like people to pay attention to the Federal Reserve up here.
That's the light blue share. 14%, 6%, 14%, 7%, 15%. That's not a whale. That's a buyer of bonds.
Fair enough, but it is not a whale. 2020, 2021, the Federal Reserve bought 56%. That's a whale,
but that is a very concentrated quantitative easing time, right? That was the Fed doing QE
to help the treasury with their big fiscal deficit issuance, okay? If you go 50 years back,
the Federal Reserve has accounted roughly for 15%. Do you want to know who are the whales?
Look no further than my red boxes in here. Pension funds, mutual funds, and other asset managers,
foreign investors, which of course also include China and Japan, but this is mostly
foreign pension funds, foreign asset managers. These are the big, big whales in the bond market.
They account historically for 70% of the flows in the bond market. And recently, Adam, they have
been dormant. Look at them. They haven't really participated recently. They've stayed away exactly
because of this positive correlation, because they couldn't really afford buying more bonds
if bonds were going down, equities were going down. They were taking a hit from anywhere in
markets, but hey, if you get this negative correlation back, the whales will be back
next year in bond market. This is fascinating. So on this chart here, yeah, when we were in
the red zone, when inflation was above 4%, they couldn't diversify away their risk.
So it was game off for bonds. So if you can go back to the other chart of your red boxes there,
the big buyers, you said basically went game off. Well, now they're going to flip to game on,
but think about this too. Consumers, they're not quite as smart as the institutional guys,
but they're not dumb. They're going to say, "Hey, you know what? We've been buying a lot of
these bonds because we're getting much better yields than we were getting from our bank
accounts, but yeah, maybe this game is going to be over soon, so I still want to lock in this stuff
while it's there." So they're probably going to keep buying and then to your point, if the Fed is
now getting involved because it's now beginning to worry about a recession, then the Fed becomes
another buyer. It becomes basically game on for everybody. So not only you get the big, big whales,
but the problem is who's the marginal seller right here? Because households, which locked in in 2022,
2023, households were the whales. They were the guys looking at these yields, four or five percent,
and they said, "Yeah, give it to me, man. Well done, by the way, guys, because on average,
you have locked in good rates. You are the blue line over here, okay? So maybe you haven't bought
30 years treasuries, but you have bought from 10 bonds and locked in good rates." But at some point,
if you see that inflation is going down next year and if you see that things are normalizing
and you even start wondering, "Yeah, maybe we might fall into a recession," you are not going
to sell your bonds. So it starts to become really a very concentrated market where the negative
correlation between stock and bonds starts to exist again. It attracts the big whales,
but where are the sellers of bonds? That's my question. Once inflation starts consistently
going below 2%, Adam, I think it becomes a rush to an asset class which has gone down a lot for
two years in a row, almost three years in a row, starts to get a bit hated, but the reality is that
the whales will be coming back next year, so you should pay attention. So let me get your reaction
to this. So there's a narrative right now that there's an oversupply issue
in the US treasury market where Janet Yellen treasury is just issuing them galore
and foreign buyers, most often mentioned, but are less interested.
It sounds like you don't certainly think that's going to be the case next year. I'd be
curious if you think it's even the case now, but it sounds like what I hear from you is, "Yeah, we're
going to have a supply issue next year," but folks can't get them. There is no marginal seller.
I think that's what's going to happen because everybody looks at the supply,
but nobody looks at the demand for bonds. So everybody can say the treasury is issuing more.
Yeah, sure. You just go on the treasury website and you look at the size of the issuance. Ask
yourself who's interested to buy bonds. And now I showed you a chart that says that the biggest whale
which represents 70% of the purchase power in bond markets might actually have a very strong interest
in buying bonds next year. And the bond market this year has managed to close the year, it's not
closed yet, but almost, about flat, despite some big, big issuance at this company market. Remember
August, September, October, all this narrative. The bond market is about to close the year flat
and the whales haven't shown up yet. So my point to you is you're wondering about supply next year.
I'm wondering about demand because if the chart I showed you before with the negative correlation
actually kicks in, then I can guarantee that the whales will be coming back. So supply is always
easy to talk about. You can always say, "This is the number. This is the trillion in deficits. This
is the supply coming." Sure, that's true, but ask yourself where is the demand going to come from
and next year I can make a couple of points by which the whales will be showing up again and that
demand can be really, really powerful. Well, and I wonder if the worm hasn't turned yet and we just
haven't gotten the memo because of that point you just mentioned, which is for most of this year on
my interviews, I've been pointing out the fact that we were highly likely looking like we were
going to have a third down year for the treasury bond market, which would have been historically
unprecedented. Never happened since the 1700s and I think up until a couple of weeks ago,
it was taken pretty much as a given for this year. Now, because of the fact that yields have come
down, we're now, as you said, we're pretty much back to flat kind of heading green for the year.
So we may not get that unprecedented third year and as you said, the whales and all the other
buying stuff that we just talked about, that hasn't happened yet. That shoe hasn't dropped
yet and that obviously would put rocket fuel on the upward trajectory here for bond prices.
So I don't know. Maybe despite the dominant narrative right now of too many treasuries
out there and this could be another bad year for bonds next year because this year was the third
bad year, that's fast dissipating. Well, first, I'm not sure this year is the third bad year.
As you say, we are closing the year indeed at the moment pretty much flat on bonds,
so it's not too bad to be honest, and next year it's actually shaping up to be possibly a very
good year. Let's make another split of 10-year treasury yield. So I said before, we're at 425 now.
I can easily see us being at 3% somewhere next year. So that's a lot of yield drop and as you
know, yields are inversely related to prices. That means bond prices will be going up if I am correct.
But the other way to split it is you can think of a 10-year treasury yield as all the future
Fed funds over the next 10 years. So we start now at 525%, but what will be the Fed funds at the end
of next year and then at the end of year two and then at the end of year three and so on and so
forth. So you can think of decomposing them like this and then you can think of term premium and
term premium is a scary word. People are like, sometimes they hear this thing term premium. What
the hell is that? And so I want to explain why if you also do this decomposition, you end up to
possibly the same answer. 10-year treasury yields might as well go to 3%.
So if you bear with me for a second, I would like to share again a couple of charts with your
audience. So look, here is the number of cuts priced by December 2025. That's the orange line
here. And it's basically cuts over the next two years, okay, between today and the end of December
2025. And we are going fast to 200 basis point of interest rate cuts priced in the next two years,
okay? So the Fed is priced to cut from 525 to 325 in the next two years. That still sees no
recession, Adam. Let's make that clear because if there is a recession, the Federal Reserve will cut
actually 300 basis point in one year, not two years. So in two years, we'll be fast at zero.
So this doesn't assume a recession. This assumes a soft landing, yeah?
And sorry, just to interject for one second, if you look at the current dot plot offered
by the Federal Reserve, it projects this very graceful decline over the next five years. I'm
not sure what it is exactly in the last one, but one of the most recent ones I saw, it was like
down to 2.6% or so by five years from now. And you're basically saying a lot of reasons to expect
we could get down a heck of a lot further, a heck of a lot faster, and that wouldn't be a surprise
to guys like you who follow the Fed for many years because the Fed projections are notoriously wrong.
October 2007, they told me that growth in 2008 will be plus two and a half percent.
Sure, we all know how 2008 turned out to be. Not really two and a half percent growth,
unfortunately. And more recently, everybody remembers how transitory inflation was going
to be when they were-- Look, Adam, I don't listen to Fed predictions that much, but this is bond
market pricing over here, right? And bond market is saying, look, 200 basis point of pricing. You
can already see here as 10-year Treasury yields in blue pretty much follow the pricing of Federal
Reserve cuts, right? So as I said before, you can think of 10-year Treasury yields as the Fed funds
that will be prevailing at year one, year two, year three, year four. So if the market starts
pricing in cuts, obviously 10-year Treasury yields will converge to that. And if you price 200 basis
point of cuts, which again has nothing to do with the recession, it's just soft lending these
inflationary cuts, you can already see 10-year Treasuries at 380, 375%. This is the relationship.
Now, the other component to consider is term premium. Term premium measures the uncertainty
around this path. So if you buy 10-year Treasuries, what you are getting exposure
to is interest rate risk. So if interest rates move higher, the duration risk that is in a
10-year bond, in a third-year bond is pretty high. For a change of interest rates of 10 basis point,
the price move, in other words, of a 10-year or a third-year bond is very large. So the duration
risk, the interest rate risk is large. So what you want as an investor instead, it's not all
this volatility, you want a predictable stream of cash flows. As a retired guy, you want to buy
10-year Treasuries at 5%, you want no volatility around it, ideally, right? And you want your
coupons clipped in every year, every year, every year, every year, in a predictable fashion.
If price swings around a lot, you will demand some compensation for it, right? For all this
volatility and this compensation is term premium, okay? So as you can see in October, term premium
skyrocketed higher. Why? This time is different. Something is changing. There is so much supply
of bonds. Nobody would buy them. And look at inflation. It is so sticky. Of course, I'm
mocking now because all of this turned out not to be true, but this was the narrative at that point.
So the term premium had gone higher, 10-year rates had gone higher as a result of all this
uncertainty that people wanted to be rewarded for. But now, what uncertainty are we talking
about, Adam? Inflation is going faster 2%. Growth is slowing down. The labor market is slowing down.
The Fed is going to cut. It all sounds pretty predictable, right? So people will be demanding
less compensation for this uncertainty. And here I put a green area that shows what the term
premium was on average between 2016 and even during '21, '22. Well, term premium was negative.
People don't want to be paid for any uncertainty because there has never been any uncertainty
really. Inflation was predictable and growth was low. And if we go back even partially into
this regime, 10-year treasury yields can drop another 50, 75 basis points. So 375 minus 50,
again, 3 to 325. That's the base case for me where 10-year treasury yields might go next year,
and this does not account for a recession. It does not account yet for a recession.
So 3, 325, you can see us getting there kind of under status quo scenarios.
You throw a recession in, obviously, though, in that those yields get even lower pretty faster.
That's true because if you get a recession, as we said, in a normal recession, the Federal Reserve
over the first 12 months cuts rates by about 250 to 300 basis points. And in a successive 12 months,
so in two years total, the Fed ends up cutting rates by at least 400 basis points. So that is
much faster of a cutting cycle than the one that is priced here. If you get a recession,
in other words, 10-year treasury yields go 2% or slightly below. So that's still a lot to go,
but even if you don't assume a recession, those 425% yields you're looking at today, or even
better, the 5% yields you were given in October are actually a very good thing to have in your
portfolio. And the whales might be looking at yields and correlations with the stock market
next year, and they might be thinking, "Whoa, if I didn't participate so far, it's time to be back.
It's time to buy bonds because not only I can lock in a 425% yield in my portfolio, but I can get
this diversification property again working for my portfolios next year." So whales are generally
slow, and that's the advantage that retail investors have. Thanks to channels like you,
they get good information, good analysis, and they can act relatively quickly. They don't have
to go to an investment committee of any sort, right? So if you think that whales are coming back,
why don't be this small fish that gets in a little bit earlier than the whales?
That's a great way to put it. That is one of the advantages in this story right now for us
little guys. We don't get that many advantages versus the big guys, but this is one. So Alf,
obviously, you are pretty optimistic about bond prices going forward. We've spent most of the
time talking about sovereign bonds here, specifically US treasuries, probably similar
dynamics in the corporate space, although you have corporate risk to factor in there,
and if a recession hits, that may hit some of these companies that issue private debt
or corporate debt. So I guess the question I want to ask you is your whole career has been
investing in bonds. How attractive is this moment in time versus what you've seen so far in your
career? Wow, that's a good question. Can you ask me that question a month ago? I would have said
it looks awesome. 5% guaranteed 10-year treasury yield is a good thing to have.
425 is still pretty attractive. For a 425% 10-year yield to turn out to be a bad investment,
the world needs to be materially, materially different than before the pandemic. So that means
organic growth much stronger than before the pandemic. But Adam, I don't see demographics
changing for the better. I actually see China losing hundreds of millions of workers over the
next decades. So their one-child policy is actually playing against them over the next
few decades. I see demographics everywhere else in the world not looking particularly good.
Productivity, we've been there a few times and it's like 1% a year. We've become a bit more
productive each year. That's okay. But unless you believe that artificial intelligence is going to
be this world-changing technology and it has to act immediately that way and quickly, you're not
going to get the tailwind there as well. So I really don't see why equilibrium interest rates
for developed economies should be higher. How can the European economy, how can the UK economy
have interest rates, equilibrium interest rates materially higher than prior to the pandemic?
I really don't see the point. So if you don't see that sea change really, then all of a sudden 425%
compared to the usual two and a half, maybe 3% yield you were given, it's still a relatively
attractive entry level, I would say. All right, good. You talked about how your thesis plays out
even in a world of no recession. For the reasons you mentioned at the beginning of the discussion,
sounds like you do expect a recession next year. Just curious, how gut feel or based on your
current calculations, how would you rate the recession you expect? Garden variety,
extra bad, extra mild? A really good question and I think that the answer is
garden variety is a good answer. I would expect that the labor market takes a hit,
which is worse than people expect. At the moment, people expect no hit.
They expect nothing, yeah. So anything would be more than they expect, yeah.
So I think, for example, saying stuff like unemployment rate might go up to 6%.
It's not a ridiculously high level, but 6% is a few people will be losing their jobs, okay?
And why do I say that? The hiking cycle so far has not impacted corporate America at all.
Actually, it has benefited corporate America on the net basis, which is ridiculous.
And why? Because corporate America locked in very cheap borrowing rates before the Fed hiked,
so they did so in 2019, 2020, 2021. They borrowed for 10 years, in other words,
at very low interest rates, which means their refinancing needs in 2022 and 2023 so far have
been very, very limited. The pass-through, in other words, of the Federal Reserve hiking cycle
has been slow for corporate America, but they've got the benefit of investing their cash at 5%.
So it's really funny. Basically, they've got some positive effect so far for some reason,
but if you wait long enough, and this is how the macro lags really work, there will be more debt
that comes to refinance, and that happens already in 2024. In Europe, really rapidly. In the US,
it keeps happening over time. Yeah, those corporates all of a sudden will need to
refinance their debt at much higher rates, and as the Fed cuts interest rates, their benefit on cash
investments dwindles. So they start getting the negative side of the tightening cycle,
which is what they should get in the first place. That was the intention. But because of the
structure of corporate America borrowing, it's taken a longer time. I think when it kicks in,
people will be surprised that these corporates, which by the way, don't wait until the last
moment, they make plans. They look at how much they need to refinance, and they will be like,
"Ooh." Maybe my pile of earnings, which isn't really increasing by the way, so it's like a
stable pie of earnings. Where do I allocate it? Well, now I have this amount of wages and this
amount of production costs, et cetera, and then next year, they need to add the big, big slice
to that pie, which is refinancing costs, servicing my debt. It becomes much more expensive. It takes
a larger portion of that pie, and the pie is always the same, so you got to cut somewhere,
Adam, and I think people will be surprised that companies will be saying, "I don't need all these
people. Maybe I can shed 10% of my workforce." Then 10% here, 10% there, 10% there, it starts to
sum up. Already now, you see that hires, private sector hires in the JOLTS report are coming back
down already to 2019 levels, and we aren't yet at the point where the refinancing starts to be felt.
That happens somewhere gradually in 2024, so I think people will be surprised by the fact that
the labor market can weaken more than they think today. Yeah, and there's so much that I think
is tied to the future of the labor market, housing being a really good example, where we have these
kind of frozen markets or markets that have sustained at levels much longer than people
thought, and I think for many of them, one of the key underlying reasons for that is that the
employment situation hasn't really changed that much, but if that really does start to change,
especially for the negative, like you might think, maybe it cracks open the pace of change and some
of these other things. All right, well, I'm going to start wrapping up here, Alf, just because we
both have our constraints here, but I can't let you go without asking you two things. One, you've
got a great free resource for folks that are -- not free resource, but a great resource for folks to
let them know about. Before we get there, though, real quick, I just want to ask you your market
outlook for next year, which I think we've captured the spirit of, where I think you think
the markets are going to have a pretty rough -- the equity markets are going to have a rough
time next year while the bond markets do well, but specifically, are there any other assets besides
sovereign debt right now that you think are good assets to be considering,
given how you think 2024 is going to play out? So I think for the next few months, there are
certain emerging markets which are still cheaply valued with very good stories behind, and I think
Poland is a very interesting case. Poland is a very productive country which now has a solid
government, new elections. So basically, my point is look beyond the United States. There are
opportunities that are somewhere else in markets that are still cheaply valued. And then the other
investment I would do -- and I know you start asking this question to your guests, so I'm going
to anticipate you there and answer this question already, because we always talk about money and
investments and finance and stuff, but there are things you can do to become a better investor and
a more efficient person in your life, and one of it would be to invest in your own communication
skills. So if I look at people in the job market, in general, negotiating with other people,
presenting, communication skills are highly underrated. People don't work on them. Both
when it comes to verbal communication and written communication, it will fast-track anything you do
in life, because an effective communication is the ability of delivering ideas that are in your
brain, and everybody has amazing ideas, but being able to package them and communicate them
effectively to people, it's a superpower. It's really a superpower, so I would invest in that.
That is fascinating, and you did correctly anticipate where I was going, so thank you.
And communication skills, I couldn't agree more, especially as a guy in media,
but to your point, a vision can be great, but if you can't get people to understand it and
get on the bandwagon, then it's just sort of stalled at the starting line. So I wasn't
expecting that one. I think it's a great one. So Alf, I gave a quick little hint,
but you have a bond course that you have packaged for today's retail investor, and given that you
just basically spent the past hour telling us that you think there's a great year up ahead for bonds,
tell people more about that course. Look, guys, the course works like this.
The bond market scares people away. It's full of jargon and full of technicalities, but I wanted
to end that for people so that people could really master this complicated market. So you can do that
by buying my bond market course. It's four hours of material. You can download slides,
you can buy it and then watch it at any time. It's really handy. And how do you do that? Well,
you go in the link that I think Adam will put somewhere below the YouTube in the description,
so it's easy to get. I will put it in the description
immediately below this video, folks. But most importantly, most importantly,
because you're listening to this awesome channel and you're staying with us for an hour,
I'm going to throw at you a very special discount. 20% off using the code Adam,
pretty easy. 20% off, but only if you are within the first 50 people to purchase the course. So
take advantage of the offer, use the link below, put the discount code Adam and buy the bond market
course. All right, great. Super timely. Thank you for giving my audience that additional discount,
Alf. Real quick before I let you go, in addition to the course, which everybody should go check out,
if people want to follow your regular work, where should they go?
So they can start from Substack. I have a free Substack that goes out about every two weeks
and they can go there and it's called the macro compass. So if you Google the macro compass
Substack, you'll find it and you can sign up and that's the best way to follow me.
If you want something a bit more timely than once every two weeks, you can go on Twitter
@macroalf is my handle. There expect some tweets and some rants about foreign butchering of Italian
cooking traditions. I get a bit upset about that, but I'm Italian after all,
so please excuse me for that. Well, as somebody who does follow your Twitter closely, yes,
folks, if you are either a fan of Neapolitan pizza or you're a fan of charts, especially
charts on what's going on in the bond market, that is a great resource. Alf, I can't thank you enough,
my friend. Hope we see you again soon. Well, all right. Well, now's the time in the program where
we bring in the lead partners from New Harbor Financial to react to what Alf just said. I also
want to spend a little bit of time with them talking about the interview with Felix Zulauf
that we just released this past weekend, right before this interview with Alf, because that
was a very important discussion as well. And then if there's anything else going on in the markets
or how they're allocating their portfolio, we'll quickly talk about that too. I'm joined as usual
by lead partners from New Harbor Financial, Mike Preston and John Loader. Gentlemen, it's great to
see you. Mike, why don't we start with you? Alf clearly says now is a great time, he believes,
to be getting into bonds. He thinks they're going to have a good year ahead of them. What were the
key things you took from the discussion? Hello, Adam. Nice to see you again. Thanks
for having us here. Alf talked about bonds. The one key takeaway that I took out of Alf's talk is
that he's bullish on bonds. The 10 year treasury note is around 4.25 right now after reaching a
high of 5% in October. And I'll tell you that October low is probably going to be a low that
sticks for a while in terms of the price of bonds and the high in yields. Long-term bonds really,
really got hit hard in this bear market. They lost over 50% from the high. In fact,
if you look at TLT and long-term bonds in general, TLT being the exchange traded fund that holds
long-term US bonds, they dropped more than stocks dropped in general back in the 2008,
2009 recession. So it was an absolute bloodbath. And the low that we saw in October probably is
going to stick for a while. And so that caused yields to go from about 5% to 4.25%. But Alf just
said in his talk that he thinks that yields could go to 2% on the 10 year in a recession. And indeed,
he sees a recession coming. Part of the reason he sees that is because refinancing costs are going
way up. Sure, there's people out there going from one overpriced home to another overpriced home,
and they're paying cash and that's keeping the housing market aloft. But as refinancing costs
start to eat away at the profitability of corporations, and it's going to happen,
it's also going to hurt refinancing the US debt. So the treasury is going to have to deal with that.
But the refinancing costs should be a catalyst or one of the many catalysts that cause a recession
either next year or the year after. I think it's coming sooner. It's been somewhat forced all this
year because of easing standards and rules on banks after the bank crisis, but should come next
year. And the 10 year probably hits 2% in that case. So that means that bonds are still a good
opportunity. So I don't really hear him saying they're a screaming buy like they were a couple
months ago, but they're a goodbye right here. I'm going to share a chart just to show you TLT,
a little bit of what we're talking about. I'm going to move this off the page. Here's a daily
chart of TLT. It hit this capitulation low, and it's been pretty much bound by this uptrend
channel. Getting a little bit overbought as it approached the 50 day moving average,
the other red line is a 200 day moving average, but it's been pretty contained.
It wouldn't be surprising to see TLT to come back to 90 or 92. Maybe that offers a good entry point
hedge for people that don't already own it. We actually hedged half of our position
right around here, 92. We brought in some premium. So our hedge on half of our position sits right
around this line, but longer term TLT probably goes to 110 to 140. I mean, if ALF is right,
we probably go even higher. The 10 year yield at 2% would put TLT back up here somewhere at 140.
So this is the weekly chart, but zooming in, it's probably got a little bit ahead of itself and can
consolidate a little bit. ALF talked a little bit about a few other things of which I'll mention
here. As well as bonds, he talked about emerging markets. Just a quick look at emerging markets.
If we look at the largest emerging market, broad emerging market ETF, and we look at a monthly
chart, it's gone nowhere since 2006. This is EEM. So it's had some highs and some lows, but
the valuation on these markets is very, very good with a Schiller price earnings ratio somewhere in
the teens. The S&P is closer to 35 to 40. He mentioned Poland as a specific example.
I'm not so sure about Poland in particular, but emerging markets being at very good valuations is
the main reason why most of our equities are in emerging markets. Our model is up to about 27%
stocks. 15% of that is in emerging markets. And we look at particular countries like
Brazil, India, and Mexico, all of which we have a position. We're also looking at Japan. We'll get
a little bit into that later. And we have a broad emerging market ETF. We also have hedges with out
of the money puts on the S&P so that if the whole market comes down, that we'll have some protection
there. But emerging markets, we absolutely agree. Lastly, Alf talked about investing in your own
communication skills. I think that's great advice. Investing in yourself, investing in your
relationships, that kind of thing makes sense. But that's what I took out of Felix's talk, bonds,
probably not a straight up move, but dollar cost averaging in if you're not already there. It makes
a lot of sense in emerging markets. I don't think I heard him say this, but I'm assuming that cash
is a big portion of what he's doing as well. And it's also a big portion of what we're doing. It's
our biggest position. And when you say cash, you mean largely cash equivalents like short-term US
treasury bills that you're getting a return on? Short-term US treasury bills, we've been extending
out a little bit up to about one year, but we're essentially 40% or so in treasury bills at present,
roughly, because you have to have some dry powder to do something different if we get some kind of
crash from here. Although, and maybe John or I will talk about this a little later, short-term
indicators say that a further pop is likely in equity markets. But you're getting paid 5% to
wait. So unless you're getting better than 5% and any other ideas, it doesn't make much sense not to
have some treasury bills. All right. Well, look, I want to dig a little bit deeper into this on the
bond side, because I want to compare and contrast Alf with a few other folks that have recently been
on this channel. But what I took away from Alf's outlook is he thinks that, I think he thinks that
things are going to be pretty darn good for bonds for all the reasons that you mentioned, but one
that you didn't, Mike, which I thought was a big part of his focus, which was, "Hey, look, the bond
whales are going to be stepping in this coming year," in his opinion, because he thinks that folks
are going to wake up to the fact that inflation is headed down towards the Fed target here. It is not
going to be the problem that it was in the past and that as folks begin to realize, "Okay, well,
as inflation expectations come down, then bond yields should come down," then I want to lock in
these tasty, relatively high measured by past couple of decades bond yields right now.
So you have all these big players that are all of a sudden going to start trying to scramble to the
market and say, "Hey, before yields go any lower, I want to try to lock them in in this four plus
world," because maybe the peak is in, maybe I missed the 5% tenure, but I'll still try to
lock it in at four and a quarter or whatever. So obviously, as those people come in and buy bonds,
that'll push up the price and therefore continue to bring down yields. And again,
that's not even including a recession. And then he says you get a recession in the mix,
as you just said, you think is more likely for next year than not, then it just becomes game on
in terms of how low yields can go. So I thought that that was really interesting. I want to
contrast that to, we've had some other people on the channel who aren't interested in touching
bonds. They're just saying, "Look, I think inflation is going to be stickier than folks
imagine. I think we're in a new secular era of higher interest rates." And they just think that
bonds are to be avoided at this point, particularly the long duration, short term
T-bills. Yeah, no problem, but going out in duration, that's a bad recipe.
And then you have folks like Felix Zulauf, and I'm going to want to talk with you guys a little bit
more about Felix's specific predictions, but he thinks that bond yields are going to come down,
but he's basically saying, "It's going to be messy enough that it's not really a main part
of his value play for next year." He's just like, "I'm going to leave that for more aggressive
people." But just to summarize what he thinks, he thinks that bond yields will continue to come down
to around 3.7-ish or so by the end of Q1, which is when he sees the stock market making a new high.
But then he sees the wheels start coming off, and he thinks that bond yields could go higher in the
short term, maybe to a new high for the year, or at least the past 12 months, get up to maybe the
5.5% range on the 10-year, and then head down to the 3% range by the end of the year as the markets
are correcting hard. He expects the S&P to go down 40% and recession to kick in. Now, the game
changes going into 2025 because that's when the central bank rescue efforts really start goosing
everything. But even though he got that general arc for the bond market, he's like, "I'm not really
going aggressively out on duration because there's just too much uncertainty, and I feel like I could
get really knocked off my trajectory there if it ends up following a different path, and I think
it's going to." So he's gingerly participating in it, if at all. So I'm curious, Mike, if you could
just give me your thoughts on what you guys at New Harbor generally think the arc for bonds are going
to be, and what are you doing with your portfolio on the longer end of the duration curve?
Yeah, Felix's talk was very good. And like you said, he's gingerly long bonds because he expects
perhaps a drop to 375. I just said that I agree with Alf that I think ultimately we deal with a
recession and maybe worse, and that during some kind of panic or deflationary scare, that bond
yields on the 10-year can go down to 2%. That means that I think that there's quite a bit more
upside, but Felix had a good point. He's like the bullish positioning in long-term bonds is a little
bit disconcerting, and it's something we're noticing as well. There's been no real capitulation,
there's a lot of bullishness still in that space, which is kind of surprising seeing that bonds have
fallen more than 50%. But we would agree with Felix that we're not married to this trade. This
is a trade, not a long-term investment. And I think that's essentially what he said. We're only
about 10%, maybe 12% in the long-term bond, so it's not a huge position. And we use options quite
a lot. We were surprised by how fast we fell into October, but we defrayed a good portion of that
with our hedges. We had in the money puts that we have since taken some profit on. So I believe that
if yields do what Felix said, and that is go down to 375, that we'll be able to play that pretty
well. Our plan is to keep this position on to have some options around that position so that we can
hopefully make some money on the options as well. But if the 10-year yield goes to 375, then I would
expect TLT, for instance, to get to the high 90s, maybe even 100. So there's some money to be made
there. Long-term, more than two years out, I don't think we want to be in long-term bonds because I
think the end game of all of this is a monetary panic where the Fed just responds to what is
likely a hard landing. Another thing that Felix said, we're probably going to see surprise. It's
not going to be some soft landing equilibrium where we just kind of all dance away into the
sunset. It's probably going to be some kind of crisis and shock. The ultimate response to that
is going to be, I think, money printing like we've never seen and inflation. We don't want to be in
bonds during that time. So maybe between now and a year and a half from now, I think that we can do
well riding the trend of long-term bonds, which is likely to be higher but messy. It will not be
a straight line, not a V-shape recovery. There's probably too much bullish positioning for that.
But I think with options and the way that we can hedge, we can ride that pretty well. So
modestly bullish, not going to be a straight line, and not forever. Probably not more than two years.
OK, great. Thanks. John, let me pull you in here. I'm curious. We just talked an awful lot about
both Alf and Felix. So I guess first, do you want to add into anything here that Mike said?
Yeah, I'll emphasize a couple of points. And Mike pointed out that our position in long-term bonds
is a fairly modest one, 10% to 15%. And that probably says in words everything you need to
know about our conviction in terms of how big an opportunity this is. I think one of the key
aspects of this debate, and both Alf and Felix and folks on both sides of the equation here,
have some very compelling arguments. I think one aspect here that we probably need to bring into
the fold is the last decade and the form of stimulus was really off the charts. And in some
ways, maybe we need to recalibrate ourselves a little bit. So for example, when the Federal
Reserve started QE, which basically is what gave rise to the steep decline in longer-term bonds,
because they were essentially printing money to go out and buy Treasury mortgage bonds,
leading into 2008, their balance sheet was $800 billion. After QE, it was over $4 trillion.
So we have a little different situation here in terms of the capacity of balance sheets and also
the just sheer amount of debt in the system. It's not perhaps so easy for an immediate return to
quantitative easing. In fact, I think there's a valid point to be said that if we do get a major
recession or worse, perhaps the form of stimulus is going to be more in the form of direct payments
to consumers rather than through this mechanism of the bond market. And that could actually be
quite inflationary. And I just want to share a couple of charts that put this in perspective.
So this is a long-term chart of the 10-year Treasury bond. Felix, for example, called for,
in the near term, maybe the 10-year to continue declining from 4.2, 4.25 to about 3.7. That's
like right around here. And if you go back-- so these low interest rates on long-term bonds has
really been mostly relegated to just this decade of QE. And in fact, if you go back to prior
recessions, not only have interest rates bottomed at or healthily above where we are right now,
there are actually periods like, for example, the '70s, where they actually rose, for example,
during this recessionary period, and here kind of chopped sideways. So this notion that
recession means automatically interest rates decline is a little bit too convenient, I think,
maybe anchored into the recent past. And then this next chart is one that
John Hussman put together. And this just simply shows--
And sorry, John, sorry to interrupt. But I think the reason why it's anchored
now is because of the central planner response. It's not that bond yields should rise in a
recession. It's that bond yields should fall in a recession. It's that they should fall
once the central planners respond to the recession. That's correct. And I guess it's
a valid debate as to how they may respond, whether it's through buying bonds again or getting monies
into-- let's not forget, we have stock valuations that are near record highs if you go back in all
of history, depending on how you look at it. That wasn't the case in 2009 when QE was launched,
technically, 2013. Different set of circumstances. But even looking at recessions, this is a chart
that John Hussman put together. It basically just shows that yields don't tend to drop
meaningfully until sometimes a year into a recession. So there's a lot of nuance here. And
that's really, I think, why we're kind of being very cautious about getting too overloaded on
these. And let's not forget that a month ago, we were talking about legitimate buyer strikes on
bonds. And so much so, the Treasury kind of wigged out and actually basically did a market favor and
said, hey, we're going to continue funding via short-term Treasury bills rather than longer-term
bonds because of perhaps some of the scare that was in the bond market. It's going to be really
interesting. I think Felix's kind of theory or path here with a very choppy up and down bond
market is probably a pretty good picture to be thinking about.
Yeah, and it's also too, it just underscores the folly of kind of investing according to the
headline du jour. They tend to present a picture of, oh my gosh, the world is for absolutely
certain heading in a certain direction. And then all of a sudden, a month or two later, it can turn
in a dime and what looked like a certainty is now the contrary position to take. I also just want to
note too that we've railed about this in the past, but the fact that so much of the investing
community is trying to figure out, okay, so if there's a recession, what are the central planners
going to do? That really forces you from being an investor who is looking at business cycles and the
fundamentals of the companies themselves and forces you to be a speculator about what is a
small group of humans around a table going to do and the fact that so much, the vast majority
probably of the investing community has been forced to become speculators for that exact reason
of the central banks really at the end of the day, they're directing the action. It's just a really
sad commentary on the state of our financial markets. You're sort of nodding grimly as I'm
saying this, John. Yeah, it's been a tragedy I think for all of us. Maybe we don't all realize
it yet but markets have been utterly corrupted, distorted by -- you take interest rates, the very
lifeblood of the capitalistic system and drive them to zero or even negative in many parts of
the world, you're going to get some pretty distorted and unhealthy things in the system and
I think we're still working through those and probably will be for many years to come.
Okay. All right. Let's just assume for a moment that Felix's
game book for next year proves correct. That is going to be a highly disruptive year.
I mean, we're talking first people probably getting to an elated state of new highs on
the S&P, S&P 5000 like you said and then just a total nose over and again, no guarantees on this
but assume for a moment that we do in the year at 3000 and so in three quarters, essentially,
the S&P loses 40% of its value and a big part of that is going to be weakness in the magnificent
seven which you talked about in terms of how they're over owned. So the collateral damage
of that is going to be tremendous because so much of the investing community is exposed to
those stocks. What would that world look like? I want to stick with you just for a second,
John, then we'll come to you, Mike. Sorry, in your answer, how would you guys plan to navigate it?
Yeah. Well, chaotic is, I think, one word but we've been here before, right? This isn't the
first kind of episode where we've had very extreme bubble valuations that seem like they are never
going to matter. Perhaps this time has been a bit more extended and we've seen episodes like this
before. In fact, I'm going to share another chart of John Hussman just because it's so good, I think
and this, I think, puts a lot of that into perspective. So this chart goes back to 1928
and let's take Felix's call for a 40% declineish off the top. Now, taken in a vacuum, it's easy to
say, hey, stocks could drop 40% but understand that there's precedent from when we get to
valuations like we're in right now. It's not, if there's one tragedy is this idea that markets are
a flip of a coin, that there's, you have no kind of basis on which to have a better ability to
predict big declines versus big, big, big rises. And in fact, when you look at big declines in
history, they come from the very set of overvaluations we have like right now.
It doesn't mean they come right away. In fact, they're oftentimes delayed. And that's what this
chart shows. This chart is a little complicated. I'll try and simplify it. This blue line is
basically the level, the valuation derived level of a decline in the S&P 500 that would be needed
to be historically consistent with a perspective return of let's say 10% in the S&P 500.
And this is John Hussman's model and it's basically based upon actual data, historical
data. And the red is the actual worst drawdown in a three-year period. You can see right here.
And you can see over history, it's going back to 1928, '29, virtually every situation ultimately
sees this projected decline needed to get back to kind of normal valuations. Ultimately, it gets
filled or has been filled historically speaking. Now, there are periods where this white space is
basically indicative of, hey, these valuations don't matter. The market's not going to sell off
because it doesn't matter anymore. And in fact, this latest episode has been more extreme and
extended than ever before. But it's a pretty big wager, we think, to be saying that means it
doesn't matter. In fact, we think it probably matters all the more. And combine that with the
real challenge that our clients have, it's not posting 10-year annual returns on some mutual fund
fact sheet. It's, hey, is my money going to be here to provide the kind of returns I need to
provide for my living? And I have a chart I can show you here. If we actually look at the timing
of returns, you take, for example, the 25-year period of if you had retired in 1973 and looked
at the actual returns over the next 25 years, that was a devastating period because the '73,
'74 was a very nasty two-year bear market. You simply reverse the sequence of those returns.
In other words, the 1997, 1996 are the first two years and 1974, 1973 are the last two years.
Dramatically different results in terms of how likely the nest egg is to be able to sustain
itself and provide a client what they need during their retirement. So that's really where this
really hits home for us and our clients. It's not about projecting returns just for the sake
of doing it. It's about, hey, can our clients-- is our nest egg going to be sufficient to provide
what they need when they need it? Yeah. So it definitely speaks to why sitting down with a
financial advisor and doing a financial plan and doing the scenario planning is so important. So
you can see where the vulnerabilities lie in terms of timing of when you make certain different
decisions. And folks, if you're watching and you haven't created a financial plan yet with
an advisor, or if it's been a couple of years, I highly recommend you do that as we get into the
end of the year and you're trying to hopefully start 2024 on a sound financial footing.
That chart from Hussman there is a scary one, John, because it basically says to Felix,
hey, I'll take your 40% decline and I'll raise you, because it seems to predict about maybe
a 2/3 decline based upon the current model. That's actually what that says. But John,
Hussman would also be the first one to say it. It doesn't mean a scenario where we don't get
down to those levels of sell-offs. It likely just means from a mathematical standpoint that the
subsequent returns are just not going to be that compelling. They're not going to be
10% annually. Maybe three or four is where we top out. That's really what that means.
Yeah. And we've shown the scatterplot from John often that shows the projected
12-year return in the S&P based upon today's current level evaluations. And that still is
negative. It's something like negative 4% or 5% per year for the next four years,
which could be a massive drawdown and then rebuilding from there. Or to your point,
it just could just be a slow grind down, just losing a couple of points a year for the next
12, which would be just pretty miserable for folks as prospects as well. So who knows if that's all
going to happen? Again, that's why we have you guys on this channel every week so that we can
be looking at the action as it is developing week to week and help audibly guide folks as to what's
going on. You guys will share your decision-making process for us. We got to start wrapping it up
here. Mike, anything else on your guys' end in terms of new positions you guys have taken or
plannings that you guys have with your portfolio heading into the end of the year here? And I guess
in your answer too, if you don't mind, is there anything you would recommend viewers do given the
fact that we are now just a couple of weeks from the end of the year here in terms of just tidying
up their finances for 2023? Well, I'll try to respond to that briefly. In terms of year-end
things, definitely want to look at gain loss situation. You can take a $3,000, which seems
ridiculously low by the way, a $3,000 maximum loss against income and unlimited amounts against
capital gains. So take a look at gain loss. We're certainly doing that here and are going to do our
best to net out to either no gain or a slight loss, so people don't have to worry about that.
But individuals should be doing that. Charitable giving makes sense as you enter at the end of the
year. You can give up to $100,000 directly out of an IRA if you're taking required minimum
distributions already. There's a whole bunch of other things as well. But those are really the
two big ones in terms of year-end stuff. Happy to talk to anybody that wants to chat about that.
I guess one other thing that we're very busy with right now I should mention is Roth conversions.
If you're in the low bracket, if you're a married filer earning less than 89,000 adjusted gross
income, that puts you in the 12% bracket. And so Roth conversions, if you're in the 12% bracket,
are almost a no-brainer up to that limit, up to that cap of roughly 89,000 for 2023,
and it's half that for single filers. So some people are in that situation. They may have low
income or they may have retired early but aren't taking social security yet. So it's a really
common conversation that we're having. If you're in that bracket now but it may be going up later,
think about doing that Roth conversion this year as we've got just a couple of weeks left.
Sorry, Mike. Just for the folks that might not know what you mean by Roth conversion,
can you just give a quick description of that?
Sure. A traditional IRA is funded with money that goes in pre-tax. That is, you get a
tax deduction for it. Or if it goes into a 401(k) at work, you don't get taxed on that money at all.
So that traditional IRA or 401(k) is all money that's never been taxed. When you ultimately
take it out and you have to start taking it out with required minimum distributions at age 73,
that age is ultimately going up. But roughly 73, when you take it out, it's taxable as ordinary
income at whatever tax bracket you're in. A Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) by comparison is money that's
post-tax and it never gets taxed. As long as it's been open five years,
all the principal and growth in the Roth IRA is completely tax-free.
Technically the principal is always tax-free, but the key is the growth in that Roth IRA is
completely tax-free for the rest of your life. You never have to take required minimum distributions
either, which is important to some people. So if it's important to you to never take required
minimum distributions and to leave a legacy, perhaps for the kids, if you live to age 100,
you don't even have ever have to touch that until they inherit it. So it's powerful. I mean,
I'm not that crazy about paying taxes now versus later, but if you're in the 12% bracket,
it's kind of a no brainer. So I wanted to put that out there. And if I could just close by saying one
or two things more about what Felix said, I'd love to do that. This is an environment that hurts
everybody. It's a very unsafe market. It's not a real market. It hasn't been for quite a long time
with quantitative easing. And we tend to agree with what Felix is seeing and that we probably
have a move higher here. All of our indicators have been lining up, pointing to the upside.
We hate to admit it, but that's what's going on. We reduced hedges and added a little bit to our
stocks because of it. So we're presently at 4,600 on the S&P. Felix says that maybe we go to 4,900
or 5,000, a new high ultimately dropped to 3,000, which is a big drop, 40%. And then double again
from there to 6,000. So what a sickening ride that is. And unfortunately that hurts everybody
because if we pop to new highs, it's going to suck even more money in through fear of missing
out or FOMO. And generally speaking, people won't sell. They'll sell perhaps down at the lows,
a lot of people, unfortunately, and then only to watch it double from there and jump back in.
The Fed has created this unstable market. It's really not good and it's going to hurt people.
And it's really a case for active management. We have increased our stocks a little bit,
like I said, but the real key is going to be getting in on the way down when we have a kind
of a layering system where we will add tactical positions at key points with hedges. We will not
be perfect. That's why we use options to kind of approximate our entries and it's a lot more
forgiving. And by the way, even if we do reach 3,000, there's nothing that says that we can't
lose another 50% from there down to 1,500. I'm not predicting it, but in fact, 1,500 would only
be a level that would yield maybe 10 to 12% expected returns on the S&P over the next decade.
That's how crazy it's gotten. So having that skill to get in, having the patience to get in,
having the options to hedge, I think will be important. Being an active investor will be
important. Ironically, it's the opposite of what worked in the last 10 to 15 years. All you had
to do is blindly hold and never sell, which has been very frustrating because we've been dealing
with a relatively permanently overvalued market all of these years. This time has been different
and that this set of conditions has persisted then longer than ever before. But it's for all
those reasons that I think that the ultimate trap is potentially here for people that are just
buy and hold investors. So active management, patience, layering in, those types of things,
I think will be important. Very well said, Mike. You're reminding me that maybe next time
when you guys are on next week, we could talk a little bit about the bullwhip effect
because I think it can help people understand why we're so concerned about sort of lag effects that
we haven't arrived yet and have taken a while to arrive. But when you pull liquidity in and out,
the way that the Fed has done here with its right-hiking regime, its historically unprecedented
right-hike regime after a historically unprecedented amount of stimulus coming to the
economy, I think it'll help folks really understand why we're so concerned about the scope of what
could be what really probably is very likely lying ahead of us because of the bullwhip effect, but
don't have time for that this week, so we'll have to save that for next. Alright, gents, we'll look
