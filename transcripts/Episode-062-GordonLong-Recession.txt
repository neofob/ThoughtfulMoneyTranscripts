Do I believe there's a recession coming?
Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. The economy's chugging along at a more robust GDP growth than many expected. Inflation's
low. Many, including Wall Street for certain, have bought into the soft landing or no landing at all narrative. We're in a Goldilocks era, they tell
us. Bears should just stop worrying, admit they've been wrong, and join the party. So is that truly the case? For answers, we turn to market analyst
Gordon Long of Matasi, Macro Analytics and Technical Analysis Strategic Investment Insight. Gordon, thanks so much for joining us.
Thank you for having me. Always enjoy these discussions.
I do too. And Gordon, you have become an audience favorite. So great to have you here on Thoughtful Money. Look, lots to talk about and you were very
kind to put together a number of slides, which we'll get to in just a moment about sort of how you see the world right now. Very quickly, though, if we
can just kick it off with a question I like to ask at the beginning of all of these interviews, which is what is your current assessment of the global
economy and financial markets?
Good question. Big question. Is that in 25 words or less?
Now take as many words as you want.
Okay. Actually, two parts to that. Global are the economy and markets and they're not the same answer because they are disconnected in a way that we
haven't had or have been increasingly going to in years. So go economics and markets, but let me start with the economy and that has actually two parts
globally and the US and they're different. Right now, some of the charts economically and if you really get into the details, the economy has never been
shakier with underlying issues associated, it all stems back to the level of debt, the ability to finance the debt, the sort of risk premiums that
are going into that should be in the debt, duration risk on the bond market, equity risk premiums on the equity side of the house. But having said that,
right now we're actually seeing an upturn, an upswing in the global economy and maybe even more so in the United States and that's coming because the
financial conditions index as an example have weakened so dramatically since last fall. And there is so much liquidity out there and by the way, we
need to talk about the stealth liquidity that's actually being put out into the market. So we've got this upswing. So from an economic standpoint, it
looks pretty good, likely being an election year and the amount of elections that are being run around the world, they're all going to push a little bit
of extra programs and push into the economy to get elected. We always see that. So on the surface, the economy should hold up fairly well through the
course of this year. Do I believe there's a recession coming? Absolutely. Do I believe it'll be a soft landing? Not at all. It's going to be a hard
landing. It's going to be longer getting to us than I originally thought personally. I will start to see movements of that unfolding of that recession
later in the fall and into next year. Don't get me wrong, that's because of the numbers. Actually, if you look at the unemployment numbers, they're
much worse than are being reported. The jobless claims this morning, they're almost a joke. The Bureau of Labour Statistics, even the Fed is
questioning their numbers in the FOMC. I don't want to get into that, just put it off to the side, but they can only cover that for so long before it
breaks into the open. That's why it'll drift and we'll really see it in the fall. But on the market side of it, we're right on a cusp of whether
it's going to break at any given time. I mean, with the liquidity, it says it should hold the market up. I guess the best way of describing it is
that market tops are a process and we're in something that is really, I believe, is generational. This is not this decade, though I think we're
going to be correcting the COVID and the run up we've had since 2008 through the process of a financial correction that's coming over the next few
years, what I call the beta drought decade, where we see more stagnation and then stagflation eventually as long, longer ways out. But, you know, it
takes a couple years to actually fill in that top and the dome top and double tops. That's kind of what we're in right now. But on the other, you
know, they always say that bottoms are an event, the tops are a process and it's dragging it out. So the markets itself, and just to comment on it,
there's so many things that could trigger, you know, whether it's a commercial real estate crisis with banking crisis, there are so many areas that
could trigger it at any time and have a fairly significant correction. But there's so much, you know, just wrap it up, there's so much momo and
fomo out there, momentum, and fear of missing out. And we've conditioned at least one generation, maybe two generations of buying the dips,
everybody's a gamma trader or a meme trader right now, it takes them a number of shocks to shake it out of the market. So I think we'll, you know, we
may see a break, a shock and break down. But it'll bounce back up as we work through it. But it'll finally be that recession that'll take us down a
little long window. But we can get into that in more detail.
All right, no, no, it's great. One of the things I love about you, Gordon, is you're very specific in terms of how you see the world here. This
progression you're laying out, you know, certainly has an understandable logic to it. And you've got some some gray in your hair there. You've
been through several market cycles of the course of your career. And before we turn the camera on here, you were talking about how, you know,
there was a lot of the gestalt of what you're experiencing right now feels very similar to how you felt back during the dot com bubble and its
successes in those later stages, right?
Exactly. Very self a deja vu. So what it what it what it feels like, it's never the same. The old expression, well, markets aren't but they
were at rhymes. We've got the same kinds of I think I sent a chart on the trifecta, we've got the same elements, breaking that we've seen before
and they haven't been, they've been at major events previously. There are so many charts that send signals, but there's only a few that
are multi decade or a decade long, that really give you good signals. They they never give you good timing on it. But it tells you, you know,
when you should start to take risk off the table. And we're in such a period right now.
Okay, well, that's getting to one of the punchlines I was gonna ask you're saying for the prudent concerned investor, you think this is a risk
off period time to take your chips off the table. So you mentioned your chance? Yeah,
talking if we're talking equities, absolutely. But there's, you know, there's a lot of markets here, we can talk about whether the bond or credit
market or the currency markets. And there's a time to be in each one of those in a time to rotate, I think the time to get out of the equity
market is now. But I think there's time to be in things such as the bond market and various elements of it.
Okay, great. Well, let's talk about all the markets. And to get there, you mentioned your charts, let's let's get to the charts that you
prepared for here, because I think that's a great segue in terms of sort of how you're seeing things here.
This is what I call the trifecta earlier is, and this is a log chart of the S&P. And what it's measuring is when we've had highs, when we're in a
trading ranges within 5% of a high, of an all time high, and when that comes and goes, and if you go through the charts, you can see in the orange
here when we have these, these periods, so we're at a really elevated highs. And, and we've been in it, if you look at the chart, 42% of the
time, we've been in that since, since 48. It's been a fantastic period of time for the, for the US economy. But if you, if you start to look at
the behavior, within it, you see these, these three boxes, we get back into the into the 70s, which, you know, I lived through that I was starting my
professional career at that point in time. The dot-com bubble and the financial crisis is both in that second box. And then where we are right
now, and you can see kind of a pattern in there too, between the first two and the possibility of in the third. Now, you know, what are patterns, but
what's, what's important is what's inside this pattern. And what we've got in each one of those is extreme narrowing in breadth. And in the, in
the seven and the 70s, it was the nifty 50s, for those that might recall it. And then in the, in the dot-com and the financial crisis, we got
into, you know, it was the, the major techs, the internet kind of companies, but it narrow, it narrowed down, it was, you know, we started to get
fewer and fewer. And now we're basically in the magnificent seven and down even into three and, and driven primarily by dominantly recently by
Nvidia, we have never seen the breadth narrower with fewer stocks carrying a dominant part of the market than ever before. And I'm not even talking
about the explosion in ETFs that are built, built into it. So there's this narrowing breadth, which is fine. That's what's consistent here of those
three areas, but also when that breadth starts to drive into a parabolic lift. And in every case, if you track the charts, you'll see they started to
move into a parabolic lift. So you, you've got that set of patterns, which is very, very unique, which is problematic in its nature, but that doesn't
mean the market's going to suddenly crash. But the other thing you see is obvious here is this double highs, and you get this one period, you get this
major sell off. And it's there over long periods of time, the second box there, the first, first top is 2000 with the.com. The second box, when we
came up and double tested, these are m tops or double tops, was really the financial crisis in 2008. And we went down. So, you know, they can be
longer, they can be shorter, but it's this retest, it's this getting rid of this buying on the dips, this mentality that gets built into the system
and you get these double highs, double tops, which effectively creates a dome, technically, and you get inside the dome. So we're starting to build, you
know, real unique consistencies in these things, unique, but consistent. And the third one, third part of this, which is really important is that the
second peak is, there's a, there's a recession with it. There is typically with the first one too, but not necessarily, maybe a little leading, but the
second, the second one really leads into a major, a major recession and drop. So when you put them all together, all it says is there's a very high
probability of something happening. And therefore, it's from a, from my standpoint, or as we're, as we're investors, time to take the risk off the
market in the equity markets, it's too risky. It doesn't mean people aren't going to make money. If you're a speculator or gambler, man, we have 25% lifts
since December, never been a better time to make money. But I can tell you this markets go down eight times faster than they go up. Just remember that.
Eight times faster. All right. That's a great stat.
That's my, that's my rule.
That's the Gordon long rule of market action.
Yeah, that's it. That's what it tells me in my gut when I go through it.
Okay. All right. Well, look at this way. I can lose money eight times faster than I can make it if I have to. I have to pay attention to the risk
reward. It's not that the reward isn't great right now. It's the risk that goes with it. And it's assessing properly what the risk is. And as I
said, previously, the risk margin, the equity risk premiums are not big enough right now. Well, they are there, they're not being priced in properly.
And that'll change very quickly.
Okay. So let me just make sure I'm interpreting the graph correctly here. So these are m tops, meaning there are two tops. And after the second top,
it, when we have the similar conditions, you get a pretty big market drop and a recession. And it looks like in the upper right box here that we're
currently in right now, you are seeing the formation of the peak of the second M, or the second part of the M, right? Okay.
The outside, the outside strength, and technically, because, you know, m tops come in all all degrees, but yes, we're, we're in the top of the second
part of the, of the M, the outside strength.
Okay, which means soon on a relative basis, you know, if this historical relationship holds, we should start the downtrend, we should we should start
the bottoming event that you mentioned earlier. Now, this is a log chart. So if indeed that happens, and we follow sort of past trajectories, you could
see the S&P getting down to what here, about 2000 or so?
No, not not, not initially, not initially, anyway, the Oh, well, a longer term, it depends on the slope of the line. But certainly, I we see going down in
stages. Obviously, you know, typically, when a market goes down or up, in an impulse fashion, if you're an Elliott Wave practitioner goes in five waves,
and impulse and then corrects in two waves, and the structure in this will tell how it unfolds will tell us really how deep it goes. But the point I'm getting
to is the first wave down will correct everything we've had as a lift. And I'm saying probably probability, since since the COVID low, that's that's what we
need to correct. And then the next correction after that it starts to unfold. And we think that is in the cards is a correction that starts to take us
down to correct the lip that we've had as we came out of the bottom of the 2008 financial crisis. So again, we get then we have the potential to get down
there. But that doesn't mean I refer to them as killing fields, you know, it's going to be a very difficult thing to trade because it'll be quite violent
initially, before people start throwing really capitulating and throwing in the in the towel.
Okay, got it. And that's all yeah, so great additional detail. So once it starts correcting, it's obviously not going to go down just in a straight line,
there'll be some violent jumps and corrections, I was just trying to get a sense.
So at the beginning, as you change the sentiment, and the attitude, and money starts to disappear, because remember, we're so highly leveraged. It's when
people start to are forced to sell that comes with the capitulation. But that's gonna take a while to bleed out. But as that capital is killed, it
starts to accelerate. And this time, it may may be worse than the previous ones, because we've never tested this ETF regime that we put in in the last 10
years. And for those who remember the 2008, when Paulson and Bernanke headed up to the hill, and they were scared stiffed, when I was a Thursday, I recall
what could happen in the market, because all of the and at the time, all of the CFOs were going because we broke the buck on at the time, on on money market
funds. And they had because all the CFOs were going to their computers and we're moving their money out overnights into longer into into protective act
protecting assets. And it was $5 trillion. And it scared scared the Jesus out. And it was correctly this time $5 trillion is nothing in comparison to what we
have with the ETFs. And these are not people on screens that are CFOs just these are moms and pause who have got their, their for or other IRAs, who
suddenly are beginning some losses, and they're going to run for the hills at some point. Okay. But it takes a while to go out through through that process.
Okay, so a little negative, just telling you the worst case. Yep, yep, no, no, no, don't worry about it. And we've had sort of a similar prediction or
caution cautionary tale told by Michael Green, who spends a lot of time focusing on the net capital inflows, passive inflows to the market, right? So
so right now, any additional dollar that gets invested in the market goes disproportionately to a very few number of stocks, right? And that's just
because of the the algorithms that and his warning is, is if those flows ever go negative, you know, we're going to see that effect in reverse, where
we see those few stocks get hit disproportionately hard. And because they're so widely owned in the markets, and they drive, they represent such a big
portion of the major indices, though, they're going to have a disproportionate effect and dragging those down. So don't worry, you're not the only person
sort of saying, Hey, we should be careful about this.
Well, that's why the that's why these patterns resonate, or this particular pattern, you go to the second slide I had with this one,
I will go in one second. I just want to make sure people understand one thing here. This is not a I'm not saying this is a prediction of yours. But if we
get sort of the worst case scenario here, where do you see the S&P having the potential to go down to?
My first stop is 3270 currently, and after that, it could get much worse as I'm describing, but I don't I don't I don't, I can't call that right now.
Okay, I just want to give people a reason. And I wouldn't want to. And the reason is, never ever underestimate what the powers to be, will do to the system to try and shore it up.
And if you remember, in 2008, I said bottoms are events. What was the event in 2008, that turned that market around came out of nowhere? Well, it's very simple for those that were there.
The Fed, behind the curtain, without telling anybody in the public market, they move from mark to market on the derivative structure, which by the way, is now in measured in the
quadrillions, we went from mark to market and took it out, and they could market anything. And a lot of banks were sitting on $84 billion in derivatives. So suddenly they
could so money was suddenly unlimited. So it's they'll change how we do our accounting or the regulations. And you don't know when will what they will be and when they will change it.
So, you know, typically, it's historically been they print the money, they may, you know, a lot of banana republics, they'll come in and seize your pension plans to capital, then we all you'll see capital controls and all those sort of things.
That's, those are the unknowables at this stage. But what is, I believe, very high probability is at least that first wave down that I see down to around 3270.
Okay, great. So don't let me put words in your mouth, I just want to make sure folks understand, you're saying you can easily see a correction, initially, that gets down into 3200 range,
that could, if left unaddressed, get a lot worse, but highly unlikely that the central authorities are going to sit on their hands, and we could expect anything from them. We've seen a playbook in the 2008 crisis, we've certainly seen them be willing to do more stimulus than anybody ever thought imaginable during COVID.
So, so, you know, it's going to be an uncertain road. Obviously, Gordon, if this starts happening, we'll have you back on and give us sort of play by play action. Let me just
quantitative easing. And now suddenly a common name, we could never had quantitative tightening, we're doing things we've never done before, as simply reactionary. And by the way, I mentioned this mark to market, you know, we never put it back on.
It was never put back on. So what are we pricing this entire derivative structure, which is on every element of Exeter's pyramid of, of assets and how you measure asset, well, you know, real value, tangible wealth.
And so, you know, my sales on every level, there are elements trading in derivatives on every one of those, we saw that in Britain.
With the insurance companies in the last, last spring, it almost brought down the guild, if you recall, I do, when it said, So those are the exposures, and they'll, they'll, but they will react, they have to react.
Okay. And that was my last question here, which is not knowing what they're going to do, I assume you place a quite high probability that they are going to do something and probably something pretty substantial, should that initial shock down to 3200 happen?
Without question. Okay. Great question is how effective it will be and how long it will last. Because until we fix the debt structure that is now becoming insurmountable.
Because we've, you know, we've got debt increasing faster than the real growth of the GDP was currently measured as GDP. That's a whole discussion.
When debt increase growing at a faster rate, then you're creating the supposed wealth, it doesn't last. So that's, and we're in that boat right now.
So Gordon, I have to try to restrain a chuckle when you say, until we fix the debt issue, do you think we can fix the debt issue? I mean, is there a path to fixing it that you think is actually realistic? Or is that, is it more sort of until we slam into the debt crisis, because we're not going to address the debt?
Proactively, we'll be forced to do something with it. But it's, we could spend, we could spend an hour trying to figure out, talk about how they're going to do it.
But the debt will force changes in the in the global financial system. You cannot run the be really blunt, you cannot run a 650 billion, a trillion dollar swaps market.
It's unregulated, over the counter, with no visibility other than through the global banks. That's what it is. Go to the Bank of International Settlements and look at how many interest and currency swaps are traded around the world.
And the nominal value of that is in the 600 to 700 trillion dollar mark. What's the global economy?
Okay, the United States, we're 27. So around $86 trillion, makes no sense. So that's how they're currently holding it together. So, you know, you know, why those numbers, maybe we can add some more zeros and keep it going.
Probably we'll try. We'll try.
Okay, but this is sort of getting a little off track. But the issue, to be blunt, is the problem we face is not the increasing of the debt.
It's the increasing of real wealth, or collateral. We're not increasing the collateral and underpins all of the lending that's going on. And the collateral is not growing at a fast enough rate.
And we use something called rehypothecation, which means moving many, many people claim the asset, but it doesn't, through innovation, they move it around and nobody seems to understand any of this, believe it or not, except the banks do.
The banks understand is in gory and their lawyers in gory detail. But until they, and the reason we aren't growing well fast enough, it's all paper. Money and contracts are just paper claims on wealth.
And I think the last time I was here, I said to you, the only way you create wealth is you got to grow it, you got to build it, or you got to mine it. You can't print it.
And that's the problem. We seem to have forgot what real money is and real wealth is. We're going to get an education on that in this decade.
All right. Sorry, we're going to get an education of that in this decade, meaning the repercussions of growing our claims on real things much faster than we're growing the real things themselves.
That's going to finally catch up with us. Yeah, it'll catch up to us, but it doesn't mean the world's going to come to an end. We'll just have to do some major restructuring and changes.
They'll actually maybe be blunt. Band-Aids will be put on the system until we finally come up with a solution to this. And the solution is we have to understand we have to get back to sound money.
We went to a fiat currency in August of 1972 when the US got off the gold standard. '71, '71. I apologize. Two weeks after I was born, yeah.
And so that's when things started to really change. But the big change came in 1980 when Volcker, behind the scenes, we started the international balance of trades, we started accepting credit
versus gold transfers that were done through the Bank of International Central. That's when everything changed. And that's, if you look at the charts, when financial assets exploded at the same time, because you could use
paper assets to get it. Now, when I say going back to sound money, I'm not saying we're going to go back to a gold standard. Not going to happen in that kind of context.
But we're going to go back where we reset the system, where the underpinnings we can all believe in, and we trust it. We trust it. I mean, it's always been gold and silver, but it doesn't necessarily have to be that.
It typically is that because nobody trusts anybody else, and it's the only thing they trust is the history of gold and silver. But if you're forced into it, and again, a little long-winded, but if we're forced into a corner, it's amazing how people start to really get together to solve the problem. And that's probably what's in the horizon.
Okay. All right. I'd love to have a conversation with you at some point, Gordon, about what you think the right solutions should be, and also what investment opportunities might come out of that new era.
But we've got a lot of road to go before we get to that stage, sadly. I think that's going to take a while.
Yeah. So let's get back. Let me help you get back on track here. I put up the second slide, and I know we've got many more to try to get through here. So I'll try to ask fewer questions and just let you run.
Oh, okay. I wasn't meaning to go through the slide, but I thought there'd be some whatever you wanted to talk about. But let me run through the ones I did send you. This kind of brings it into perspective
of just taking the top 50 at any time. And I went all this going all the way back to the 60s. And there's the Nifty 50 I mentioned earlier over here on the left.
And then as even more, and what we're measuring is taking the top 50 stocks, and you can see
this getting fewer and fewer. Now we're down to like 0.84 on them. And now as we were recently
down even further, but since the mag seven came in and the bit the end of this parabola here, parabolic
lift was really what's happened with artificial intelligence. I think it will be huge. But I also
believe the internet was huge and we were right. But the markets eventually get into reality and
price things differently. And that's it. That tells you really in one chart, what's going on
here. And what I found interesting is everything in the markets about rate of change. It's never
about absolute numbers. And you notice the the peak of the valley and the peak and where we are
right now line up perfectly. I thought it was an interesting suggestion on timing that we're pretty
close to something abruptly changing, because markets work within boundary conditions. And
that's what it's telling you. If you go to the next chart. I'm just trying to put in some meat
onto what I've been been suggesting here. This is a parabola, a parabolic rise that we've have,
and I connected the bottom, you can see here with with COVID. And there's a cycles charts on the
cycles that we went through, we've been actually using this chart for a few years now. And with a
dotted line specifically, and then we saw the COVID, we had to readjust the line number. But
when we saw the vertical line, at the next peak on the cycle down, that's a vertical red line,
and it was starting to signal, you know, 5180, that sort of thing. We thought it was absurd,
and it would have broken broken down, we just we just didn't understand how it could happen. But
here it is. And it's sure enough, it's it's climbed up. I'm not suggesting there's anything
magic in that 5186. At the end, parabolas are funny little instrument. And if you get into
Elliot waves, they truncate when you these is and we may get a truncation much sooner than that,
we don't know when it is. But right now, that's the kind of the error that that we're there,
we're in. And it's been been very predictive. Want to go to the next the next chart?
Sure, I will. I just want to note that you've got the 5186.
There's nothing magic in that. That's just what it is.
It's not a magic number. But I just want to note that we are only 100 points away from that right
now in the S&P. So we are getting close to that number, whatever its meaning turns out to be.
Yeah. And here's the the M top or the dome top. And measured down with the Fed funds rate here
in the chart in our proprietary will be called we have a proprietary proprietary measurement
for momentum. And we have a major divergence here on the very bottom against this top over a longer
a longer period of time. And so even though we have this big movement in this chart,
it really puts it into perspective. We're just putting in the M top the flow over in the in the
red. And then the correction that I show because we think the structure for those that are in Elliott
wave will be what they call a double combo corrective Z pattern. I did just leave it at that,
which is a y x and a w down of three structures. And it's been playing out and they work in fractals
all the way down and the fractals have been working pretty well with their difficult to
measure but something like that. The point being, the drop gets down to the COVID line on the rising
black channel, where we got the lows of the COVID crisis somewhere in there on this kind of
corrective comes up, maybe a test the that dome underline of the of the black channel, but we
think that black channel from the financial crisis is very much a possibility through the course of
the next three to five years. It could be sooner could happen very abruptly.
Okay, I just got to ask my regular question because you've got the data here. So you see
in the middle of this chart, you've got the fed funds, right? Correct. You know, just about every
other major market drop was preceded by an aggressive rate hike campaign that then plateaued
for a period of time. And then the economy fell into recession and the markets went down with it
and the Fed was more or less chasing all that by trying to quickly cut rates. You could look at that
and say, well, if we look at history, that's what we should expect going forward from right about
here. But of course, everybody is saying, Nope, it's different this time, the lag effects are not
going to matter. So I'm just gonna ask my regular lag effect question, have the lag effects been
magically dispelled this time around? Or do you expect them to come? I mean, you mentioned you
think there's going to be a recession at some point in the next year or so? Will that be due
to the lag effects finally arriving? Yes, and you know, the Fed funds rate follows the two year
Treasury bill. Without question, it just does the Fed never leaves Fed follows the fall, it follows
the region, the banks, the banks actually tell them what it should be. And then eventually they
move, they move on it. And right and right now, the two year is quite lower. So we're at a point
where we get there, the banks are suggesting the answer to your question, that the lag effects are
getting very, very close in here to really coming into play. And what's confusing them and confused
us for a while is sorting through the real impacts of rate increases, because so many people,
ourselves included, took advantage of those old rates, and locked in money, corporations,
now a lot of our net interest, even though rates are going up, they're making more money
on their balance up from the interest rates, because they're protected on having sold sold
bonds mortgage, why is the mortgage market in a position that it's in with use use housing,
nobody can move out of their use those because they can't afford to give up that mortgage rate
they bought their first house in to go to the second one. So you know, and I can go on with
that they're just so much of that money has been locked in that increasing the rates just hasn't
done the job yet. But it will and it'll be and it's slower. And that's what's dragging, dragging
it out. And part of that, too, is we also push so much money into the savings, people didn't pay
rants, the forbearances, etc, that money starting to dry out. So it's, it's taken a lot longer,
but it's, but it's, it's going to come. Okay. This chart, I, you know, I like to put some
fundamentals in the whole structure. And I'm a big supporter of the work that Jon Hussman does,
who probably tears apart fundamentals better than anybody I've ever witnessed. And then he doesn't
put out this chart very often. And these are key inflection points where all of his measures are
some of them over here start to all line up together under basic technical and fundamental
analysis. And we're right at that point right in there where something should happen. And he's been
consistently right. With his measurements over a longer period of time, which is just a way of
saying, if you look at all the other measurements, they're also lining up with it. So if we flipped
along, you're just moving along and some of these so everybody can get as big a picture as possible.
Another reason is, is dragging it out, is we've got this, this, this match, I'm gonna say a fight,
but it's actually orchestrated. What the Fed has been doing with the increasing rates, it hasn't
been tightening liquidity. It really haven't, even with quantitative tightening, to some degree,
and it's because there's games that are being played. Everybody watches Powell. Frankly,
we watch Yellen. It's Janet Yellen that's really behind the scenes playing the games right now.
And it's through the TGA, the Treasury General Account over here on the right side. And I've
got to show two phases here. Because what what's been going on is, we've been taking money out of
the reverse repo market, we had $2.7 trillion sitting there, we've taken it down to 500 billion,
and even in lower, that money went over to the Treasury, was taken, went into money market funds,
it went into short term, and Yellen has been driving out T-bills, not longer duration money.
So she's been taking selling, you know, one week, two week, 90 day, six month kinds of money. And
you can see it with that slash line. And that money turned around and went right out of the
economy wherever the government wanted to put it. You know, the government's put through $6.7
trillion in spending, but it's how it's flowing out into the market. I know up here in the Northeast,
if you're in a solar business, if you're in a heat pump business, man, they're just everybody
everywhere trying to take advantage of those of that money that that's flowing out, the hiring,
the jobs, etc. So that's what's been going on since we came out of the the debt ceiling
discussion last June. What we're in now is the beginnings is on the bottom of another sophisticated
game that were played through the banks taking advantage of the bank term funding program,
the large banks, the big banks who are then stopped abruptly after they got out about $60
billion that they take out, they flow through the money managers, went into hedge funds,
is now ready and able to go longer term to five and seven and longer term duration. So the feds,
between Janet and the Fed, they're fully loaded to keep this economy in good shape. Well, plenty
of liquidity all the way through the election. So that's that's basically what's going on behind
the scenes without everybody. Everybody's so scared about foreign investors and the
auctions. It'll be fine. Okay. So appreciate the structure. It's fascinating. We've talked a bit
on this program. I didn't mean to get so detailed, but some listeners know it. It's wonderful that
you've had because this has been one of the biggest conundrums for folks, which is that,
look, we've been in this quote unquote, "hiking and tightening cycle," and yet starting at October of
2022, all boats have started rising again. And people have been wondering why. And we're supposed
to have these lag effects and all this stuff. And we've had some speakers on like Michael Howell,
who used to work for Salomon Brothers, who said it's all about net liquidity flows.
But everybody sort of has their own measurement of net liquidity. And it's something that's opaque
to a lot of regular investors. So what you're doing here is you're really exposing the mechanism
by how it's happening here. And basically, your punchline is they being the tandem of the Treasury
and the Fed can keep this stealth liquidity going well enough through the election, where you're not
that worried about there being some sort of dire economic news that could look bad on the current
administration getting up to the election, which, of course, is the goal of any sitting
administration coming up to a presidential election. There's nothing unique about this.
But you're basically saying they can hold it together until then.
In theory, it does sound like you think at some point, the recessionary forces are going to win
out of this, whether just because they get large enough and enough time is allowed, or because
the election is over, and they take their foot off the accelerator because they don't need it anymore,
don't necessarily know what the trigger is going to be. But you do think at some point,
correct me if I'm wrong, probably after the election, probability wise,
they hold things together until then, but at some point after,
they can't and those downward forces that you've already shown in the previous slides begin to
really take effect. You can only do it so long, but they can come up with another chart,
another one, space stage three in here to the wildcard in it is they don't control the world,
nor do they really control anything other than interest and floating more debt.
Things can break. We have the commercial real estate office complex in serious problems right
now. And that's going to take the regional banks and the regional banks are in serious problems.
That's not an understatement. If you look at the $600 billion that they've got is unrealized
capital losses unless they hold it to maturity and they can't afford those. So we have a whole
series of things that are happening that can break this where liquidity doesn't make any difference
unless it's completely targeted at the problem as this BTFP was originally when we first had
the banking crisis starting to show primarily in the smaller banks and the regional banks.
If you flip to the next chart, Adam, you'll see because you made a statement that we got freeing
up and having a better liquidity and financial conditions or better. They never really did make
it tougher. This is the Fed statement. This is the Fed sheets from the friends, the Chicago
financial conditions index put out by the St. Louis Fed agreeing. We've always been the only
thing you do you see is the slope of the line of whether it's even easier. It's always been easier.
It's just the degree of how easy and that's what's really missing in here. What confuses people is
the banks, yes, have tightened their credit. No question. Credit standards have got tighter,
but there's enough money and loans that are out there that the liquidity is just plenty
and that's actually what's currently driving the financial conditions index to get even looser.
You see it going down here. Most charts you'll see is expanding dramatically is because of this
phase two, phase one of the stealth liquidity that's being pushed out into the market,
but anything can break this at any given time. These guys are not gods and they're doing the best
they can to keep it together, but the financial system is so complex and as I said earlier,
the derivative structure that's behind all of our markets is un-policed, it's unregulated,
and it's a wild west show and things can break very quickly.
Gordon, former head of the Office for Management and Budget under Reagan, David Stockman wrote a
book, I don't know, eight, 10 years ago called The Great Deformation about all of the intervention
that was done in the wake of the great financial crisis. I've always really appreciated that term
defamation because that really is what is going on. You would otherwise have true price discovery
if you just let market forces have their way, but with all this intervention and these different
stages and all these efforts to keep things artificially propped up, you begin to deform
the system. What I hear you saying is the more you deform the system, the longer you deform the
system because it's such a complex system and it requires more and more scale of intervention to
keep things propped up as time goes on, that when the system does get out of the control of those
that are trying to control it, the consequences, the collateral damage is higher. Would you agree
with that? Absolutely. That's exactly right. The longer we keep kicking the can, the bigger the
crisis will become and the more systemic it will become, the more secular it will become longer
term. But we will kick the can and keep doing it. You can always count on the politicians
and the political class to throw money at the problem. No matter what they do, they will print
the money. They will point it at whatever problem that they perceive it to be. That's the world that
we live in. You can't kick that can indefinitely. I don't know when that's going to be. Maybe I'm
long gone before it's finally resolved. You shouldn't stay up nights worrying about that
if you're an investor. Know it's there and know how to make money in what you can make money on
this year, next year. Okay. Well, I'm going to go to the next slide because I do want to get
soon to the topic of, so how are you positioning given all this setup that you see here?
Yeah, one of the things that's going on is we're just misrepresenting the problem and even in how
we're reporting. We've argued for years that inflation was not what it was. People are
familiar with John Williams over shadow stats when it takes it back to how inflation CPI was measured
in 1980s, 1990s. It's dramatically higher than what we currently have because of hedonics,
substitution, imputation. There's a whole bunch of strategies that they've used to keep it in.
Even when we look at inflation, it is worse than we report economically, but there's a bigger
problem. We measure everything against GDP. I've been watching, just as a backup for those that
aren't familiar, GDP stands for gross domestic product and GDI is its sister. They equal each
other, gross domestic income. They're within hair distances. They're supposed to be exactly the same,
but because of reporting, fact gathering data, there's a statistic anomaly and they've usually
tracked very closely up until the current administration took power and started this
onslaught of $6.7 trillion of increase in the national debt and borrowing the money to do it.
I'm not passing judgment on whether that was the right policy strategy. I'm simply saying that the
GDP is supposed to equal the GDI. Nobody pays attention to the GDI. If you look at the next
chart, this shows you the difference that it's not supposed to be. It was how the system was
designed. It's a double accounting system and it says they should be exactly equal. You can see
in Q3, we were reporting GDP over here at 1.5%, or a GDI rather, and over on the right,
the GDP was showing 5%. We go back to Q2, it was 0.05 and 3% comparison. What is going on?
You can see the year-over-year differences. It is just dramatically larger. If we're measuring GDP,
it should be what's our debt against our GDP. It should be what's our debt against GDI. Frankly,
I believe it should be against our GDI. The reason we got into that years ago,
GDPs were created by surveys so we could put out the numbers. They all come from
ledgers. That's before automation, so it was later. We got into the habit of looking at GDP.
We should be looking at GDI. We go to the next chart to try and make sense out of it.
If you look at the GDP, what we're doing is we're measuring value on one side, but we measure it
in terms of expenditure. This is the big difference, expenditure, and these are the
elements that are in the GDP. It's about how much money you're spending and where you're spending.
That expenditure money should be the same as what the right side, which is GDI, which is really
measuring what the income is. Somebody spends the money, they're spending it, that's an expenditure.
Somebody else is getting it, whether it's a person, it's a company, somebody else gets it,
it's income. They have to equal or they should be exactly equal in a more or less closed economy.
What's happening with inflation, you're seeing a complete different performance on one side
than on the other on each of these line items. More importantly, the amount of money that we're
pushing into the economy is really distorted. We're not creating wealth. We look at GDP and
we say it's value. It's not value anymore. It's really just money because we're borrowing the
money and it's debt. It's creating some level of income, but it's on transfer payments.
We borrow money from foreigners. In the GDP formula, that's called I, it's investment,
so it's added there. The government's got it. They spend it. That's called government spending.
We say there it is again. Then they give it as transfer payments to the consumer,
we're a 70% consumption economy, all sorts of transfers from Social Security, Medicare,
disabilities, etc. They spend it, we call it consumption and we say economy's good.
Except when you look at the GDI, it says, "I don't think so here." That in a nutshell is really what
the problem is. Real quick, the lower GDI numbers are basically indicating that the economy is
weaker than we're being told by the folks looking at the GDP numbers. I just want to marry that to
the Fed has basically two mandates, price stability and maximum employment.
We look at the low unemployment rates- And a third, keep the government financed.
And keep the government financed, which clearly seems party number one to them.
It's the number one priority. Looking at the unemployment numbers as well,
and you gave a nod to this earlier, I don't know if anybody believes them anymore. Even the Fed in
their latest minutes made a comment about we're seeing some disparity that we're not sure if
these numbers should be taken at their face value. So literally nobody believes them anymore.
So I just want to underscore, you talked about how complex the system is, how we have these massive
derivative overhangs and whatnot, just this massive complex tangle. And we've got humans
trying to navigate their way through it. And are they navigating their way through it actually
using faulty instrumentation if they're looking at the GDP and they're looking at the BLS reported
unemployment stats and those type of what might be sort of erroneous or doctored stats?
Yes, they are. The central banks are not naive to anything I've just said here,
but they work in a political environment where a lot of CEOs aren't economists.
And so they have to explain things in a way that they understand and see in the realities,
but underneath it, they also understand the real value of money and what they have to do,
but they're restricted in what they can do. And remember even who's appointed now to control the
boards of the things like the FOMC, their political appointments. Well, and to that point,
the Capitol Hill people, you know better than I, but my assessment of their economic understanding
is I rate it pretty low. Would you agree? There's a lot of talented people in the central
banks who really know it, but the time they get the information starts to lift up to the board
and the decision makers. It becomes a political set of decisions. Right. Well, then on the fiscal
side, I mean, I'm talking more about Congress and whatnot. I mean, I was talking about the
monetary side, which I assume is a bit smarter on the politicians. I haven't got a clue.
They're bright people. I don't mean to be critical. They're bright people, but they don't
understand any of this, nor are they interested in doing interesting. I had a friend of mine
actually make a presentation. Richard Duncan made a presentation to them here not long ago based on
his book. Richard spent more time explaining to them basic economics. Economics, right. One of
the reasons why I raise this is what's sort of different this time is in the past, certainly
after coming out of 2008, it was the monetary side that did the majority of the lifting, but now we
have a huge fiscal stimulus, ongoing fiscal stimulus component. That is more controlled by
people that have much more political than economic agendas. Only political agendas, as they rightly
should be in many regards, but it's the questions of the other political priorities that they have.
There's a lot of questions of what their priorities should be or are right now.
That's a whole other discussion on it. But this is a chart I'd mentioned earlier with the growth
of the national debt versus GDP. As bad as it looks against the GDP, we're just in a discussion
of whether even that's valid. You can't run an economy and sustain it very long when this starts
to happen. These are not my numbers. These are the federal governments. This is a formula I
mentioned. One of the big issues is we're no longer in the United States, an industrial
country the way we were. Therefore, exports and imports have changed so dramatically. That is the
things that pay our bills and we're a service economy, which is fine, but really we're just
moving the money amongst ourselves. As long as we don't buy anything, we're fine. But if we have to
buy something and pay for it, like Japanese electronics or whatever money goes out of the
country. We're importing cash into that I there, and then we're pumping it around in our formula.
And I mentioned the issues with it. It just creates a lot of distortion. It creates huge
amounts of distortion. And that's one of the that's obviously a problem we've just been discussing.
This chart makes it easier for us to really understand. It goes back to the previous
tops that I've showed you. You can see at the top here. This is the yield curve here
that we're showing the dot com, the financial crisis, and the current situation we're in.
And then below it, we mirror in what actually happened with the markets. And then at the
bottom, what's happened with the with our measurements on momentum. And you can see the
yellow areas, the pink areas, where they where they react differently. But they all react the
same way. If you go to the top, or you actually go through them, they all mirror each other.
And so over here on the right, COVID really distorted the timing in that as I said earlier.
But right now, we're our projection is that little dotted line of when we yield curve finally starts
to revert. And we're starting to see that climb back up. That's that's actually if you look down,
when the market starts to really crash, really starts to go down, doesn't go down sooner than
that. So you know, that's a projection of when we see it. And that's, you know, there's more
behind us. And that's that that charts to suggest maybe it's the spring when we finally starts to
revert here, or July, that's when we go into the pink area from the yellow area on that on that
inversion. But that's what we watch very closely. And why we're primarily involved in the bond
market right now. And in that element of it, and not in the equity markets, because this is a
little bit more predictable for us with a better risk return. Okay, I don't want to spend any more
time on it. So there's a lot of there's a whole session on just that here. Okay, but let me ask
one quick question. And I'll go to the next slide as we do that. But you talked about how the Fed
and the Treasury, working in cahoots, stage one, stage two can keep the economy likely duct tape
together through the election where, you know, the wheels don't come off. Now, the economy and
the markets are two different things, although sometimes they do get very correlated. Do you
see a potential that the markets could behave differently than the economy this year? Yeah,
I do. I do. Okay. Very strong possibility of that. All right. And it just a tack on
question because I want to let you explain further, but is how motivated is the existing
power structure to keep the markets elevated as well through the elections, just trying to keep
everything look rosy, keeping everything look rosy for everybody? Never been higher incentive to do
that. But you think but it sounds like you think the markets still could get out of their grasp?
I do. I do. That could happen very, very easily. But they're doing everything they can do. And
they've got a lot of money to be able to look what happened with the banking crisis, how quickly
they reacted. They're not naive to the problems. They're not naive at all. And they're looking at
everything and what they can do with what facilities they need to bring to bear. Remember,
during the dot com, we had 12 facilities, but it took them a while to unload them. I don't think
it'll be that long. They'll be very quick. And some of them they'll do without even telling us
to keep this thing going. What we got going is, you know, when you said cohorts here between the
Fed and the monetary and the fiscal policy, we've got the Fed playing a pivot game. And that's all
focused on the Fed pivot. We know it's coming. It's not coming as fast as people think,
but it's coming. But on the other side, we got what I call the Treasury put. And I love this
chart because it actually uses that terminology. And that's what's going on. And that's what we're
just describing is the put where the Fed, where the Treasury, not the Fed, the Treasury will take
the money that's coming out of the TGA and target it because they're targeting wherever they want.
If you read the bills, the Inflation Reduction Act, they can spend the money
under the Congress almost with an open checkbook. It doesn't detail it down at all.
So they can point that they have other things. They have an 86 billion dollar fund just for
market stability. I think people refer to it as a plunge protection team, but
which is a formal structure to target areas. So they keep it under wraps. A bigger concern,
and this chart's really leading to it, is the, and it's a big point, but we're in Obama,
but the concern is with currencies right now. The dollar has been really strong and rightly so.
I'm not a flight to safety, but compared to the situations in Japan,
the EU, China, we're the best looking economy in the world right now on the surface as bad as I
made these comments. But the issue is in the currencies. And what can happen with the dollar
here is the pivot will not be good for the dollar because real rates, Yellen has been pushing out
tips right now and buying them, which has been pushing up the rate and driving down
on the price. That's what she's issuing if you look underneath it, which is helping real rates
climb. And the higher the real rates, the more attractive we are not. Don't ever look at nominal.
Always look at the real rates. Unfortunately, they're going to start to turn. And when those
real rates start to fall, the dollar will start to weaken. And so that's the bigger issue. And
I didn't say dollars can collapse right now, just weakness. It'll resume the drop we've had from a
couple of years ago. We've consolidated. And so we see the dollar starting to weaken. And that's the
thing that they're really, they want to manage that, that drop that's ensuing. And this chart
is really showing you that it's really ready to go because just the dollar moves with the deficits.
It moves with deficit spending, trade rated averages and trade balances.
It moves with what's happening with the real yields. And all of those are saying
dollar correction has got to start to begin. By the way, that's good for the equity markets
because when the dollar cheapens, it makes US stocks more attractive. And it could be a game
they want to weaken the dollar even to shore up the markets as we get into the election. Don't
want to speculate. Just telling you something we're watching. Okay. I think this is the last
chart we have here. Yeah. To put it in perspective, this is something that I get quite upset about.
And people say, well, inflation's behind us. It isn't behind us. It's still in front of us.
What we did is we fixed the COVID supply chain shock that hit it. And at the same time,
the amount of money we overreacted and needlessly put into the economy. And we've mucked through
that with the shock that we've created. And we'll be sorting that out. But we went through three
waves in the 70s. And it took us 10 years. I'm not saying there's three ways, but we have another
stage here. We have a massive energy problem. And I'm not talking about just fossil fuels.
I'm talking about electricity generation because what we're doing with coal that's global and the
amount of money we're investing, we're going to have energy appreciation. What we're doing with
our food stocks right now is a major concern. I was just reading the other day our beef herds
are down by 2%. And a farmer's bills with the inflation reduction act are up by $1,300 a farm.
So these, on all their balance sheets, these are getting hit hard. So there's a real consolidation
happening in the food industry. Meanwhile, we have a bigger and bigger demand and for it. So I think
we're going to see a scarcity. And as part of that's de-globalization and de-risking that's
happening too within the supply chains. And then, and then shelters and another problem, but we have
waves here and eventually the currencies weakness are really going to start to show. So I, and you
can see this is out over the, what I call the beta drought decade. So I think that be careful with
you, your expectations on inflation. All right. So Gordon, phenomenal walk through all that amazing
data. I thought we were going to get two charts out of this. No, you put them all together.
I apologize to our listeners who are still with us for me, taking you through all that.
Gordon, look, if there's one thing I know from the viewers here is they appreciate data. So don't
worry. You were feeding them exactly the meal that they wanted to eat. So now we get to the key
question here in the last couple of minutes, which is how did I get all this? Right. A lot of cross
currents, a lot of efforts by the status quo to kind of keep things patched up for as long as they
can. You think eventually they're going to lose control. What I pieced together from my notes so
far, and why don't you just detail out, but I hear you saying it's time to be defensive on equities.
So risk off on the equity side of things, plan for the dollar to weaken relative to other currencies,
maybe a good time for bonds. What do you have to add beyond those notes?
Credit markets, sir, you can invest in credit markets rather than just bonds and corporate
instruments. But that is kind of the scenario that we're looking at. Right now,
we're more or less not in the equity market, and nor are we on inputs in it at all. We kind of see
that as something that we'll spend a lot more time on as we drift into Q3, into the July timeframe,
into September. Right now, we've been primarily focused in the, have been focused in the bond
market. And it's been doing really well. We've taken profits and moved into latter treasury
instruments because we think that there's still a little lift in here. But let me get before it's,
the pivot itself starts to generate capital gains, never mind being at a fairly good yield.
But I'm saying that as though we've been in the bond market, still playing the bond market,
we're now starting to move or we know we're going to have to protect the bond market earnings
through currency, the US dollar weakening. So trying to hedge our losses or our gains, rather,
on bonds that we'll get with currency depreciation or devaluation. So the point being bonds,
currency, then I see equities as this starts to unfold. The bigger comment to your listeners is,
I do this for a living and have for a lot of years. And it's tough. It's really, if you're,
do not have a professional advisor who really understands this, you're going to be a chattel
to this game. This is a very, very tough game. Get a good investor and stop, don't be a speculator,
don't be a gambler. Try and get back to solid investing. I don't mean to preach.
I just caution our listeners to, it's so easy to get greedy. This is when again,
you know, I think Adam had an old expression, bears make money, bulls make money, pigs get
slaughtered. This is when this adage really rings home. So those are the primary instruments. I
actually see a lot of investments that are outside the financial markets are in, I'll call it just
private equity, small businesses that are going to do well, that need funding, can't get it through
the bank or looking for money to handle cash flows. There's a lot of those that are suffering
the problems with the small banks right now and credit unions who want to lend it to them.
They've had related, but can't lend it to them. And there's investments there of all sizes.
That's super interesting. Gordon, maybe next time we have you on, we can dig a little bit more
deeply into that. It's a very lucrative market right now. Okay. I presume you really need to
know what you're doing though, correct? Well, at least try and know what you're doing. We don't
even know. All right. Well, I really appreciate you underscoring two things. One, don't be a
gambler. And I have a sense from your comments at the very beginning about how Momo and FOMO
are driving so much of the equity markets right now that you're really putting a finger on that,
which is to say, "Hey, look, we're probably in late stage, irrational exuberance right now in
equities, so don't fight the emotional resistance to get sucked up in that." Because I think the
average retail investor, it's hard for them to resist that siren song when they see their
neighbors making a ton of money overnight. I also very much appreciate your point-
Remember that the neighbors are bragging when they make their money, but when they lose,
you never hear from them. You never hear it, yeah. Until the moving van shows up and you see they
have to leave, sadly. But I also really appreciate your point there about the financial advisors and
regular watchers of this program hear me say that every week, that for the vast majority of people,
especially given markets that are a market environment that's challenging,
if you don't have a ton of experience being a successful DIY investor yourself, recruit the
help of a good professional advisor. And you've just helped me make that pitch for the guys from
New Harbor Financial who are going to come on in just a few minutes here. So anyways, Gordon,
thank you so much. It's always so wonderful to have you on here. Anytime your models tell you,
"Hey, we're entering a new phase," please let me know, and you are welcome to come back on
this program and let the audience know about that. Two last quick questions for you. One is,
for folks that have really enjoyed this discussion and would like to follow you in your work,
where should they go? Matasi.com, M-A-T-A-S-I-I.com. They exclusively handle anything
that I write. I got roped in years ago to writing a newsletter to explain ideas, and it led to one
thing or another. So it's available. It's free. For charts and everything else, go with it. We
charge a minimal subscriber fee. I really recommend it. You used to have a look at it,
and you can decide from there. It's a great newsletter. And folks, if you
paid attention with those charts, you know exactly the type of thing you're going to get.
I subscribe to it. It's a wonderful newsletter. All right, Gordon. And then the last question is
one I've been asking our guests recently. I don't think I've had the chance to ask you it yet on
camera. We've been talking all about money and financial investing in this discussion. What's one
non-money-related investment that you would encourage people to consider adopting in their
lives? I don't know if I'd call it an investment other than an investment in yourself, and that is
what I'll call self-reliance. Never before have I-- people have got so accustomed to listening to
what they're being told through the media, through any sources that are people that are apparently
experts. And that really calls into questions a lot of whether you are getting good data,
but not about that as much as yourself. You've really got to become more self-reliant
on what you want, following what you believe, as opposed to following what's the narrative
or standards that are being pushed at you right now. It gets into simple things like materialism
and whether you should be taking on more debt or you should be creating more savings,
because savings rates are just plummeting in this country as credit is going through the roof. Is
that the right thing for you and your lifestyle? So this focus on who you are, what your moral
compass is, and therefore I'll call it just self-reliance, is so important. Everybody says,
"Oh yeah," but they tend to just follow the herd. This is not the time to follow the herd,
potentially over a cliff. And that takes some real solace. It's tough to be self-reliant
when somebody else is bragging about all the money they made. But if you don't have that,
you're going to be in that slaughterhouse. That's great. If you don't stand for something,
if you don't know what you stand for, you'll fall for anything, right?
So wonderful point. I agree with you 100%. And just to give a nod to the work of a mutual
friend of yours and mine, Gordon, Charles Hugh Smith, writes a lot about self-reliance. In fact,
I think the title of his latest book was Self-Reliance, and highly recommend if folks
are interested in learning more about that topic, go over to Charles's website and check out the
book. And to Matasi, because Charles and I have actually been doing videos on exactly this subject.
Oh, absolutely. All right. Well, so Gordon, when I edit this, I'll put up the link,
the URL to Matasi clearly on the screen. Folks will also put links to it in the description
of the video below. Highly recommend folks go and listen to those podcasts. Two great minds
and conversation together. Gordon, always a pleasure, my friend. Thanks so much for
joining us today. Thank you for having me. Look forward to talking again.
Well, all right. Well, now's the time of the program where we bring in the lead partners
from New Harbor Financial, one of the endorsed financial advisory firms by Thoughtful Money,
to both give their reaction to the discussion with Gordon, but also tell us anything notable
that's been going on in the markets over the past week. I'm joined, as usual, by lead partners,
Michael Preston and John Lodra. John, let's start with you. What was your reaction to
Gordon's discussion there? Hi, Adam. Great to be with you again, and great to hear Gordon's chat.
What a really enjoyable talk that was you had with him. And I don't say that just because he's
a fellow Massachusetts resident. We had a good chance to connect with him offline with you before
the recording here today, and we hope to be able to bump into him in our home state. But look,
we agree with a lot of his take on things. He did a really, I think, very good job exploring the
macro and realities of the situation, with a humility that I think is really important,
because there's a lot of, and we've been guilty, I suppose, sometimes of lacking some humility
ourselves. There are plenty of reasons why these markets are absolutely disjointed from reality.
But there also is an unprecedented degree of extremism on both monetary and fiscal policy that
we can't ignore in terms of trying to keep the ship together. So we need to make accommodations
for that, and I think he nicely did in his talk. He made the point that has been the theme of the
last couple of years, at least anyways, of how narrow the stock market has been,
and he paralleled it to other major bubble top episodes in history, the '70s with the Nifty 50
and the 2000 tech bubble. We are in a very similarly narrow market. We have the MAG-7,
which has now become the MAG-5, or maybe four, with some of the high flyers starting to falter.
Tesla, Apple's been weak, so it's a narrowing among those generals, if you will. To be fair,
off the balance of the October low of last year, we saw a broadening out. We saw things like mid caps
and even like the equal weight S&P 500 start to outperform on a relative basis. That quickly,
as the market started to reassess rate drop odds for this year, that quickly tilted back in favor
of these really concentrated MAG-7 and momentum. If you look at factors, there's a whole kind of
battery if you can look at different kinds of factors, dividend stocks, low volatility stocks,
value stocks, growth. The single factor that is year-to-date, heads and shoulders above the rest,
is momentum factor. If you look at the momentum factor screen, if you will, it's about 17%
up year-to-date versus even the cap-weighted S&Ps up like six and a half, I think. The equal weight
S&Ps up a little less than three. Russell 2000 just went positive on the year. And we have seen
a breakout of sorts in the Russell 2000. It took out a multi-month point of resistance. So we are
seeing some broadening, but still it is a very narrow market. He talked about an S&P target
eventually. So he talked about, he thinks that we're in a kind of an M top, a double top,
if you will, in the markets that probably will look similar to the '70s and the 2000 peak.
He was, I think, reluctant, but was willing to point out perhaps a downside target of 3270,
I think he said, which is about a 36% decline. I think he certainly was not bashful about saying
he thinks they should go a lot lower than there, but the policymakers will step in. We totally
agree with that. Fair value is certainly way below 3270 if you look at historical metrics.
You know, he talked about the Treasury put, which has taken the place of the Fed put. Absolutely
couldn't agree more. The fiscal side, fiscal dominance, I know Lynn Alden, for example,
who you've had on your channel has talked about maybe an era of fiscal dominance. And I think
that's one area that perhaps we think will create a little bit more of a headwind for the bond
market than perhaps some people think. Just recently, we've seen several Treasury auctions
really not look really good. You know, bid to cover is not good. Tails really looking quite
ugly, to use a flavorful word. And as the Treasury has telegraphed that they're going to start to
shift from bills issuance to longer term coupon issuance, we do think that that will create
more of a headwind longer term for bonds than perhaps this slam dunk bonds are a great buy.
You know, we're getting in the area where we do think increasing our allocation to longer term
bonds makes sense. Maybe we see somewhere close to four and a half on the 10 year Treasury. That
would be an area that we'd want to add a little bit more to our very modest position in longer
term bonds. But we're definitely, definitely still overweight the short term Treasury part of the
bond curve. So those are my big picture takeaways really, really like this humility and zooming out.
Oh, and one thing I want to give them props to pointing that the real bottom in the market in
2009, wasn't the Fed cutting interest rates or that values had had gotten too screamingly low,
must buy, it was the Fed secretly, essentially going out there and removing the
market to market rules and essentially in one fell stroke of the pen rescued the system.
So that's just an emblematic example of the extremes they'll go to essentially rewrite the
books to try to save the system. And that's something we as money managers have to be
cognizant of, you know, that they can't maybe stop everything from falling apart,
but there is a line in the sand where the kitchen sink will be thrown at it.
Yeah. And I think that's what's so challenging in this environment to fundamental investors,
right? As I would almost make the claim, it's maybe rarely been easier to sort of see the arc
of where things will head given the status quo continuing. But the problem is, as you know,
the status quo is going to continue that the rule book is going to get rewritten along the way,
like you said, right? So it's, you got a position for what is likely to happen based on the math,
but then you have to have part of your brain ready to react in real time
to whatever the rule changes are going to be. Yeah. And you're nodding as I'm saying this.
Yeah. All right. Well, Mike, how about you? What else would you add to John's commentary there?
Oh boy. There's so much here that I want to say. There's a lot, there's a lot in that,
in that talk. And a lot of times that I was listening to Gordon there, I thought
I was listening to ourselves. I think that he's a disciple of some of the same things that we are
and have been for so long. And certainly with Hussman there.
Absolutely. He mentioned Hussman. In fact, since you mentioned it, I'll go there first.
He put a chart out that said that the S and P is in a parabola. And then he also put that chart out
that, that John Hussman just did in his interim comment the other day. It talked about the set
of conditions being very extreme. You really can't predict the timing and you can't say for sure that
something bad is going to happen or the market will drop, but Hussman's chart
showed the extreme set of circumstances that are very rare, real. Gordon talked about the market
being in a parabola. This has been, this has been very difficult because if you remember that chart,
there was several parabolas there, but this, this market's been in a parabola for close to 15 years.
Right. And it's tried to correct. And I could even argue it's been more than 15 years. And every
single time it's tried to correct, it's been rescued with yet another magic trick, another
rabbit pulled out of the hat by the federal reserve. And so to be a prudent discerning
investor has been really, really tough, really tough. And if you're a disciple of math,
it's been really tough. And some things haven't made sense. The whole bubble in mean stocks
hasn't made sense. The bubble in crypto didn't make sense, although crypto certainly looks like
it's here to stay and we give respect to it. And you know, Bitcoin, it looks like it's going to
make an all time high, but so many things we haven't known what's real and what's not real
because of the fact that money has been printed out of thin air. And if Gordon talked about,
these people aren't gods, you know, they're not gods. They're not flawless. They may think so.
You know, I don't, I don't know what they think frankly, but they're not gods, just like Gordon
said. And things can break. And when things break, the consequences can be a lot worse than you think
they're going to be. You can't take a system and push it to the edge of reality like we've seen
here and like we've been living through for this long. And the hard part about it is if you look
back at that chart of the parabola, you just don't know when it's going to end. And if you're not in
it, you feel terrible, you know, so we have, you know, we've adapted some over the years. And so
we're, we're participating some we're up to about 40% notional stocks, but we always have to keep
our eye on the ball and realize that this is a crash prone market. And we're always thinking,
well, shoot, if this thing crashes, what's our exposure. What's our plan. What kind of hedges
do we have in we can, we have hedges that we showed in previous videos and happy to show them
again today, if you want, we keep moving the hedges up with the market. And I'll be the first to say
that this market probably goes a little higher. We're sitting here just under the all time high
markets up around 16, 17 S and P points today over the last week and a half, two weeks, it's
tried to pull back a little very reluctantly. There's been some pockets where some stocks
have sold off last week, Palo Alto networks today, snowflake is off 30%, 25%. So some of these leading
stocks are starting to implode, but still the vast majority of them are charging higher. So this
market hasn't given up. So that's the point. We don't know when the parabola will end. Nobody does,
but they've pushed so far that things are likely to break and they're not gods. And this is the
cost. There's a moment of equilibrium and a moment of justice coming. I know it. I don't know when I
think it's this year and we have to be on guard for it. So Gordon's absolutely right to be out
of equities in our opinion. He said he's basically out of equities and he's making some plays in the
bond market. We're doing the same, although we're up to, like I said, closer to 40% equities with
our hedges that we will have to accept a couple percent loss if we get some kind of mini crash.
But nobody knows how that's going to happen. It could be a slow decline. It could be a crash all
at once. We've got the hedges in place to take care of that and to layer into the market and
get more aggressive as we see lower prices, hopefully, over the next year or two. I don't
think there's going to be any rush to get in. So I think that's about, those are the things that I
saw. And he's absolutely singing our tune about criticizing the Federal Reserve. Sorry, but that's
the truth of it. History says that these things don't end well. Well, so great recap. I want to
go back to something I asked Gordon right at the beginning of the discussion, which was,
hey, Gordon, you've seen a number of market cycles. And this one,
he was telling us before the camera got rolling that this felt very similar to when he was
managing capital during the dot-com boom. And he had the wherewithal, which he said was really,
really difficult at the time, was to get, he had written up the boom pretty well, but had the
wherewithal to get out in late '99 or early 2000 and said he was just taking heaps of abuse from
a lot of his investors for missing the continued run-up that was going on in the market. And it
just felt like a punching bag for a period of time. Then, of course, the bubble burst and
everybody was singing his praises and thanking him for having the fortitude to do that.
But it just shows how incredibly hard it is to make these gains in a market like this and then
keep them. Because most of his peers held on the market burst. They then got into that trap of
bargaining. Well, we'll just hold on until things come back up enough and then it never happened.
So I want to underscore that because if it's hard for a capital manager like him or professional
managers like you to be navigating this, super hard for the average retail investor who's just
trying to figure this out on their own. And I want to share this headline here from ZeroHedge,
which is that investors are finding it increasingly pointless to be bearish. It's just
like a classic headline that you see near a market peak. It's just where you see capitulations at
market extremes. And it seems like we're at the point of capitulation for the vast majority of
whatever remaining bears were left. I think Gordon did a really good job of saying, "Hey, look, if we
look at the data, there's a whole bunch of reasons that we need to be skeptical of those that are
selling the Goldilocks and it's going to be forever sunshine and rainbows from here on out."
But there's an increasing number of investors who were just saying, "Look, I had concerns. I looked
at the fundamentals. I looked at all these other things that you guys have talked about and it's
just been beating me up portfolio-wise because none of this stuff is mattering." So John, I'll
hand it back to you because I figure that that's got to be something that a number of viewers here
are saying, "Hey, look, I've watched a lot of your guys' videos on this channel. I read a lot
of other people who have similarly waived reasons to be concerned about where we are, but man, my
idiot brother-in-law just keeps telling me about all the money he's made in Nvidia this week and
I'm feeling like a heel and yeah, maybe things are different this time." Yeah, bubbles are
incredibly hard and they're not hard because of intellect or anything like that. They're hard
because of psychology. Look at the famous story about Sir Isaac Newton having the foresight to
get out of the South Sea trading company stock only to get back into it because you couldn't stand
that it rose up multiple times. Basically because his friends were getting rich. Yeah, exactly. And
he lost it all, right? So it's not about intellect, it's not about smarts, it's all about psychology.
And I think about folks like Jeremy Grantham, legendary cycle investor. He relates how his
firm basically was getting criticized in the late 90s for getting out of the tech bubble too early
and of course early wasn't wrong, it was just early. And here's where as managers of people's
real money, our clients don't get a do-over. Our role as psychological counselors is probably more
important than anything we do in these kinds of phases because ultimately it's that psychology
that tempts people to want to do the wrong thing and we're human, we all have that. And the only
reason we're able to somewhat keep our wits about us is because we ground ourselves in the data and
the historical lessons that we can study and learn and know from history that, hey, it's never the
same but there's all these timeless lessons that keep on getting crammed into our psyche. And for
us, it really comes down to our clients and why are they investing in the first place? It's not
to win some competition, it's to provide the funds they need to survive for hopefully their lifetime
comfortably without stress. And these kinds of episodes playing in them, they may feel good if
you can ride but it's actually the point that is most important not to play in them in a big way
because that's where sound retirements can absolutely get devastated. We have our own
YouTube channel that we try to speak to our clients and folks from the standpoint of what
it means to be a client and what are the important things. I just dropped a video this week on
retirement income planning and the common risks and pitfalls that we see all the time. And perhaps
viewers want to take a look at that because it really emphasizes that, hey, you're not retiring
for a year or three years, you're retiring hopefully for 20, 30, 40 years. And trust me,
missing out on a 10% late stays bubble advance has no bearing on your financial success for the long
term but the flip side of these parabolic moves are historically devastating. If you're unlucky
enough to retire in the year 2000 and followed a traditional investment program, you got decimated
because the market lost money over the subsequent decade. When you retire can be the most unlucky
point in your financial planning and recognizing that when valuations are rich and returns are
likely to be disappointing, even negative for a substantial period of time, it makes all the
difference to play it safe and know that things will come back to more compelling valuations that
are constructive to help grow those assets so they can sustain your lifetime. The stakes are
really high right now. We don't ever forget that in terms of what matters to our clients.
I appreciate that, John. And it goes to what Gordon was saying, which is at the end of the
day, it's all about value like you were talking about. And Gordon just says, yeah, we have to
look at it in terms of risk and return. Can equities go higher from here? Yeah, absolutely.
There's probably still some octane left in that tank. It's the associated risk that comes along
with it that he's saying, my firm just says, we don't think it's worth it, which is why we're
getting out. And you're just saying more or less the same thing, especially for those that don't
have a long investing horizon left ahead of them. Their money needs to last them well the rest of
their lives because they've retired and stopped working. So the key thing is to look around right
now and say, OK, where does the risk reward make more sense? And Gordon explained why he thinks
it's in the bonds market. And it's a big part of your guys' positioning, as you said. All right,
well, look, I want to wrap it up here. Mike, I'm going to give you the last word real quickly
before I do. I just want to remind folks, because this is where all my focus is now when I'm not on
camera, is preparing for the upcoming Thoughtful Money online conference on Saturday, March 16th,
which is coming up like a freight train now. If you're watching this today, this video is getting
released. You have sadly, if you haven't already registered, you've sadly just missed the expiry
for the lowest early bird price discount. But there's still good news. For the remainder of
this week, we have our last chance to save price out there before tickets will then jump up to the
full ticket price for the final week. So if you're kicking yourself for not having moved early enough
to lock in the early bird price, don't worry. You can still lock in the last chance to save price
before tickets go up to full price there. Just a reminder, too, that if you are a premium subscriber
to our Substack, you will receive $50 off in addition to the last chance to save price.
So make sure that if you're a premium subscriber, you enter in the code that we've emailed you,
or if you're not one yet, become one now and enjoy that $50 discount. Just go to our Substack,
AdamTaggart.Substack.com. It's only 15 bucks a month. I'm totally happy if you sign up just
for one month to save the $15, to pay the $15 to save the larger $50 and pocket the $35 in savings.
I want you to get the lowest price possible for this. All right, Mike, as we're wrapping up here,
well, first off, again, before I hand you the football, I just want to remind folks because
Gordon already made my pitch for this. But if you are a regular
investor just trying to figure out how to navigate the future that lies ahead, everything that Gordon
laid out there, everything that John and Mike have been talking about here, if you're feeling
a bit vulnerable, a bit underprepared to be the captain of your financial ship through all that,
again, highly recommend, as Gordon said, that you work under the guidance of a good,
experienced financial advisor who takes into account all the macro issues that Gordon and
I talked about. If you've got a good one who's doing that for you and then executing it
in real time for you and reacting to changes on the ground and certainly prepared to react to
whatever rulebook changes might come flying our way, great, stick with them. Those advisors are
extremely rare. But if you don't have one or if you'd like a second opinion from one who does,
maybe even John and Mike and their team there at New Harbor Financial, then fill out the short form
at ThoughtfulMoney.com to schedule a free consultation with these advisors. These are the
guys that you see on this program with me week after week. These consultations are totally free.
They are no commitment. There's no strings attached. It's just a free public service
that these financial advisors that I've recruited to this program provide to help as many people as
possible position as prudently as possible for today for what's likely coming down the pike.
All right. With that, Mike, I'll hand you the torch here for the final word.
All right, Adam, very quickly, I'd like to share one more chart and then just a closing comment.
I'll try to be as fast as I can. So the chart that I haven't shared in a few weeks is that of gold.
Can you see the chart now? I do.
All right. So this is gold. It's, I believe, the biggest base I can find anywhere in any security.
I'm sure there's others that that look better than this, but this one looks the best to me.
Anything out of anything I can see. This chart goes back 20 years over the last 12, 13 years
since the 2011 top gold has formed this giant base. This is called a cup. This would be a handle
over here. It's kind of complex and longer than that than normal. Gold is kind of carved out this
channel over the last one, two, three, four going on five years now. And so we're sitting right at
the top. This is a monthly chart. Take a look here. Today is the last day of the month. We're
filming this on February 29th. This is what's called an up hammer. It's a bullish monthly
candle for what it's worth. Doesn't really mean much in itself. It's the overall structure that's
bullish. We've got one, two, three tops. Triple tops don't usually hold in markets. This asset
has carved out the biggest base I've seen in my professional career. And it's my opinion that this
is going to break out and move higher. When we get a close or a couple of closes above 2100,
I believe gold is going to move higher towards 2,500. It's why we think that people
should have some, it's a good investment. It's a good hedge for the, those that don't have gold
consider 10, 5 to 10% of your investable assets. Gold miners, we readily admit have been lagging.
We're a bit puzzled by it too. There's a lot of arguments as to why mining shares have lagged so
badly relative to gold. All I can say is that we have lived through or seen periods like this for
10 to 15 years where gold miners have underperformed and we're sitting at historic
underperformance levels. Some say it's because of regulation. Others say it's because of energy
costs. Others say it's because of bad management. All of the above can be true and probably are to
some extent, but a lot of that's baked in and mining shares are trading at really severe
undervaluation levels. And if we get this breakout higher, I think the market will wake up and the
miners will at least to some extent play some catch up. So our mining positions are hedged to
some extent. We've got 50% of them hedged right about where mining shares are now. And so we're
just holding on and helping our clients hold on through that ride. So let me stop sharing.
The last thing I'd say is this is a bigger deal than you think. Gordon talks about how we're
likely in a grand super cycle situation. He mentioned Elliott Wave, something that we're
familiar with as well. To some people it's hocus pocus and it's certainly not the only thing we
look at, but it's one of many things we look at. We consider the fourth turning and the fact that
we're probably in the closing years before turning. We look at math and charts and realize
that we've never seen these numbers before in any of our lifetimes. It's a bigger deal than you
think. And all of this is to try to balance the world or balance everything on a pin, kind of like
a Chinese acrobat show where everything's spinning and you don't want anything to fall and it won't
break. And so far the Fed has been able to keep all the plates spinning. But we don't want to
scare people and Gordon doesn't either. It's going to be fine. There's going to be opportunities.
The first turning is going to be great, but don't feel the need to emotionally be in this.
Talk to us, talk to a professional, or just get the heck out and sit in 5% treasury bills
for a while. And so that's how I'd like to close. Thanks, Adam.
All right. Well, well said there, Mike. Well, gents, thanks so much for joining me for yet
another week. Whatever happens in the ensuing week, we'll have you guys back on next week to
make sense of it for folks here. Everybody else, this was a long one. Thanks so much for hanging
with us. See you next time. See you next time. Until next week, Adam. Thanks.
Bye.
