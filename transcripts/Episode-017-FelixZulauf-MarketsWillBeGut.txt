Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its
Felix Zuloff, founder and CEO of Zuloff
Consulting, who presciently predicted
that we've entered the decade of the
roller coasters where markets will rise
and fall dramatically as the natural
forces of deflation battle it out with
the rescue efforts of the central
planners. Now, Felix manages a prodigious
amount in assets so he doesn't have the
luxury of having an opinion without
conviction. He's got a strong picture of
where we are in the current market cycle
accordingly. Felix, thanks so much for
waiting very eagerly for this
I mentioned you don't do too many
interviews and it's always great to
catch up with you and hear what you see
ahead but I've got to tell you you were
the number one most requested interview.
So in between your infrequent
appearances here it's just a rolling
thunder of people saying, "When is Felix
coming on next? When is Felix coming on
next?" I'm so glad we were able to finally
scratch that itch for them. Well, look,
I've had a lot of questions for you,
Felix, and I know it's been a pretty
interesting year. If we can though, can
you tell us a little bit about the high
level question that I like to begin our
discussions at, which is, "What's your
current assessment of the global economy
and financial markets?"
The global economy is actually quite
weak. US investors forget that because
they are focusing on the US and the US
is virtually the only spot that is still
doing well. Europe is stagnating or
recession, a borderline of recession.
China is stagnating,
struggling with secular structural
issues that will
keep China from going back to high
growth as we have known for many, many
years.
And the US is the
hot spot and I expected the
US economy to be weaker than it turned
out.
I expected to see the
recovery in the stock markets from the
lows last fall
to be temporary and I think the Fed
made a mistake by easing too much. I
think they underestimated the bank
reserves and added too much liquidity
and are still adding too much liquidity
that really turned the recovery into a
mini bull cycle
that I expect to peak in the first half
and most likely in Q1
when the Fed will realize that they
added too much liquidity
and we may run into inflationary problems
again.
And the most extreme consensus that I
see in today's world
according to the global fund manager
survey by Bank of America
is that we are dealing with a soft
landing,
that the bond market is the most
attractive asset to own
by far, actually much more attractive
than equities
and I think that the consensus will be
tested because
when forecasts and experts agree
on something to such a degree usually
something else is going to happen.
And my hunch is that the surprise
in the first half of the year is that
the US economy
will turn out to be stronger than
expected
and could create some problems for the
bond market
and that the second half due to higher
as another spike in yields and rates
the second half will be weaker than
expected so we will get
both sides.
First the stronger version and then the
weaker version and I think that will
also
impact the markets. 2024
could be one of those few years that we
have had
in the history of the stock market where
we have an important
new high and an important low in the
market
like 2020, like
2018 or 2022 actually also.
Then you have to go back to 87 and then
further back to 62
and 37 so it doesn't happen very often
that it has happened
more often in the last few years really
performs according to my expectation of
rollercoaster markets
in this decade and I think we will get
more of that so I expect the
stock markets to go to new highs
probably
shy of 5000, 4900 or something like that
in the S&P
and then a big decline and that decline
could surprise on the downside for the
one particular reason
that never before in history
have portfolios been so
concentrated in so few stocks
and so when the market begins to decline
investors and portfolio managers
have the major asset that is
the FAANG stocks, the magnificent seven
and I think they are in for a big decline
and they will bring the indices down and
that could even
lead to a situation where the market
sees the low 3000 in the S&P
in the late summer of
2024 after having seen a high
before in the first quarter
and then that will bring on a weaker
economy because declining asset prices
hurts the consumer
and then we have a soft recession, a mild
recession
and that brings the authorities back
and stimulate again what they always do
and they inject liquidity and then we
have
a running market to new highs in '25
and maybe even into '26 and the same for
commodities
and that will bring back inflation in a
bigger way
so I think the next wave of inflation
in '25, '26 in particular will likely be
way above 10% and will create
problems for the bond market and that
will then trigger
the next wave down in the stock market
in that roller coaster picture that I
alluded to before.
Oh my goodness. So much in there.
A lot of excitement, Adam. It's definitely
not boring what you just said and it
really does,
if this comes to play, Felix, and your
track record has been
very good so far,
then you were absolutely right in
describing this as the decade of the
roller coasters.
I'm almost thinking
I've been to amusement parks, you've got
those rides that are like the
the freefall demon drop rides and it
sounds like we're gonna have a few of those
possibly in here, too.
That's a possibility next year.
Yes, it's difficult to forecast such an
event because
the trigger could be an outside
event or it could just be
what I described, the heavy concentration,
the historic concentration
of assets in the equity portfolios.
Well, look, I want to dig into
to all of this. So if I
heard you right and I've been taking
notes furiously,
you expect that
next year, as you said, could be one of
those rare years where we see an
important new high and an important new
low. Sounds like you think we're going to
enter the year strong.
Everybody feeling good, market run up to
much more weaker,
but then somewhere in the first half of
the year, sounds like you think maybe
near the end of Q1,
that's where things peak and then things
start to -- the wheels sort of start to
come off after that.
The big market risk you see is this
concentration of the magnificent seven
stocks. I'd love to dig into in just a
second why you expect them
to falter so much. Is it just because
they're so overvalued? Is it because the
economic growth that they're priced on
just isn't going to show up? But anyways,
when those start falling,
because they are so ubiquitously owned
and drive so much of the indices, if they
go down, they're basically going to bring
the whole thing down with them and you
think it could go as low
as perhaps 3,000 on the S&P
in 2024, so that really would be kind of
one was in '73
with the nifty 50s and those were 50
and they declined after that peak.
They were also overvalued,
excessively priced like today's
magnificent seven
and they declined between 50% and 90%
thereafter, not because those
were bad companies but because they were
overpriced and the high concentration in
the portfolios was in those stocks.
We had a similar thing in the year
2000 with technology and TMT
was the buzzword, technology, media
and telecom stocks.
When Deutsche Telekom was trading at 100
times
earnings, things like that.
You also had
a big decline in those stocks.
I recall because I had a mandate for a
major investment bank
in European stocks and I underperformed
in the last part of '99 because I was
under
represented in those stocks. I did well
but
I underperformed slightly and the new
management took
the funds away from me and put the money
into two new funds they launched,
technology fund and a telecommunication
fund. One was down 80% and the other
one was down 90%
thereafter. This is
when a fad goes to an extreme
and you have to keep in mind that it's
not just the U.S.
when passive investing and indexing
has become a new institutional trend
and in retail investors invest with
institutions and institutions then
invest
by indexing and those who do not index
they are closet indexes because the
business risk of
not being close to the index is just too
great.
I would say
that
probably over 80% of today's
capital invested in equities is indexed
or sort of indexed and if you didn't
want to underperform the market
you had to be overweight
those stocks and I recently read that
in the large hedge funds portfolios they
see
up to 70% invested in 10 stocks.
That's a heavy concentration. Now
when you invest from wherever you are in
the world
in a world index 62% go to the U.S.
out of those 62% 30%
go into those seven stocks so this
is an extreme concentration
and if the market for whatever reason
begins to correct and decline
that's the assets they can sell because
all the other
assets they are underperformed they are
underweight you know in a way
and therefore these could magnify
the decline and exaggerate the decline.
corrections and secular uptrends etc.
And I think the risk is coming
from another direction.
Sometimes market technicals can get in
you said it's 30 something cents of every
dollar coming in that goes into these
top seven stocks, right?
So it just keeps feeding the beast and
his warning which I think you're
giving a similar one here is,
"Boy, if that ever goes in reverse
you start having this
outsized effort of the draining
of this disproportionate
share from those stocks and from
everything indexed to them and so it can
kind of begin to bring the whole
house of cards down much faster than the
have never heard
about him but I'm sure he did his
He is a very smart man
and I'm sure he's going to love me
but anyways this risk is a massive
so big that again you think
that it could, no guarantees, but it
could essentially cut the S&P by
40% next year is sort of what you're
thinking from peak to trough on your
your guesstimates there. So I normally
save this for the end of the conversation
but why don't we start digging into it
right now. So how are you planning
on positioning for this? We've got
maybe a quarter left
of happiness and sunshine in the
badly and they are now catching up
and I think the cyclicals due to what I
said about the economy the surprises
could be that the economy holds up longer
and surprises by holding up longer
that the cyclicals have a catch-up play
and could even outperform
the magnificent seven into the peak
but I'm very light on that and dancing
close to the exit door.
My intention is to go short the Nasdaq
and S&P indices in a big way
sometimes in the first quarter and I'm
waiting for
for the signs to see you know we are now
we are now at about 60% bulls in the
numbers I look at and check the lows are
normally
in the market at 25 to 30 percent
we are now at 60 percent the highs are
normally at around 75 percent so we
still have a little bit to go
on the sentiment side we still have more
to go
on the trend and momentum side
I think over year end the central banks
will be generous with liquidity
and this will help the markets as well
so I think it's too early
to go short and and we are at the what
4500 or something like that and not at
4,900
as I expect.
So first off when you say that your
light long positions, does that mean the
majority of your portfolio is just in
short-term cash and cash
equivalents like high yielding T-bills?
The big bulk of the money is cash
and cash is paying a decent
decent yield. It's unlike a few years ago
when we had negative interest rates in
Europe
that hurt, that really hurt. It's a
different world from just a few years
ago.
It's a different world and in that
context it's important to understand
that the 40-year
secular downtrend in inflation and in
interest rates has changed in 2020.
I wrote in mid-2020, I
entitled a report I wrote that this is
the cell
of a generation for the bond market
and I think we traded at half a percent
10-year treasuries
at that time and went to five percent.
That was probably the first up cycle in
a new secular uptrend
and what I see into
later next year is a down cycle
maybe down to three percent plus minus
25 basis points
but in between we could have an
aberration
late first quarter, early second quarter
that we see another spike because the
bond
conviction is so high and so extreme and
and I've just seen recently
a survey done by JP Morgan's treasury
desk
among their clients and their clients
are more long treasuries than ever
in the last 20 years. So this tells you
how extreme the situation is and
when global fund managers
say the bond market is the best
asset to own over the next 12 months
that feeds into this. It's an extreme
consensus
and usually extreme consensus like this
go wrong.
Last time we had an extreme consensus
which was
lower than today in the bond market was
in late '08
and we had then one decline maybe 100
basis points
and then it spiked higher and 12 months
later
they were all losing money. So
I think medium term it's still
going on
and I thought the first decline
could be
to 370 or so in 10-year treasuries
and then I would be cautious
because it could spike to five and a
half percent or something like that
before going further down.
Okay, so I just want to repeat that to
make sure I heard you correctly.
You could see over the course of next
year
bond yields coming down say to like 3.7
percent so continuing
the recent trajectory of lowering
bond yields
but as things get wonky you could see
them
having a surge up to maybe five and a
half percent
but then as the wheels really come off
the S&P
goes down to say perhaps 3,000. You see
bond yields could get down to about three
percent.
Let's say it actually follows that
script. It sounds like from what you said
earlier you then expect bond yields
to start going a lot higher from then as
the central bank
really gets going on its rescue efforts
so 2025-2026
you would expect higher bond yields
lower bond prices.
Is that correct? Very much so. Yes, very
much so. The point is that
we live in a world that is ever more
leveled
than before and that means that in each
cycle the central banks have to inject
more liquidity than hit the last cycle
to keep the system afloat and and
prevent it from breaking down
and that liquidity then flows
into asset prices and therefore
I think thereafter you could see
6,000 on the S&P
in late 25 or even early 26
and we then launched the second
up leg in commodities. You know with the
low in stock prices
we have the low in commodity prices and
as you can see
commodities with the exception of gold
and a few others but the commodity
complex
is actually performing poorly because
the world economy is not doing well.
The world economy GDP grows at 1.5%
at present and 1.5%
in the past 50 years was a recession
a global recession and that is reflected
in the commodity market.
Once they begin to push liquidity into
the system commodity prices will go up.
I do not expect commodity prices to fly
in the next cycle because of very strong
demand
but because of curtailed and restrained
supply.
You have to keep in mind that
we are in the transition period from the
previous
unipolar US-centric world order
to a new multi-polar order
and we have now disorder and we have
rivalry and conflict
and wars and the two
parties the US with the G7 on one side
and China with the BRICS and other
organizations on the other side
they are in conflict and I think
about three quarters of the world's
commodity supply
comes from the big BRICS countries so
they will use that weapon in that
conflict
as the US is using technology in the
conflict
and therefore they could
reduce supply and make prices go higher
which helps them
and hurts the other opponent, of course.
On that I'm curious to hear your
and in many ways it's decisions that
we're going to be paying for going
investment but then there's
this what I like the term you use this
multi-polar disorder as opposed to
unipolar order
where
one we just have more people competing
around the way global competition for
these remaining resources is becoming
more intense because you have a lot of
countries and regions that can compete
more with the west than they were able
to in past decades
and then secondly these actually may be
used as
competition and this is a
small example but
the week we're talking here, Felix,
Venezuela apparently
just decided that they're going to
basically annex a region of their
neighboring country which
Guyana, which I'm sure
the Guyanans aren't for this at all,
but it's basically when
things start getting
real when the chips
are on the table it's kind of going to be
sort of every country or every trading
block for itself.
You're nodding a little bit as I'm
saying this but is that the kind of
future you see more of going forward?
Absolutely. We have a world where
the top dark is considered to be weak,
the US,
and the discipline
in world order is gone and therefore
for the last two years you have seen
more and more conflicts that were
underneath the surface surfacing.
It was Armenia and Azerbaijan,
Serbia, Guyana, Gaza,
you name it and we will see more of
that. I started writing about
coming conflicts and wars in 2018 and
I was laughed at by many at that time
and here we are. The war in
Ukraine is
not over but it's lost for the
West.
Russia is winning that war and I said
that from the very beginning.
You see what's going on in the Middle
East,
the Arab nations that were in conflict
with each other
to some degree. Iran and Saudi Arabia
have now lined up on one side
and
they request certain
achievements and behavior by Israel
and there is a big problem. You
see that the Houthis
are attacking ships in the Red Sea so the
Suez Canal
is becoming dangerous in a sense
and ships have to go around and you have
to make sure that the sea lines up in
Panama because the lake
has not enough water and this could also
lead to bottlenecks and higher inflation
in the months to come.
People forget that. The
fully globalized world that was working
very well for the consumers
is over. It's de-globalizing or it's
regionalizing,
nationalism is on the rise, conflicts are
completely different world you cannot
compare.
And this world and wars
are inflationary. So we are on a secular
rise in inflation
and we are now seeing the first cyclical
decline in inflation that will be over in
2024
and then we go into the next rise. So it's
a different world and those who are
extrapolating
the trends of the last 15 years
to the future will probably wake up
in an uncomfortable position at some day.
Because they'll be basically essentially
using the wrong playbook
for the new era that we're in.
If I can, let me just ask you a few
questions to try to make sure I suss out
the vision of what you told us
in terms of how you're planning on
playing this.
So you're going to remain light long
up until end of Q1
where you're then going to start loading
on your short positions in anticipation
of this pretty extreme fall.
So there's basically sort of three
opportunities to make money next year
from your playbook as I read it.
One is writing things down on the shorts,
which it sounds like you're going to play.
One is playing your expected declines
in bond yields. I don't get the sense
from you that you're going heavy into
that. And then the third is just waiting
for the dust to settle S&P to get down
to 3,000 and then deploying a ton of
liquidity and buying things at
much better valuations in anticipation
of the ride over the next year or two
years to 6,000 S&P and of course
potentially a rocket ride in the
commodities.
Which one of those are you kind of
putting your chips on?
You know that I think
the stock market will decline below the
3,500 level that we saw last fall,
but I'm not married to the idea that it
has to be the low 3,000.
So whenever I see the right signs in the
market that the bottom is forming,
I go in and I get long and I place my
bets.
And I'm also very keen on commodities
because I think commodities,
they are a thinner market, less liquid
markets and therefore you could get
more bang for the buck even
than in equities.
So commodity-related stocks,
commodities and indices, that's the way
that I plan to go. You're right, I will
not play the bond market
much or certainly not aggressively.
The current medium to decline will
probably end sometimes
in the first half of Q1 and then we are
in for a potential spike. I'm not sure it
will develop, but there is a potential
for a spike to higher highs. And if it's
not higher highs and it's just a rebound,
we'll have another decline and we will
trade a little bit, but we will not have
huge positions because the secular trend
in the bond market is against
investors.
And I appreciate you clarifying
that because I would say one of the
biggest points of difference with the
experts that come on this channel or
coming on this channel recently is some
thinks it's one of the best times to be
buying bonds right now and moving out on
duration and others are
not and it sounds like you see some
opportunity there but it's
not a safe enough bet for you to
really want to put too much money at
work in there because you see much
better opportunity to get returns if you
play your arc right. It's interesting you
say that because when you make a peak in
yields, a secular peak like in 81,
and I wrote a report then, the buy of a
generation for bonds,
it took several years until about I
think 85
until the decline in yields really
started, really started and it was just
moving around up and down at the high
level.
And this was the conviction
of bonds being certificates of
confiscation as they call them
at that time due to the bad experience
of the previous decades of rising yields
and declining prices.
And I think the same is going on just in
reverse.
You know people saw the fantastic
returns on bonds now for 40 years. We had
now a very serious bear market. I think it
was the worst bear market in bond history
in 50 years, cyclical bear market. The
downdraft in the ETF, the 20-year
treasuries plus was over 50%
and therefore they see the opportunity
which I understand and there is an
opportunity but it's a trading
opportunity and not an investment
opportunity.
Got it. Okay, great way to differentiate
it. Okay, so I'm just going to make a plug,
Felix.
Next year, if you start seeing the signs
of a market bottom, if it does start
following the trajectory that you
think it will, obviously after you tell
your private clients you are welcome to
come back on this channel anytime you
like and let us know as well because
we're going to have a lot of really
interested people who want to know when
you think the light turns green.
So again, it seems like you see big
opportunity. If we hit somewhere
around 3,000 then you expect the S&P to
be 6,000 within a year or two. That's a
doubling. Commodities you think could
perform even better, especially the
commodity related companies.
Could you speak for a moment, you
mentioned it super briefly, but could you
maybe speak for a moment about gold and
maybe the dollar as well and just what
you expect to happen to gold and
currencies during this time?
Yeah, I'm not as bearish as the
consensus on the dollar. That's another
consensus. Together with the soft
lending thesis,
the consensus is for a weaker dollar.
We have seen two medium-term declines.
Actually we are in the second medium-
term decline of the dollar of the
September '22 peak. We had one decline,
then a recovery and now we have another
decline. I think this decline is not
quite over yet, but the bigger part of
the decline
is behind us. It could in an extreme way
go
down in the dollar index to 96 or so in
an extreme way,
but not more than that. I take that
also from
the euro, which is sort of just the other
side of it.
The euro, when you look at the
50-year chart using the Deutschmark
recalculated to the euro,
115 is about
cement type of resistance. It's very, very
difficult to break through
and 112 was the recent high and
we are now at 108,
touched 110 briefly, so I think we are in
the later stage of this medium-term
rally in the euro
or the medium-term decline in the U.S.
dollar and the U.S. dollar of course has
many pitfalls as all the other fiat
currencies. Longer term they all get
debased
and eventually they will disappear,
but when the world is in havoc
and uncertainty rises
dramatically because of the changes that
I alluded to in geopolitics,
the capital of the world around the world
is trying to look for the safest place
and Europe is not the safest place.
Asia is not the safest place and I think
the capitalists of this world
consider the U.S. the safest place.
It's not perfect, you know, but I would
say it's the
least dirty shirt in the laundry
and in that sense I could see
more capital flowing again into the
dollar and I expect
together with interest rates bouncing
in sometimes from a first quarter low
I think the U.S. dollar will try to
attempt to rally
also. Whether that rally will be
powerful or not we have to see.
I think the dollar will be in trouble
once the U.S. Fed will begin to ease
because when the U.S. Fed eases the
dollar turns weak, when the U.S. Fed
tightens the dollar turns
strong irrespective of what other
countries are doing.
Virtually irrespective and this is
because the dollar
is still by far the most dominant
currency in the world.
It is still by far the most prominent
currency
used in international finance and
therefore
if the U.S. begins to ease we have a
much
bigger amount of dollars coming into the
global financial markets than
any other currency and that's why it
will turn weak.
You know it's sort of the mocha cup
and the bathtub differential. You know
when you
use water and it flows over
it doesn't have the same
effect in the bathtub as in the mocha
cup and and I think that's
that's what we will be seeing in the
market. So
from a first quarter low, early first
quarter low I guess
we will probably see another rally
in the U.S. dollar.
I cannot say how far it goes. I don't
think it will be dramatic.
Gold is
gold is interesting. Gold
2024
is the eight-year cycle low of gold
and I think sometimes we hit the low
sooner
than the theoretical low. So I think we
made the low
this year and the low is behind us and we
have had
first rally. We broke the new highs. We
had a
top short-term reversal that will
put the damper on the gold box sentiment
for a while. The big
buyer in gold is China
and gold physically has
been moved from the western world to the
eastern world or the global south
so to speak. The former emerging
market world and they need
because they are moving away from the
dollar as a reserve currency
and because the dollar has been misused
as a political weapon
against Russia and they and that really
told the world that
if you are not in agreement with the U.S.
and you have a problem with them they
could take all the assets away
in U.S. dollars so you better invest in
something else and therefore
dollar comes to mind and that's why that
part of the world is buying
physical gold and
that is bullish for gold. What was
interesting the recent rally in gold
for the first time in the history of
gold as I
recall it was accompanied by rising real
interest rates.
This is very unusual. It has never
happened before
and it shows you that this rise in gold
is not due to monetary affairs. That will
kick in later
once the dollar really turns weak
sometimes in 24 later in 24
when the Fed begins to ease but this is
due to
geopolitical changes going on in the
world
and I think we have seen the low. I'm not
like the gold bucks who always say we go
to the moon
in the gold price but I would think next
year we could see
2800 or something like that on the
upside.
Okay, I mean that would still be pretty material. That would be about a 40% increase from where we are right now.
Absolutely, yeah. I think we live in a very volatile world
geopolitically and in financial markets
and being a passive investor
your portfolio probably for the next 10
years stays even and you get frustrated
because your returns will be very
disappointing
so you have to make sure to stay on the
right side of these mini cycles that I
see going on and that I continue to
expect going on because if you don't
you will get a very disappointing return
from your investments. Well, to go back to
your roller coaster analogy, you may go
through the whole ride and then right
back up where you started. You may not
have made any progress over the course of
20 years.
Well, look, I think you know this,
Felix, we have financial advisors that
come on this program regularly
to show people what a good professional
financial advisor, how they
think about managing capital in
this type of world environment and
you're basically doing them a big solid
here by saying
the era of easy passive
investing has really much come to a
close and to make money going forward
over the next decade
you're likely going to have to take a
much more active
approach. So in wrapping up here, Felix,
I'd love to talk to you. I could
easily talk to you for another two hours
and the audience would love for me too
but I promised your folks that I would
respect your time.
Are there any other major trends that
are shaping or you think may shape your
investing strategy from here that we
haven't talked about yet?
We have talked about the major assets
where we haven't
touched on is the Japanese yen. You know,
Japan is an interesting
situation. The stock market performed
extremely well
because the currency went down
dramatically
and because the yield curve was lifted
which helped the banking sector
and bank stocks did very well and that
and that together with the export stocks
that benefited from
the weak yen drove the Nikkei to higher
levels.
We are probably not at the point where
the Japanese are going to change the
monetary policy yet.
They are still on yield curve control
modus. I think they
eventually will change and the most
important point is
when all the central banks of the world
begin to ease
next year, I think in the second half of
the year begin to ease,
the Japanese will not and at that point
of time
at the very latest the Japanese yen will
begin to strengthen
and keep in mind that the Japanese yen
is undervalued on a purchasing power
parity basis by about 40%
or so and the Japanese yen was
used or misused as the most
important funding currency in the world.
Which means translated into a simple
language
the short position out there
is simply outstanding and once the yen
changes whether it is from
current levels or whether it is
from 160 level later on
then it will be a dramatic move
and dollar yen could then easily go from
wherever it trades at the high maybe 160
to 100. So I think that will be
a gigantic currency move.
I traded the yen occasionally and
I think the current situation is sort of
resembling
the late 1990s in the dollar yen.
I remember in 98 the dollar yen was
trading at 148 and about three weeks
later it traded at 108.
I was long
yen and short the dollar
via options. It was
one of my better trades and that's why I
like to remember myself about it.
I had other trades that didn't work out
that well and I
was in touch with Julian Robertson
because Julian
I knew for many years before
we talked occasionally and he was on
the other side of the trade
and I told him about it and he didn't
believe it and
that move really crushed a tiger
and then he reorganized his whole
organization. So
the move that will come and
I'm not sure whether we'll have another
move higher first
into the 160s on dollar yen
together with the dollar rally that I
expect
early next year. Once it turns it will be
a fantastic trade.
So is the main way you plan to take
on decades ago? Yes and I will do
that via options.
Fantastic. Well again, just to put it out
there, the door is always open for you to
think, "Hey, now's the time to really start
moving into that trade."
I'm so glad I asked about that because
that's a great opportunity I
wouldn't have thought to have asked you
about.
So Felix, thank you. I've got one other
important question to ask you which I'll
ask in a second which is we've been
talking about
investments to be making with your
financial assets.
I've started this very nascent new
routine of asking our august guests like
you for their thoughts on any non-money
related assets that you would
urge folks to consider adopting in
their lives. Real quickly before I do,
besides watching you when you come back
on this channel the next time you've got
something important to share with the
world, is there a place that folks can go
to follow you and your work in the
interim?
You can send an email, info@felixzulauf.com
or you can go to the homepage
felixzulauf.com
and our marketing people will take
care of it, yes.
Okay, great, and when I edit this, Felix,
I'll put the URL to your website there up
on the screen. Folks, I'll also put a link
to it in the description of this video
below so you can just go there with
one quick click.
Alright, well folks, please show your
appreciation for Felix coming on this
channel and sharing so much of his
expertise and his planned strategy with
us. Do that by hitting the like button
and then click on the red subscribe
button below if you haven't already, as
well as that little bell icon right next
to it and I want to remind folks too
that I have started, I've resumed my
practice of releasing my Adam's notes
which are my key takeaways from the
perhaps none as important as this one
that we've just done here with Felix, so
if you want to read my notes from this
interview, go to my substack, become
a premium subscriber. The URL for that is
adamtagert.substack.com.
Alright, Felix, we're at the key question
here. What's something that is not
necessarily financially or monetarily
related that you would encourage today's
listeners to think about adopting in
their lives?
Well, human beings are social animals
and I'm a family man so
I tried from early on when we had,
when I got married and had relationship
and kids
to invest a precious amount of time
to my family and I think family
and partnership is exciting,
it's inspirational, it's joy
and if you have all of that and peace in
your relationships,
that gives you so much power
for the rest of your life and for other
things in life.
At least that's true for me that I find
that a very important aspect of life.
Alright, very well said. My wife who is a
marriage family therapist would agree
with you right there, Felix.
I also talk a lot about this channel,
about the interviews that you can find on
YouTube where they sit down with people
who live to be over 100 and they ask
them, "Okay, you've done life. What's the
most important things?" and they say they
always say the same three things but the
first one is always the quality of the
relationships and so I think you really
nailed it with that one, my friend. Thank
you so much for coming on the program,
Felix. It's just been an absolute joy.
Really look forward to seeing what
happens next year along your
predicted path here. I've got to say
though, your past predictions have been
scarily prescient so I'm definitely
personally going to be putting a lot of
thought into how to position based upon
what you've laid out for us here but I
can't thank you enough.
Okay, thank you very much, Adam, for having
me. It's always a pleasure
and I will certainly come back, yes. Thank
you.
You're going to make a lot of people
happy with that. And speaking of which,
everyone who's watched, thanks so much
for watching.
