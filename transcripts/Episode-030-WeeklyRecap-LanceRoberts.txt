Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm Thoughtful Money founder and your host,
Adam Tegert, here back at the end of the week for another weekly market recap.
The first of the new year with my perspicacious friend, portfolio manager,
Lance Roberts of Real Investment Advice. Hey, Lance, how you doing, buddy?
Apparently two weeks without me and you've been in the pisaras already, so.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, right? Isn't that what they say? Now,
Lance, you being perspicacious, I know you know this, but just for the very
few who may not, it means insightful and knowledgeable, right?
And I think those are both words that describe you very well. So perspicacious
just seemed to fit you to a T here.
I just want to see you spell it.
Pardon me?
I just want to see you spell it.
I'll take a hard pass on that one.
So anyways, so interesting start to the year here.
Want to dig right into it with you real quick before we do, though, at
the end of our last recap from two weeks ago, we realized we hadn't really
flagged for folks an event that your organization has coming up in just a
little over two weeks.
Do you want to talk about that?
Yeah, absolutely. So on the one of the big events this year, obviously, and
what's been in the headlines, of course, is the presidential election. We
have, you know, this year's the fourth year of a presidential cycle.
We have a very potentially contentious election coming up in November for
the presidency. And again, you know, what does that all mean for markets,
outcomes, investing? How should you prepare for that?
So we went out and searched for a person that kind of really specializes
in that type of analysis. And that's Greg Valliere, who used to be with
Charles Schwab.
He's with AGC Investment Group. And, you know, he does a fantastic job just,
you know, going down. He's a great speaker. He's very entertaining.
Does great analysis, though, on the outcomes of presidential elections. Of
course, you know, while we're giving that presentation, we'll also have
Michael Leibowitz talking about bonds for this coming year.
What to expect from interest rates, the bond market. Well, I'll be talking
about markets, portfolio management, risk management, and you're going to
be there.
I'm not sure what you're talking about yet, but Adam will be there to give
us a presentation. And then, of course, we'll have a live Q&A as well.
So tickets are online. If you go to realinvestmentadvice.com, there's a banner
at the top of the page. You can get your tickets now. They're $99. The price
will go up here in the next week or so.
I was supposed to raise the price at the end of the year and I forgot. So if
you sign up pretty quickly, you're going to get a cheaper price. But tickets
right now are $99. Seating is very limited.
We've rented a hotel kind of conference room at Hotel Sinesta in Houston,
Texas. So we'd love for you to come.
We cannot record this due to copyright issues with Greg. So it's a live
event only. We'll obviously write about it after the fact.
But if you want to come see all the presentations and hear everybody and ask
questions and get fed, you'll have to come to the hotel in Houston to do that.
It's January 27th, which is the Saturday towards the end of the month. It
starts at 8 a.m. to noon.
All right. Awesome. And folks, if you're interested, I'll have a link in the
description below so you can click there and learn more about the event and
sign up if you want.
Not always that procrastinators get rewarded, but when the host is forgetful,
you get a window of opportunity there.
I know. I was on the beach. I forgot all about it.
All right. Well, look, I'm glad you got some time off for the holidays. Hope
they were good. Glad to hear that you were on the beach.
I was basically on my back in my sickbed from this supposed COVID that I've
had. Very nice to be on the side of it, got to say.
And I want to thank everybody for all the kind words of support and suggestions
on protocols I should be taking. And even those folks telling me that COVID
doesn't exist and it's totally made up.
Everybody was contacting me with generosity in their hearts, wishing me
well. And I really appreciate all that, folks. And I'm happy to say I'm back
into the light here, which is nice.
All right. Well, look, let's get into the activity of the week so far,
first week of the year. And market's kind of took it on the chin.
Just saw some stat. It was like the worst start for stocks in, I don't know,
20 years or something like that.
Now, Lance, you had been of late on this channel saying, "Hey, I think either
we're going to have some correction in the market going into the end of the
year because things had risen so quickly,
so fast, or that things just might grind sideways for an excessively prolonged
time and burn off the overbought readings that you've been flagging for us."
Is this just the pullback? It just took a little bit longer than you
thought? Or are you seeing anything that makes you think that this is a more
notable start for the year given the action?
No, no, really nothing shocking at all. Did you give me permission to
share? And we'll catch up on our chart that we usually kind of start the
show with.
Let's do it.
So, yeah, I mean, you know, this is really-- yes, look, lots of really
negative headlines out, Joe. So more start to a year since 1995 or whatever,
and of course, it brings-- it conjures up all kinds of, you know, things. But,
look, the markets went from extremely oversold in October.
We had this huge decline in August, September, October, which we talked
about back in June, July. You and I were talking about, hey, this-- we're
set up here for a 5% to 10% correction.
Markets are egregiously overbought, overoptimistic, so expect a correction. So
we had that correction in October. Everybody got exceedingly bearish.
And so you and I were talking to this like, hey, we're going to get this
year-end rally for a whole variety of reasons. One, extremely negative
sentiment. That's a contrarian signal.
You've got a lot of corporate share buybacks. By the way, we had a record
amount of corporate buybacks coming in to the markets over the last two
months of the year.
So we had this 15% rally from the-- kind of the October lows to the high
of December.
And about mid-December, you and I started talking about, hey, you know,
this market's really ahead of itself. We're going to get a correction. We're
close to triggering a sell signal.
And so as you can see, you know, on this chart, we did trigger our MACD
sell signal. And right on cue when that occurred, this market pulled back
a little bit.
All we've done is basically erase the Santa Claus rally. So now this is
going to be another headline you're going to see.
Oh, no. Santa Claus failed to visit Broad and Wall. Okay, so what's the
Santa Claus rally? Technically, that's the last five days of December,
the first two trading days of January.
The first two trading days of January wiped out that last five days of
December. So we had a negative return during the Santa Claus rally.
So immediately, this is also getting headlines. Oh, that means you're going
to have a bad year ahead. Hold on.
We also have to talk about the first five days of January, right? So the
first five days of January are the old Wall Street axioms.
So goes the first five days of January. So goes the month. So goes the
month. So goes the year.
So this is what we call the trifecta, right? This is what the markets are
all looking for or analysts are all looking for.
They're looking for a positive Santa Claus rally. That one failed. First
five days of January.
If we don't have a really strong rally, we're rallying a little bit on Friday,
but we've got to have a pretty decent rally on Monday too.
Monday's the last trading day of the five trading days of January.
If we don't get back to a positive number for January, that's going to be
the second part of the trifecta that fails.
Then theoretically, January should end in the red. And if that occurs,
now you start talking about statistically speaking,
you typically have a lower rate of return for the year when you have those
three things live up.
Now, having said all that, be careful with it because we're talking about
statistics, right?
The odds are that when you have the negative trifecta, there's about a 60
percent chance of a negative return for the year.
That means 40 percent chance that the market's higher. But then we start
talking about the presidential election cycle.
The fourth year of a presidential cycle is positive 78 percent of the time
with a 10 percent average return.
And we can just start going through all these statistics in a year that
follows a year where the market's up more than 20 percent.
Last year, the market was up 24.2 percent. So in a year that follows a year
that's up 20 percent or more,
the market is up 100 percent of the time, more than 10 or 15 percent or
whatever the numbers are.
But you'll see all these statistics out here trying to analyze and look back
in history and do all these things about what the outcomes are going to be
for the markets.
Here's the simple truth of it. About 85 percent of the time, the market's
higher.
That's just you know, you have about 85 percent of the time you have a bull
market, about 15 percent of the time you've got a bear market.
That's just the way markets work. Bear markets are generally pretty
vicious. They knock off 20, 25 percent of your index and then you're over
it pretty quick.
So the majority of the time the markets are rallying. And that's really just
what you kind of need to focus on.
Right now, there's nothing out there that suggests that what's going on
now is anything other than just a normal garden variety pullback from an
overbought condition.
And once we get if you take a look at the relative strength index at the
bottom of this chart, once that gets back to kind of oversold level,
I would be looking to put some money to work. In fact, we're holding some
cash and we're waiting for us to kind of work through this bit of cycle here,
get the markets oversold here a bit, and then we'll put some cash to work.
Okay. So this is sort of what you're saying. We're sort of right now in the
period that's kind of like the Wall Street's version of Groundhog Day.
Trying to see if he's going to see a shadow or not. Data is not fully in yet,
but obviously we'll be watching the early action next week,
because that'll show if the second part of the trifecta clicks down too,
and then of course we'll wait till the end of the month.
All right. And this will be interesting because it's sort of like whose kung
fu is stronger, right? The first couple of days of the year
or the presidential election or coming off of a 24% increase in the market
from last year, right? So it'll be kind of interesting.
But basically you're just saying, hey, look, right now it's all a tempest
in the teacup. You're just going to keep doing what you normally do.
It's not affecting your positioning strategy at this point.
And it shouldn't. Adam, if we're investors, we're positioning for a longer
term gain. I wouldn't let a couple of days kind of affect you.
Let's talk about what's happening here just at the end of last year and the
beginning of this year, just as another side point.
If as you do that, you can just talk about the sell signal, because I remember
asking about the pink dot two weeks ago and you were like,
oh, no, that's just something I put on there to highlight it. But you're
saying that's actually a sell signal that's on today's chart.
Yeah. So that that red circle top, we have a confirmed sell signal now.
So there's a couple of things that go behind our analysis that you can kind
of see back over here in June and July.
The MACD was waffling back and forth. And this is where we started talking
about potentially getting a sell off in the market.
But the market kept grinding higher. And the MACD indicator was just kind
of stuck at a very high level.
So we've got a couple of other indicators that we that we look at to confirm
when a sell signal is actually in place.
And so that never confirmed until early July. And then we begin to get
that correction.
We had the same thing kind of occurring in December when you and I started
talking about, hey, this market's really overdone.
We're close to getting a sell signal, probably going to get a correction
or consolidation.
That signal didn't confirm until just over the last five days of December.
But as we went into the last five days of December, you had a lot of
repositioning, portfolio rebalancing.
A lot of managers were kind of behind the curve in terms of getting allocation
on their books.
So that's why you saw a lot of that buying.
One of the reasons you're seeing a lot of selling right now is because
a lot of managers had a lot of big gains from last year, particularly in
technology companies.
So if they owned Nvidia or Apple or Microsoft and you're getting a lot of
headline rhetoric right now at the beginning of the year is like,
you know, oh, tech's just, you know, it's underperforming and Apple's falling
out of bed.
It's the end of the world. You know, it's now the China proxy and all this.
Be real careful with that. People had a massive ton of gains in these stocks
from last year.
They were overweight, these positions relative to the benchmark coming into
this year.
And as a portfolio manager, I want to sell my gains in early January because
I have to pay taxes on them until 2025.
If I sold them in December, I'd have to pay taxes on them in April.
So from a management standpoint, I do my set my tax off selling in December.
I do my capital gain selling in January because I can defer taxes that way.
That is really that makes a ton of sense.
Yeah. So so don't read a whole lot into the last few days as you know,
this is this is a sea change into the market.
You know, wait a month in over the next month or two.
I didn't even wait the first quarter, but over the course of this first
quarter, we're going to see if there's a rotation from the leaders of last
year to the laggards of last year or what the new what the new trends is
going to be this year.
Is it health care and REITs and and utilities over the mega cap stocks or
are we going to have continued disinflation?
Is it going to be the mega caps again because they can grow earnings in a
disinflationary environment?
We won't know that for a couple more months.
All right. So first off, Lance, well, you talk a lot about conditions getting
oversold, conditions getting overbought.
We used an analogy of the rubber band, an awful lot.
This is just sort of providing additional validation to that view of the
markets.
Right. Where if we look here at the bottom, the RSI chart, we're really the
MACD as well. They both got up to extremes.
You were saying as they were getting to extremes, these are these are
getting extremely.
And, you know, we expect there to be a pullback for the cyclical reason of
how markets go from one extreme to the other.
And that is indeed what's playing out here.
And we've seen this enough on enough of these weekly market recap, Lance,
to say, you know, this is a you know, it's not a crystal ball,
but it is a good probability indicator of when markets are going to reverse
in the near term.
And so this is just yet one more example of that happening.
All right. We can take the chart off the screen here.
But I do want to point out that I have had more guests than normal on this
program who have been pretty bullish.
And it's interesting. I've had people say, oh, Adam, now that you're on
Thoughtful Money, you know, you seem to be changing your tune.
You're bringing in all these bulls on. That's not the answer.
It's just that more of the people that I'm bringing on are bullish right now.
And again, that's the whole point of this channel is to bring in lots of
different analysts, lots of different people.
And I most of the time have no clue what they're going to say before they
come on the channel in terms of whether they're bearish or bullish.
And some of these folks were bearish and are now bullish. So I mean, that's
just what happens.
Just like the charts change, analysts, good analysts change as the data
changes and they revise their outlooks.
But I do want to call out that we've had folks like Michael Howell, who is,
you know, former Solomon Brothers guy from the old days,
very focused on liquidity. That's the framework that he looks at the world
through.
He is very bullish. He is basically expecting net liquidity to continue
rising for the next two years.
So he thinks both the economy and the markets are going to have a pretty
strong run for the next two years.
You've got guys like Darius Dale, who I think of as sort of a similar approach
to you, Lance, where it's just very much he's got his proprietary models.
He lets the data do the talking. Yes, he does keep macro stuff in mind, but
he really does his portfolio allocation largely based upon what his models
are telling him.
He has a shorter term, much shorter term outlook. He basically feels like
his model's headlights can illuminate like the next three months of the road.
I know you even look at a shorter timeframe, but he is very bullish. In fact,
he said about the most bullish he's ever been for the next three months here.
I've also had Simon White on the program, analyst from Bloomberg, who
basically said he sees right now markets continuing to go higher.
His framework is that inflation is going to become a problem again later on
this year, but he thinks markets are going to run until inflation reinserts
itself here.
So what's interesting is these people all kind of have different ways of
looking at the world, but that's the camp that's become decidedly bullish.
I want to mention that somebody who I would say is bearish overall, which
is Felix Zulauf, has said, and I had him on the program a month ago,
he thought that the markets were going to run hard through Q1, run hard to
the upside, and basically said the narrative is going to get really bullish.
The economy is going to look stronger than people thought it was, and we're
going to end Q1 on a high where everybody's going to finally believe we
have achieved
the immaculate no landing scenario. Then he expects the whole thing to
basically kind of come apart later on this year.
But what's interesting is we are seeing more analysts, at least more analysts
that come on this program, shifting to the bullish side of the story here.
I want to flag that just to give you a chance to react to that in any way,
because I know you, Lance, are constantly telling me to get too many bears
on the channel, and I'm getting all these emails from your folks, but
sentiment does seem to be crowding more onto the bullish side,
and I wonder, and you can answer this, but I wonder if that worries you,
because you tend to get worried with the consensus view.
Yeah, when you start pulling really bearish people back into the bull camp, I'm
going to really start getting worried because that's normally about the time
that contrarian investing works the best. When everybody finally capitulates
and says, "Fine, I thought there was going to be a recession."
I give up. There's not going to be a recession. We're going to grow at 5%. In
fact, I've got an article I'm going to be posting out next week.
I took a poll on Twitter, and it's a very interesting set of polls because
I did them one each day, so they weren't connected.
But I asked, "What's your view on real GDP? What's your view on
inflation? What's your view on interest rates?" And I gave ranges for this
coming year.
And it's interesting because all the poll respondents, and I've got a good
mix on my Twitter feed.
Probably if I took a poll and said, "Are you bullish or bearish?" It's
probably about 50/50.
It's not overly bearish. It's not overly bullish. But it was interesting
because there was no connection in the answers between what people thought
inflation would be versus where they thought interest rates would be, where
they thought economic growth would be.
In other words, they thought economic growth is going to be weak, but you're
going to have higher interest rates and stronger inflation, which those
can't live together.
It was very interesting to see the polls because what it tells you is it's
how people are being influenced by what they see in the media.
They hear all this stuff about inflation and interest rates and all that
negative commentary, and then they hear good news on the economy.
So their views are skewed by what they're actually hearing in the media,
but they're not tying them together into how things actually work in the
real economy.
So to your question specifically, yeah, there's nothing right now. Take a
look at the employment report on Friday.
There was nothing bearish really about that employment report. You had a
strong employment report, much, much stronger than expected.
Again, a lot of it seasonals, a lot of it's all apart. But just at the
headline, the number was stronger than expected.
And you would think that the markets would not like that because that means
the Fed's going to have to keep higher for longer.
This idea of six rate cuts by Wall Street next year is way overly optimistic,
and that's what this whole rally's been on is this whole idea that the Fed's
going to cut rates six times. They're not going to cut rates six times if
employment remains at 3.5%.
Yeah, I think we talked about this last time. The only way that I could see
the Fed cutting rates six times in 2024 is in panic.
And that's just not going to be a good environment for markets, I don't think.
Exactly. And look, that's the one big risk for this year is, look, I don't
think you're going to have another 20% year in the markets.
Look, anything's possible. We do have a tremendous amount of liquidity
coming into the markets. There's nothing that really says we're going to
have a recession right now.
Nothing that says we're going to have a recession. The deficit is
growing. You've got too much monetary liquidity being put into the system
for the economy to actually
contract hard, to have a hard negative recession. But there's certainly this
risk to the market that there is a disconnect between Wall Street's
expectations of six cuts and the Fed saying three. Those have to meet at
some point.
So in either case, it's going to require a 5 to 10% correction in the market
probably sooner than later.
So say maybe in the first half of the year, maybe by the end of summer,
that we have another 5 to 10% correction in the markets to try to realign
these views between three and six rate cuts.
That's coming. I just don't know when that's going to happen or what's going
to trigger it, but we've got to get those two views put back together again.
Yeah. And this is sort of the age old, and this is one of the reasons why
we're always talking about it. Don't let yourself get sort of waned around
by headlines in terms of how you do your investing.
But it's the age old price versus value story. You could have all sorts of
Goldilocks things happen in the economy over the rest of this year.
But if stocks are priced today for Goldilocks times three, they're too
expensive. So you can have the economy doing well while the market's correcting
if the market has unrealistic expectations right now.
A couple of quick things. One, just to give a little commercial, tomorrow's
video, the video that's releasing tomorrow, Sunday, is with Stephanie Pomboy
for any old fan favorite amongst the Thoughtful Money crowd for very good
reason.
So folks, we finally got Stephanie to come back. It was a great discussion,
just letting you know. And she has been in the deflation camp for a good
long while, and she's not taking herself out of the camp by any stretch.
But I think she is saying, "Hey, things are getting a lot more harder to
predict than I initially had expected." And on a number of issues, she's like,
"I don't know. I think I know how it should go, but given the way things
have been going recently, I don't feel as confident calling the ball on
certain elements going forward."
And so it's not a capitulation of a bear saying, "I'm jumping on the bull
train." But I think it is an example of a lot of people who were pretty hard
in the camp recession, camp, "Inflation has been broken, and now we're going
to reap the pain of the lag effect."
Saying, "Hell, I still run the calculations and the numbers come out the same,
but I'm just not as confident in the outcome because of a lot of these other
cross currents that have been going on that have been keeping this thing
part of the call for a lot longer."
So I do take that as a sign that if there's a correction coming, we're probably
closer to it than farther from it because some of the people that were really
further on the corrections coming page are, if not, capitulating or saying,
"Yeah, I get a hold of that a little more loosely now."
Yeah, and look, I mean, it's like with the HOPE framework, you and I talk
about a good bit.
Right, right, and the E just isn't cooperating with the outlook, right? And
this has been the problem, and employment's a really interesting one to look
at because the three most dangerous words in the market is, "This time is
different," right?
But in a lot of ways, this time is different because of what we did to the
economy by shutting down the economy. We laid off half the workforce, right?
If you actually look at job growth and the number of people we put back to
work, we're still below the previous trend of 2019, so we've never actually
been hired back, all the people that we laid off, not to even mention the
population growth.
So the problem with the E part of the HOPE framework and this whole idea of
recession, slowdown, and this is something you and I talked about probably
early last year, is that that shutdown has skewed so much of what would
normally work.
So when we take a look at these historical indicators, yield curves, leading
economic indicators, etc., they're all skewed because of that shutdown effect,
and we've actually never normalized that data to a degree.
It's going to take a long time to get back to a normal set of data that we
can look back and say, "Okay, now it's really telling us something about
the economy," and I think that's one thing that's really frustrating so
many people.
Leading economic indicators have been negative for 20 months in a row,
okay? Every time that's happened in the past, well, we've always had a
recession.
The difference this time is that leading economic indicators actually kind
of focus more on the manufacturing side of our economy, which is clearly in
recession, right?
So if you want to say that we're in a recession, you actually can. On the
manufacturing side of the indexes, you can see that clearly, you know, the
Fed, regional manufacturing indexes, ISM manufacturing index have all been
in contraction territory for a while.
This is very similar to what we saw back in 2012. We had a manufacturing
recession in the economy, but services never fell into recession, and services
make up about 80% of our economy.
So services right now are doing great. Why are services doing so well? Because
everybody has a lot of money, right? We gave people $5 trillion worth of
stimulus, all kinds of bailout packages.
Now they're working through that, right? They're working through all that
excess capital. They had paid off a lot of credit card debt, so they're now,
you know, starting to ramp up credit card debt, but that's giving them access
to spending.
And student loan payments that were supposed to start back in October,
there's like, I think, don't quote me on the percentage, but I think it's
like 40% of people that have student loan payments.
It is 40%. Yeah, it is 40%.
Yeah, they haven't made a payment in four months, right? So, you know,
my point is, and this is what you and I talked about before, Adam, is that
people are very crafty about finding ways to spend money, right?
And that's kind of keeping all this economic data skewed in a manner that
is keeping that recessionary drag from hitting the economy. That doesn't
mean it won't. It doesn't mean we won't be in a recession at some point,
but it could be 2025, right?
It could be 2026. I have no idea where that ultimate lag effect is going to
catch up. We know it's out there, Adam. We know it's there. We just don't
know when it actually kind of rolls over the other side of the cliff.
Yeah. God, you just mentioned like five points I want to follow up on. And
folks, if you like this part of the discussion, this is what Stephanie and
I go really deep into in tomorrow's video. So I look forward to that.
So I actually want to talk about today's job data, because if you do crack
open the hood, there's actually a fair amount not to like about it, which
we'll talk about in just a sec. But your point about the pandemic just sort
of shaking everything up, and we're still kind of watching how the dust is
settling, and it's obviously making a lot of things behave differently than
we would have expected otherwise.
A big factor of that. So first off, I should say, look, I agree with you
that the E in hope is the critical element. It's been the bulwark against
recession. And Stephanie and I talk a lot about this tomorrow. It's one of
the main things to be watching this year.
I think as the E goes, everything else is going to go. And what happened
during COVID was employers laid a bunch of folks off, and then they realized,
oh my God, it's really hard to get these people back.
And so we've had this talent hoarding that's been going on, certainly in big
tech, but in a lot of parts of the economy where they've just said, look,
I think we're going to make it through this.
And then now that they've gotten the green light from the Fed, they're
probably feeling like it was the right call to make, which is like, if I can
just keep these people employed, I'm going to save myself a lot of future
cost of trying to hire these people back when the economy recovers.
So I think employers have held more tightly to labor this cycle than they
have even as things were potentially getting pinched, even though profit
margins are still pretty much at record highs. So a key factor that's going
to happen here is whether that sentiment shifts or not.
So in other words, if the Fed is more slow in cutting rates, or if prices
and cost of capital don't recede as quickly as corporations are hoping,
and then we start getting the lag effect as corporate balance sheet debt
comes up for maturity and stuff like that,
if corporations get to the point where they're like, you know what, I've held
all these people as long as I can, but now conditions are such where I need
to start reducing my labor cost line so that I can keep my profit margins or
at least not get them squeezed as much as they're getting squeezed right now.
That will be the key thing to watch, I think.
No, absolutely. Look, at the end of the day, it comes down to earnings and
profitability, right? So, you know, for companies that have to meet Wall Street
expectations and look, earnings expectations for 2024 are very crazy high.
Yeah, 11% or something like that. Yeah, yeah, and maybe they'll get there. But,
you know, look, you just had a record amount, and I'm not talking about a
small record it was a huge jump in corporate buybacks.
And that's how companies reduce that, you know, per share part of the
equation when I'm looking at earnings per share. If I can reduce the shares
outstanding by doing buybacks that I can increase the E part right so you
know we're seeing a lot of that and that's
this year, as we look forward and again if you don't understand how share
buybacks have impacted the market from 2010 through 2021 ish right was when
we did the calculation.
And I haven't done it since but it's going to be roughly the same corporate
buybacks made up 40% of the net gains of the market over that timeframe they
made them almost 100% of the net purchases.
In other words, instead of the market being at 4500 or 4800 at the peak of
the market in January of 22, and then more like 2700. So, that's been the
contribution of the share buybacks of corporation buying shares pushing
prices of stocks higher.
That doesn't benefit you right other than if you own some shares of Apple
your price at your your Apple has prices gone up so that's been good. But
all that capital that was used to buy back those shares that was money that
could have been used to,
you know, buy, you know, expand their, their business create, you know,
whatever it is, Apple hasn't grown revenue in five years, six years now.
Right. So they've spent all this money buying back shares to make their
earnings per share look better but they're not increasing or growing their
business that's a problem.
And there's a finite ability to continue to do that long term but if you look
forward to this year. It is currently estimated that 100% of the net equity
purchases this year will come from corporate share buybacks and that's not
unusual we've seen this in recent
years as well. We've had this market kind of going up and further than what
economic growth can do and I actually have an article out today. Sorry,
yesterday, Saturday, Friday.
I actually have an article on the website talking about this and do you mind
if I share a couple of graphs real quick?
Yeah, please do. Is this from your article portfolio return expectations by
investors are too high?
Yeah, did you want to get to that in a minute? I can wait.
I do want to get to it. Let's flag it just for one second because I just
want to get to those employment numbers so we can hop off of it.
Okay, let me just finish my thought then. So the point is, is that earnings
and profitability can't outgrow the economy. So if the economy slows and all
of a sudden I have to start, you know, and my earnings and my profitability
start to decline
as a company, I'm going to protect that. How do I protect that? Well,
if I can't do corporate share buybacks, which are your small and mid cap
companies, if I can't do buybacks so I don't have the capital, then I've
got to look to employment.
If my earnings and profitability are being reduced because of a weaker
economic environment, even as a large cap company, I'm going to have to
start laying off workers looking to reduce that cost.
Why? Because healthcare benefits and employment are your three biggest costs
for any business, right? Your salaries, your healthcare, your benefits,
those are your biggest costs for any business.
So the best way to increase profitability is to reduce that cost.
So we've had multiple epic grants in the past that we won't rehash here,
but one is, you know, we've had pretty epic grants about buybacks and they're
largely, I think we both agree sort of net nefarious impact on what's going
on in the markets.
And also we've also railed about how what you're talking there about the
key costs for companies, right? Those are the human costs, right? We have
increasingly made it so expensive to employ humans, particularly humans
living in our country
that we have given just phenomenal, what I would call mal-incentives to
businesses to find ways to replace humans with cheaper humans in other
countries, automation, software, now AI obviously is a big threat in this
space.
And once those jobs go in any of those directions, they don't come back,
right? Once you invest in automation, you're not hiring the same amount of
employees you did in the future.
And that, you know, obviously leads to things like a hollowing out of
workforce opportunity for younger generations and all sorts of things.
Let me look at what's happening in California and other states where, you
know, they've done $22 an hour minimum wages and even states where, you
know, you raise minimum wages of $15, you know, there's a whole, you know,
there's a whole lot of research around that that shows
that the first thing that companies do is like, okay, great, if you're going
to hire, you know, hike the minimum wage and what people understand is that if
I hike the minimum wage to 15 bucks, you know, Adam was my regional manager,
he was making 15 and everybody else was at minimum at 750.
So now I've moved all the 750 to 15. I've now got to increase Adam's wage
to 20. Well, I had another guy, I had his manager at 20. So now I've got to
raise him to 25.
And so there's this trickle up effect when you start, you know, raising
those minimum wages and I don't want to get into all the arguments about
why we need to have a minimum wage, we need to have living wages.
Most of that's nonsense. But the fact is, is that ultimately at the end of
the day, businesses have to pay that wage, or they have to pass that price
on to consumers.
So either consumers get charged much higher prices, right, which they deal
with that inflationary impact, or corporations have to start figuring out
ways to reduce that cost of labor, which is, as you said, outsourcing it to
other countries hiring, you know,
cheaper offshore labor, automation, you know, AI is now going to be the new
way to increase productivity by using AI in business. That'll also be a big
impact into reducing that labor costs over time.
Yeah. And I can tell you right now, I mean, seeing this happen in California,
which has been at the vanguard of the hikes and, you know, wages. And again,
we're just seeing it right now with the fast food workers just got a pretty
massive raise.
And look, totally, we can totally have the living wage debate. But the outcome,
as you say, is both higher prices being passed to the consumer, and job cuts,
right, is we're going to have fewer people working more, right?
So okay, the employees that we retain are being, you know, perhaps treated
better on a per capita basis. But we are actually net employing fewer
people. So if you're trying to employ more people, in many ways, this sort
of works at odds to that.
Anyways, that's another rant for another day. Real quick, just getting to
the remaining part of the employment talk. So yes, we had the payroll data
came out this morning. Surprise to the upside, as you said, it was 216,000
jobs versus 175,000 was the expectation.
The unemployment rate was expected to tick up to 3.8%, but it actually stayed
flat at 3.7%. And, you know, so you're getting a lot of sort of celebrating
and chess beating of the headline.
But, you know, we've seen this movie before, right? You know, they dramatically
revised down the prior month's data. So today's beat, who knows, maybe it'll
be revised to a loss, you know, when the next month's data comes out.
But if you look under the hood, 676,000 people left the labor force,
right? And by the way, I'm taking these bullet points from a tweet that
Charles Payne sent out from Fox Business, you go on his channel, and I want
to make a comment about him in just a second.
So, you know, nearly 700,000 people, the labor force declined by almost
700,000 people, almost 700,000 people, 683,000 are employed, fewer people are
employed this month versus the prior month, that is a, in Charles's world,
a monster single month decline.
33,000 workers lost their temp job, over 22,000 workers lost their
transportation or warehousing job. As I mentioned, both October and November
payroll numbers were revised significantly lower.
And as you were saying earlier, the employment to population ratio dropped,
it's now at 60.1%. The pre-pandemic level was 61.1%. So when you just sort
of look, you know, you take a big step back and say, how are we doing?
We're actually doing worse than we were pre-pandemic in terms of employing
people. And even though it was a beat this month, when you look under the
hood, like I said, a lot of these stats is actually there's just fewer people
working in a lot of key parts of the economy.
And again, odds are not bad that today's beat might turn into a really
unimpressive number when it too gets revised. So when you look at the quits
data, that's been declining pretty substantially.
And there've been some relatively recent articles that are basically saying,
look, the great resignation is over. The power pendulum is shifting back
to employers.
And you've heard me joke about this many times on the channel that when the
great resignation started, I declared, pretty sure this movement is going
to morph into the great, please may I have my job back, sir movement.
And I think we are seeing the pendulum move now into that direction. So
all I'm saying here is that bulwark, that key rampart against recession is
showing some signs of stress here.
Where it goes from here, who knows, we're going to be tracking it every time
new data comes out in this channel. But it is looking more under siege at
the start of this year than it has, I think, on previous years of late.
It is. And look, the one thing that I track and nobody, I don't see anybody
else really track this, but this is the most important labor indicator for me.
Because in order to have benefits, right. So if I want health care benefits
if I want, you know, paid time off if I want parental leave. If I want all
these things right.
I don't get that as a part time employee, right. So the one thing that I look
at is full time employment because full time employment as a percentage of
the population.
I've got to have a full time job really in order to support my family if
I've got a full time job somewhere I've got benefits I've got probably a
decent salary, whatever it is, and I'm able to support my family of two or
three or four or 15, whatever.
But if you take a look at full time employment as a percentage of the
population. We never got back to where we were free pandemic.
And in fact we peaked just below that level, about six months ago and have
now turned low we've been turning lower on full time employment so full time
employment as a percentage of the labor force is already in a decline and
normally that's what you see
prior to recession now it's very early, but all the points you just made
about the labor force makeup is you can really see that much more clearly
when you take a look at full time employment as a percentage of the population
which again.
I've got to have a full time job to support a family and that in turn supports
the economy, you know, a bunch of part time labor doesn't do that.
Yeah, and I haven't looked at the full time stats recently enough to have
them right at the tip of my tongue but I know that kind of getting near the
end of 2023.
I remember seeing the data that suggested that there was almost no full time
job growth in 2023, that all job growth that had happened was part time.
Yeah, and you're seeing look you're seeing wages turn wage growth has turned
lower. That's why your quit rate is turning lower as well because those have
a very high correlation each other right makes sense right.
And the reason we have the great resignation is people are going hey you
don't want to pay me an extra dollar an hour I'm going to quit and go over
here and get a job for an extra dollar an hour.
All of a sudden, it's that opportunities no longer available so wages are
declining everywhere everybody's like, well, I may be able to quit my job
but I don't know if I can get a better paying job, right, I may just make
a lateral move here so that's
why you know again you're seeing all these things kind of line up and says,
we've probably reached the peak of the cycle of employment growth. And now
it's really going to come down to just how well the economy can hang in.
You know, over the course of the next, you know, six, eight, 12 months
now look again we've got a tremendous you don't got deficit spending is
surging. We've got the biggest increase in deficit spending since the pandemic.
You know the chips act inflation reduction act all that money that was in
those acts is just now really getting into the economy you know we're down
to build these plants in North Carolina and all this other stuff.
So this is going to help support economic growth longer than expected is
going to support employment growth longer than expected, but that money does
eventually run out. The question is now, and this is part of the article I
wrote on Friday.
It's not what's happening now it's what are you going to do for me next. And
that's going to be really the big question.
Yeah. Well, and you know, now that we're in an election year there's going
to be interesting to see, is there enough stuff they can do next to keep
the party going long enough to the, to the election itself in November,
a couple other quick stats here just
as I'd written down to you on the employment side of things. So Nick Timros,
the, you know, kind of the mouthpiece of the Fed, right? He just put this out
on Twitter, which I thought was interesting because it's a fairly negative
observation.
He said the latest revisions to payroll data show the US economy added just
44,000 private sector jobs in October. The three month average for private
sector hiring was 115,000 in December, matching the lowest level since the
economy reopened in 2020.
Right. So again, just showing that things are weakening, right, at least in
the private labor force. Now it was interesting, and I can't remember who
put this out there, is that government added an average of 56,000 jobs per
month in 2023.
More than double the average monthly gain of 23,000 in 2022. So to your point
about, look, you know, the government, the fiscal side is doing everything
it can to help out here.
Like, yeah, you know, jobs are getting lost in lots of other parts of the
economy. But the government's out there trying to say, look, you want a
job? Here you go. Just trying to keep the party going.
And maybe that's something we should seriously look at in terms of, you know,
doing government reform is, you know, all these people we hired to come work
with the government.
Yeah, well, you know, maybe we dig into that in the future, you know, kind of
the general topic of just like, really, let's dig into that deficit spending
and see what are we creating for ourselves here?
Is this creating net productive investment that we're going to benefit from
for a long time? Or is this just a lot of spending, just a window dress? Right.
So just real quick, back to the tweet of stats, I wrote about Charles Payne
there. You've been on Charles's program for years, Lance, and you know,
he's on Fox Business, a relatively mainstream, you know, business channel.
I've been noticing, you know, he seems to me to be sort of increasingly
critical. I don't want to necessarily use the term bearish, but increasingly
critical of the system. Have you noticed a similar shift?
No, this is one thing I have been doing. I've been doing a weekly appearance
with Charles now for quite a while, at least well over a year.
And one thing about him and look, out of all the people in financial media,
this is one thing I do respect about him. He is very bullish. He is always
bullish.
He's always optimistic. And you and I had this conversation, you know,
back in December about, you know, if you're going to be successful in life,
you have to be optimistic. You can't be pessimistic and be successful.
Those two just don't work together. So he's always optimistic. However,
he is also open to understanding the critical issues that go on and that
there are problems.
And he's willing to recognize those and say, hey, although I'm bullish on
the markets long term, I understand there are risks that can certainly impact
markets near term.
And that's one thing I really do respect about him. That's why I don't mind
doing a show because I can go on a show and be critical about a point and,
you know, not be afraid to get, you know, just, you know, kind of shoved
off stage like, oh, get this guy off. He's bearish.
And, you know, you can be bearish as long as you can be bearish with a good
reason. He will acknowledge the point. He may not agree with you. And that's,
you know, we can always have good debates, but he's very open to that.
So, yeah, you know, he has been a little bit more critical of some of the
data as of late because, again, you know, below the surface, there's problems.
And, you know, a lot of people, I get a lot of emails from your viewers,
it's like, Lance, why are you so uber bullish? And it's like, I'm not uber
bullish. I'm just understanding that right now, you've got a ton of momentum
in the markets.
But, you know, the stuff that, again, articles that are right on the website,
if you go to our website, lowinvestmentadvice.com, both Mike and I write
articles three times a week.
And a lot of them have a "bearish" tinge to them because we're looking at those
risks that can cause markets to have a correction and take away your capital.
And that's what you're trying to avoid is you're trying to avoid those big
massive drawdowns. You don't worry about 5% and 10% corrections. That's just
part of the deal.
But you do worry about the 20s, the 30s, the 40s, right? That's what you're
trying to avoid.
All right. So that's a great segue then now to talking about your recent
article. So titled "Portfolio return expectations by investors are too high."
And I think somebody would say, hey, that does have a bearish slant to it. So
walk us through your main thesis there.
Yeah. Well, you know, let me get the, so it's very interesting because over
this was, I was actually on the beach and I promised my wife I was not going
to write while I was on the beach.
But as usual, the best laid plans, right? It just never worked out because
I was perusing some articles.
And I found this article and it was a poll that was done by Statista, a
visual capitalist, that was looking at the investment return expectations
between financial advisors and investors.
Now, this is global, right? So they were looking at global people and they
had 8,550 investors, 2,700 advisors.
And if you focus on the US, there's a huge gap between what expectations
are by advisors, which are 7% returns in 2024 versus 15.6 for retail investors.
So retail investors have a very, very bullish view about returns in the
markets over the next year.
And so when you start thinking about that, you can say, well, that makes
complete sense.
That makes complete sense why investors have such a big gap because of what
they've experienced.
Just came off a 24% return year last year. So why is 15% so overly optimistic?
Well, that's when we started kind of digging down into some of the data in
the analysis.
And, you know, if you look back over the long term, go back to 1871.
The markets return on average about eight and a half percent a year.
Right. So now that doesn't mean now you've got to be careful about that.
That doesn't mean markets return eight and a half percent every single year.
The average return over that period is eight and a half percent.
That's including dividends. That's including inflation. That's real.
So there's, of course, very long periods of time where markets return zero.
In fact, if you take that that graph right there and you break it down into
the long term secular bulls and secular bears,
100% of the gains occurred in four periods over that history.
The other four periods had a negative return.
So, you know, that's why it's always important to understand valuations and
where you start investing,
because it has everything to do with where your long term returns are going
to be.
But having said that, you know, we start looking at, well, how did we
get there?
So we take those returns and let's break them down over periods.
And you're going to see something pop out at you that is a bit interesting.
So from 1928, so this data, the previous chart was using the Cape data from
Robert Shiller, which goes back to 1871.
If we go to Yale University, they produce total return analysis for stocks,
bonds and cash since 1928.
And so if we take those total returns and look at different periods, 1928
to 2023, the average return was 8.45%, right?
That's the eight and a half percent we were just talking about. Completely
what you would expect.
That's completely accurate based on that. It's also what you should expect
as well.
The economy grows at about six percent on average, going back to 1900.
Your dividends have run about four percent.
So there's your 10 and then your inflation rate has been about two and a half.
So subtract two and a half from from 10. And, you know, you're seven and a
half percent.
So you're right where you would be based on earnings growth and and economic
growth.
Now, look at 1928 to 1999, nine and a quarter percent.
So we we just stripped out everything post 2000.
So we just stripped out the dot com crash, all that.
So if you strip all that out, 1928 to 1999, still close to the average,
but a little bit better. 1973 to 2023.
So let's just start at the beginning.
And these are just arbitrary dates just to look at some different periods
throughout history of where you started.
Right. 1973, very low valuations through 2023.
You averaged about eight percent. Now take a look at the next data here.
2009. So as the financial crisis to present twelve point one three percent
on a total return basis.
That's for almost four full percentage points higher than the long term
average of 1928 to twenty three.
2012 to twenty three. Twelve point two six percent.
2017 to twenty three. Twelve percent is 11.5 percent.
So we've had these excessive rate of returns, rate of returns ever since
the financial crisis.
And because of that, it's not surprising that investors have now gotten
trained to expect these much higher rates of return than what the economy
can actually generate over a long term timeframe.
Right. And so this is just a classic case of recency bias where, well,
this is what we're used to.
Right. Yes. It's what we're used to. But now you have to ask the question,
well, how did we get these rates of return?
Right. So if the economy is only growing at two percent, inflation is two
percent, then your stock market return should be somewhere around two percent
plus dividends.
Right. So say four percent. It shouldn't be 12 because that doesn't the
economy can only generate so much in earnings.
And that's the economic activity that you and me going out of one of the
movies, one of the grocery store.
We're doing those type of things. That's economic activity. And that's where
revenues and sales come from.
So how do we get to 12? Well, there's there's two things. And this is and
again, this is what I was just talking about.
So if you look at the earnings per share growth going back to nineteen forty
seven and this is all off read, so you could do this work yourself.
But that's average rate of churn is about seven point seventy two percent. So
earnings have grown at about seven point seven percent.
Year over year S&P growth has been about nine percent over that time
frame. This is including this is including all the post 2008 financial crisis
boost as well.
The twenty four point one two percent last year also.
So you've had a you've had nine percent growth, seven percent in EPS growth
and the economy grew at six point three nine percent annually.
So there's a very close correlation, but the market's growing faster than
earnings and the economy.
So how is that happening? And this is where we start talking about the drivers.
One of those has been buybacks. If you just take a look at stock buybacks
post the financial crisis, there's been a huge surge.
And in fact, you know, 2021, we had a just a phenomenal surge in corporate
buybacks.
And now we're back on that run again for corporate share buybacks now as well.
But the corporate share buybacks, as we were talking about, has been a big
driver since 2010 for the S&P index in particular.
Can I ask a question about that? Just head back for one sec. So totally get
starting at two thousand.
What happened at 2010? Right. QE and all the, you know, incredible stimulus
and rock bottom interest rates.
Right. So you could borrow basically at super cheap rates to buy your
stock back.
Right. And we saw a lot of companies do that. Apple issued five, five billion
in bonds to buy back shares.
Yeah. Which makes total sense. I get you're a CFO. Right. You can retire
more expensive stock with super cheap debt.
Go for it. Right. We're not in that environment right now, though. So what
is funding the buybacks that have been happening recently,
given that the cost of capital is so much higher now?
You have to look at the balance sheet of, say, Apple, which has like one
hundred and thirty billion in cash.
So is that primarily driven by the guys with fat balance sheets and they
just sitting there? OK.
Yeah, yeah. Most of your buybacks. I mean, you know, when you hear these
companies announce buybacks, you know, you don't hear
Stanley Black and Decker, which is a mid cap company. They don't come out
and go, oh, we're going to do five, you know,
20 billion in buybacks this year. They still have that much capital. But,
you know, you hear companies like Apple or Microsoft.
Yeah, we're going to increase our buybacks this year by another 10 billion
dollars because they've got a shit ton of, sorry,
they've got just a ton of cash on their balance sheets and they refinance
most of their debt at zero.
So they have very low interest rate costs on their books and they don't have
any refinancing risk here in the near term.
So they can use that cash to buy back shares to prop their EPS.
OK, so it's just basically fat treasuries that they're just taking cash out of.
But now we also have to look at the other big driver here, which has been
the amount of money that we've spent on corporate government intervention.
So if you take a look at everything starting in 2008, we did the
infrastructure, 800 billion dollar infrastructure deal in 2008.
Then we did HAMP, TARP, cash for clunkers, cash for appliances, quantitative
easing part one, part two, part three, Operation Twist, quantitative easing
part four.
You just go on and on and on with the pandemic stimulus. We've injected
forty three trillion dollars of capital into the economy and the financial
markets for a net growth of only five point seven trillion dollars worth of
economic growth.
So over that same period, we spent roughly almost five dollars to one dollar
worth of economic growth over the course and that's all been debt financed.
So there's just so much fuel that's been put into the economy and you can
see this, I mean, as we did more and more of this, the stock market just
continued to rise.
And if we take a look at the correlation, so this is the cumulative change
in government interventions versus the stock market.
You've got a 75 percent correlation. So the more they did financial
interventions, the more the stock market rose.
So between corporate share buybacks and government money coming in, in both
terms of the Fed buybacks, as well as government monetary interventions,
it's no wonder that the market has generated 12 percent rates of return
every year.
And this is why investors now expect 15 going forward, because they keep
expecting us.
And the question that we have to ask ourselves is that when you look at the
deviation of the markets from its long term growth trend,
just both in price and on valuation, we have very big deviations that were
driven by all this monetary stimulus.
So the question becomes, is with you running a two trillion dollar deficit
and growing and there's no real crisis at hand at the moment.
You don't have another financial crisis. Where's the next massive round of
money going to come from?
I mean, you've got to have the government needs a reason to do another five
trillion in spending.
The Fed needs a reason to do quantitative easing. So until something breaks,
there's really no incentive for and really no ability for the government to
just come in and say,
oh, you know, we just felt good today. We just thought we'd send checks to
households again. That's going to be the real risk for investors over the
next couple of years,
is a lack of money to the same degree to support the earnings and economic
growth that as we started this conversation out.
When you're expecting 11, 12, 13, 14 percent rates of earnings growth this
year, you've got to ask yourself where it's going to come from.
Yeah. This is why I've been having discussions recently about liquidity and
whatnot, trying to find all the inputs that are going into the system,
because to a certain extent what you're saying is, look, we have artificially
propped up the system for the past decade plus in a way that we'd never done
it before.
And so if you as an investor are going to go with recency bias and say, okay,
I'm going to expect the same type of returns going forward for the next decade
that I had over the last decade, that assumption is really predicated on
all the artificial support that we had continuing.
And who knows, maybe needing to continue at a higher level because of
diminishing returns and that type of stuff. I don't know if that's necessarily
going to be the case,
but I've heard people make the argument for it. So yeah, I think that is
the key question you've got to ask yourself if you are saying,
look, I want a portfolio that returns double digit returns annually for the
next 10 years.
Yeah. And again, markets just don't do that to start with, but expectation. And
again, I get lots of emails from who's like,
if I can just make 15 percent a year of my money, I'll be good. It's like,
well, so will I.
Well, hey, if you know that, tell me, because I'm signing up for it.
Yeah. And we turn away a tremendous amount of people just on the basis that
their expectations are not real.
And there's just a big mismatch between what a portfolio can actually generate
versus what actually happens versus expectations.
And with expectations so skewed, the risk is, is that investors are going
to take way too much risk
and they're going to pay a heavy penalty that's going to ruin them financially
when things start to revert back to just normal.
And again, you know, I'm not saying that markets are going to have a big
major crash.
All I'm saying is if returns go from 12 percent on average back to eight,
people are going to feel very disappointed.
Man, this market sucks. I'm only generating six percent a year. This is
terrible. Now that's what the market should generate.
But because you're so used to these outsized rates of return, you're going
to take on way too much risk.
And ultimately, you're going to wind up getting yourself in a real problem
down the road.
Yeah. And I want to revisit a comment you've made in the past, which is you
shouldn't look to the stock market to make you rich.
You should look to the stock market as a way to keep the value of your wealth
on pace with inflation.
Now, you know, maybe over time, over long enough times, you can put enough
of the magic compounding to you that you might even be able to
grow your wealth in real terms over a long period of time. But that shouldn't
be necessarily the main requirement of it.
Right. And obviously, the less heavy lifting you need the market to do,
the easier it's going to be to hit your financial returns.
Right. And so what I mean by that is, you know, if you want to grow your
wealth by 15 percent a year, there are better,
more time proven ways to do that. You and I have talked about how, you know,
you can do that in business by starting a business.
And yes, there's risk in entrepreneurship, and I don't want to discount any
of that type of stuff. Right.
But if you are taking calculated bets in the areas in which you have developed
professional skills and will have the ability to improve
your professional skills over time, you can actually increase the odds of
your success.
And as I know, we've talked many times on this channel, but feel free to
reiterate it here.
I imagine the bigger accounts that come to you, the people that say, hey,
Lance, I've got a bunch of money and I want you to help manage it for me.
Most of those people got their bunch of money through a business.
Right. A hundred percent. Yeah, it's either there's a there's a few there
are inheritances.
Right. You know, my dad died, left me a big load of money. That's those are
very rare. Right.
The vast majority of people that come to us that have a large chunk of money
and I'm talking about, say, in excess of four million dollars.
Right. All came from their business owner. They sold the business. They had
some transaction that occurred.
There's a lot of people I don't want to discount the value of working for
a company.
We have a lot of we have a lot of clients that have two, three million
dollars saved up because they've worked for ExxonMobil for thirty five years.
And they were investing in ExxonMobil stock in 1970, and they were contributing
to their, you know, their pension that they had.
And it was getting matched. And, you know, and they but but but they were
very frugal.
They lived far below their means. They were saving 30 and 40 percent of
their money every year.
And then they drove a 30 year old pickup truck that had a door falling off
of it, that type of thing.
But they were just heavy savers and they and they worked for the same job
for 30, 35 years.
And like you said, they had their pension plan, they had their 401k, they
invest in companies, their companies stock and they did very, very well
for themselves.
That's another decent chunk of people. But by and large, the wealth has
always been generated by people who go out,
they start a business and then they have a transactional event on that
business at some point.
Right. And the point I'm trying to make here is instead of saying instead
of thinking I have to put all my eggs into the market basket
and I got to really cross my fingers that the market's going to give me
recent historic returns, right, to hit my goals going forward.
You know, much more, I think, intelligent and much more, you know, likelihood
of success is to sit down, you know, with a financial planner or at least
if you're good at doing this yourself,
you know, the projection software and sit down and build the financial plan
that says, hey, look, what can I do, you know, with the assets I have here
in terms of its job with a good company? Okay, great. If I'm frugal and
really sock stuff away, what can I expect to get from that?
Maybe my spouse, you know, what are they getting rather from their job or
if one of us starts a business, right?
You know, what do we think that can drive for us over time? And then say,
okay, with the delta we have,
how much heavy lifting does the market have to do for us for that? And if
you can get that heavy lifting requirement down to the historic average
or even less, well, then geez, you know, your odds of hitting your goals go
up, but also anything the market does that surprises to the upside
is just gravy. It just helps you cross the finish line sooner, right? And
that way you get pleasantly surprised versus having higher odds of getting
disappointed
of like, oh my God, I needed the market to do X and it didn't and I had all
my eggs in that basket.
Yeah, no, and again, it's always very fascinating to me because, you know,
people that come to us that have a lot of money,
they're like, I don't want to lose money. I don't really care if I make
money. It'd be great if I made some money.
I just don't want to lose money. And that's because they took all their risk
in their business and they knew all that risk that they took
to generate that nest egg that they actually built when they had their
transactional event at some point.
I worked 25 years in this business. I've made it. Don't lose it, right? That's
the whole focus.
Birth is the other group of people that, you know, you take a look at those
that spend too much,
don't save enough, you know, don't have good budgetary controls at home. They
don't have the ability,
they don't have the cash flow at home to contribute to their savings really
of anything else.
And so they've got this little bit of money over there like, look, I just
want to be as aggressive as possible to make this 50 grand turn into 10
million dollars by the time I retire.
And that's just not realistic. That's just not going to happen. And
unfortunately, the media drives that type of mentality is, you know,
oh, you just got to invest in stocks and stocks will make you wealthy. There
is very little evidence that that is actually truly the case.
You know, people that made money investing generally made money investing
for other people. There are a few people that did invest their way to wealth.
They got lucky. They hit the one stock that was Apple at two dollars a share
and they bought it and it went up and they made a million dollars or whatever
it was.
That's a rarity thing. We saw a lot of that happen with Bitcoin, right? When
Bitcoin had its big run.
We saw the Bitcoin millionaires and then we saw the Bitcoin millionaires
turn into Bitcoin broke over the next couple of years.
You know, and that happens all the time. Markets are great about giving you
wealth and then taking it all away.
So paying those expectations, you know, like you said, you know, Adam,
sit down, say, look, I'm saving this much a month.
If I can plan it out, if I can just get four percent a year, where does that
put me? And if that's not to my goal, then I don't increase my return rate.
That's that's not what you don't go, well, what if I get six, right? What
if I get eight on my return? Then all of a sudden, oh, look, if I got 10
percent a year, I hit my number.
OK, that's what I must shoot for. Well, if you think about it, if I go
from just a four percent rate of return to a five percent rate of return,
I increase my return by 25 percent.
But that's almost 100 percent increase in the amount of risk that you've
got to take for just that one percentage point of annual return.
So the odds are when something breaks, it's going to wipe out everything
that you just did.
So instead of upping your rate of return, up your savings.
So at four percent, I need to save an extra hundred dollars a month or at
four percent, I need to save an extra two hundred dollars a month to get to
that goal.
Or I need to go for another five years, work on the variables you can control
and underweight the risk of growth in that plan.
And you will by far and away exceed your expectations. Great point. Last part
about this, when you talk about the successful people that come in and say,
look, I worked really hard to earn this money.
Don't lose it on me. Totally get it. There's a lot of embedded investment
of their life and those funds are headed to you.
But I think there's also a recognizance of, hey, when I was an entrepreneur
running my business, I could largely control my risk.
I could influence the situation. Once I hand that money to the markets,
I can't control it. I can't control what the S&P does here.
So I think, again, just a strong sense of having an appreciation for where
you can control the destiny of your money a lot better in certain of these
buckets than others.
So again, to your point, you put it in the market bucket, you've got to
really be honest that as much as I want it to be 10% every year, I better
plan more on the averages versus the outliers.
Okay, so we're getting near the end here. Trying to determine if there's
time to squeeze a rant in here. Maybe we will. Before we get to that, though.
We had a couple of rants from last year we never got to. I know, and they're
here. But before we get there, just to make sure I scratch the itch for folks,
two things.
One, just very quickly, I want to get your update on bonds. Let me just give
you two different people's perceptions. I would say bonds are one of those
topics right now where the folks I talked to were kind of all over the map.
We got some folks that are super bullish, some folks that are super
bearish. Two recent people I talked to, one was Alf Pecatiello, who is a
bond analyst.
He thinks this year is going to be a really big year for bonds. And if you
want to find out why, folks, you can go watch that interview with Alf.
I then interviewed Kevin Muir from The Macro Tourist, which, Lance, I don't
know if he's on your radar much. He's a great guy. I'm so glad to have added
him into the faculty of folks that come on the channel now.
But Kevin, he thinks that bonds will probably do pretty well this year. He's
not like a raging bond bull, but the reason why he is more positive on them
is because of how overvalued stocks became in 2023.
When you look at the equity risk premium versus bonds, he's just saying
that a lot of portfolio managers are going to say, you know what, now that
inflation is coming down, and one of the things Alf talked about was as
inflation gets above a certain level,
the inverse correlation between stocks and bonds go away. So now that they
become much more positively correlated, so now that inflation is coming down,
it sounds like you disagree with that.
But his thesis is now that they're coming down, you have a lot of capital
managers who are like, oh, hey, bonds can actually be the ballast in the
portfolio that I need them to be now.
But anyways, for that and similar reasons, Kevin is thinking that, hey,
bonds are just going to provide a better risk adjusted return going forward,
and therefore, it's just going to start siphoning capital from stocks.
So what are you guys thinking? Has your investment thesis changed at all
for this year and react to any of those two other speakers I just mentioned?
I'll keep my mouth shut on the other two, but the bottom line is that, no,
our thesis hasn't changed at all. As I said back in December, expect interest
rates to go back up here near term.
They got that big fall we had in interest rates. Bonds got extremely overbought
along with stocks. Correlations between stocks and bonds have been -- stocks
and bonds have been very correlated since the turn of the century, by the way.
The non-correlation of stocks and bonds occurred before the Fed became active
prior to Alan Greenspan. We've done the analysis on that before.
But so the correlation of stocks and bonds is still there. And bonds as a
function are a function of interest rates -- sorry, a function of economic
growth and inflation.
So if you believe that economic growth is going to slow down, and you believe
that -- this is what I was saying about the poll, the poll that I took on
Twitter from people.
There's a disconnect between their views on the economy, the markets and
everything else. And there can't be. They're all interrelated. They're
all connected.
So if you're expecting economic growth to slow down, if you're expecting
inflation to head towards 2% as the Fed is, then interest rates are going
to track that as well.
And look, right now, economic growth -- do the math, right? Economic growth
in the third quarter was 4.9%. In the fourth quarter, we're probably going
to take off somewhere close to three.
So just kind of run that down. Just say that's roughly about 4% spread
between the two. And that's where interest rates are.
So inflation's at 3%, 3.3%, 3.2%. So interest rates are a little bit overvalued
right now based on where inflation and economic growth is.
That's going to continue to realign itself this year. So no, the bond thesis
still holds up.
I told you back in November where it was, I trimmed off a little bit of our
bond portfolio, but I've been waiting for rates to come back up here.
That's been happening over the last week or so with this correction in the
markets, bonds are correcting.
So we'll add that back on, that money back into the bond portfolio here in
the next two, three weeks where we get the opportunity.
What level of tenure makes you interested in doing that?
Well, again, I get this question a lot, like, "What's the number?" There's
no number. It's just when the technicals get to oversold.
And interest rates could just kind of be flatlined for a period of a month
at 4% and get us to those oversold conditions and make that a great buying
opportunity.
Or they could go to 4.5% very quickly and make that a great buying
opportunity. So trying to pick some number and say that's the target, that's
where everybody goes.
This is why investors consistently do poorly in the markets. They go, "Well,
if the stock market gets to this number, I'm going to buy it."
Never buy a specific house in a neighborhood. Buy the neighborhood. If I
get into the front entrance of the neighborhood, I'm going to start buying.
Because that's where you're trying to get to the neighborhood. You're not
trying to get to the specific address.
And what happens with investors, they say, "Well, if interest rates get to
4.5%, I'll buy it or four and a quarter, whatever it is."
Interest rates never get there and they never buy because it never got to
that number. If you get to the neighborhood, you buy a little bit.
You get further into the neighborhood, you buy a little bit more. If you
get to the specific house, you buy a lot.
But that's just how you manage that portfolio. So again, I don't know what
that specific yield is, but we'll know in the next two, three weeks.
You'll look at it in the context of the technicals.
Yes. When we get to the neighborhood, I'll tell you that we bought some
more bonds.
All right, great. And then your trades. Have you made any trades since the
start of the year?
Yeah, yeah. Since the start of the year.
For two years, two weeks, because it's been two weeks.
We added, so right towards the end of the year, oil prices kind of bottomed
and started looking a little bit better on a technical basis.
So we added a company, we already owned ExxonMobil in our portfolio, so we
added a little bit of Diamondback drilling to our portfolio.
Symbol's FA and G. And that's done very well so far. And we like that kind
of space.
Got a good dividend yield. And we think Energy will continue to do well here
over the next few months anyway.
Especially if we start seeing some more rotation in the markets as well. Energy
should continue to do OK in that space.
We also just added some starter position. Eli Lilly and UnitedHealthcare.
We had sold a big chunk of our health care last year for tax loss selling.
So we're starting to rebuild our health care sector a little bit. So we added,
like I said, we started a position.
Eli Lilly, of course, those are the big participants in the GOP drugs for
weight loss.
They just announced that they're going to start selling direct to consumer.
One of the beneficiaries of that is going to be CVS, which is the kind of
your neighborhood pharmacies.
So you'll be able to go to CVS and get your GOP weight loss drug at some point.
We did sell CVS last year because of tax loss selling reasons.
We will be buying that one back. We're just waiting for that one to correct.
Did you sell out of CVS or did you just sell down?
No, no. We closed out the position last year.
Because I know you've talked positively about it.
No, no, no. We love the stock long term. And unfortunately, we had to wait
30 days.
And in a 30-day period, it ran back a little bit. That happens sometimes,
but we didn't want to violate the tax loss rule.
So as soon as we get a little bit of a pullback here and we'll get that at
some point, we'll add CVS back to our portfolio.
But yeah, we really like that company long term. Fundamentals are great. Trades
at a price to sales of 0.3 has a very nice dividend yield.
So yeah, no reason to not want to own the company.
Okay. All right. Well, look, I am going to try to squeeze in our rant here,
at least one of them, one of the three I had on here.
And then we'll start to wrap things up.
So I can't remember, because it's been so long now, what specific trigger
made me put this on here.
But I found since I've been trying to have this rant with you, I've had it
with many others.
So first background, I'm from a family of doctors. I've got a brother who's
a child psychiatrist.
My wife is a therapist. My sister-in-law is a psychiatric nurse.
So in addition to just the medical profession, the mental health profession,
I've got a lot of representation in my life.
And I think most of the folks in my family would agree with this comment,
which is it's probably not shocking to say that we probably over-diagnose
and over-prescribe mental health issues.
And look, I'm a huge fan of the fact that mental health is finally getting
attention.
When I was growing up, if you went to a therapist, it meant you were crazy.
I completely acknowledge the immense benefits that therapy can provide,
just like you have a personal trainer for your physical body, having one
for your emotional health is, I think, a great idea.
But I think we totally over-diagnose and we've created all these conditions
that I don't think existed in previous generations.
Like I have anxiety and therefore I can't do X. If you're a parent of
millennials or Gen Z, you probably hear that all the time from your kids.
And my point is we have this sort of epidemic of depression and anxiety in
this country that has sort of become accepted,
again, as reasons to not lean into life or to not do things.
And I don't want to be dismissive of people that have true mental health issues
that could be chemical in nature or could be due to severe trauma or whatnot.
But we've, A, let it become a rationale for not leaning into life.
And secondly, I think what it has done is given people sort of an excuse
not to try and to sort of justify where they are in life.
And where I'm going with this is, especially with kids, they weave this into
their sense of identity way more than adults.
If an adult or a doctor tells them, oh, you're depressed or whatever, they
just accept, oh, I guess I am a depressive person and therefore I'm going
to act like one.
And taking a long way to get into this, Lance, but I feel like in so many
ways that this is just, in many cases, conditional.
And what instead we need is basically just basically like productive action.
Just learn that actually, no matter how you feel, you can take constructive
control of your destiny.
You have agency to improve your situation, both how you feel and how the
world reacts around you.
And this just goes back to kind of the hard work that you and I talk a lot
about, which is sort of the path to progress.
This is the like, I can't remember the guy, the admiral that was famous for
the speech where he said, look, the first thing you do when you get up in
the morning is make your bed.
That way, before anything else has happened in the day, you've got a
demonstrable accomplishment that you've made, that you can see that you've
done, and it sets the momentum for the rest of your day.
We talked, I think, a little bit about this guy, the guy who wrote the book
Atomic Habits.
And he called the book Atomic Habits because he was trying to break it down
into the smallest things that you could do to begin to give you some positive
forward momentum in your life.
And I think one of the main reasons why so many folks are depressed is because
they don't have any accomplishments in the day that they can point to and say,
oh, I created value today,
and therefore I have value, and therefore I can feel good about myself,
and therefore maybe I want to invest more in myself so that tomorrow I can
create some more value.
So I'll take a breath here, but the key thing here is if you want results,
they only come from action.
And the Atomic Habits guy says, what you want to do is you want to start
the behavior.
He said liking it, enjoying it, maybe getting fulfillment from it will come,
but it's probably not going to be there at first.
So you've got to just start adapting the behavior of somebody who is productive
and successful, and over time you will start to see the results and you will
start to enjoy that,
and then you'll likely actually start to like the action a lot more, and
then eventually it becomes a habit that you value in your life.
But a lot of this stuff didn't feel good at first. It's not as fun as lying
on the couch, but the benefits that come from it all
are outsized compared to just maintaining the status quo of the never changing
and what might be very depressed or fearful existence.
So I'll take my breath here, but this is something I was like, I know Lance
is going to have really strong opinions on this given your wiring.
Yeah. I've been through some really tough times in my life.
We've had events that have happened with business and other things, and it's
important that you have a resource to go to, to talk through things.
So for some people, it's just a really good friend. You can go to a really
good friend and say, look, this is where I am.
And it's important that the feedback that you get is open and honest and
supportive.
But you also don't want coddling either. And this is one of the issues you
want to make sure is that when you're reaching out for help.
And look, I encourage you to reach out for help. You can't do any of this
alone.
And if anything will teach you that it's trying to run a business by yourself,
it is very, very complicated.
And so trying to do anything by yourself is always difficult.
But the thing that you want to make sure and get is feedback that is not
only supportive, but also critical and saying, look, you're screwing up.
You keep doing this and you're going to wind up out of business or you're
not going to wind up getting where you want to go.
And sometimes that tough love is what you need, but you just don't want to
hear it.
And one thing that and this is one of my problems with where we've gotten
to today is everybody's so afraid of offending somebody else.
It's like, no matter what, I don't want to say that to Adam because I might
offend him because everybody just gets offended at the drop.
But let me tell you something. Being offended is a good way to get yourself
going.
Right. Because if you're getting offended for some reason, it's probably
because of a weakness in you that is keeping you from achieving a better
position in life.
And you've got to, as they say, you have to face your fears or whatever it is.
Sometimes facing whatever it is that's offending you is the hardest thing
to do and to be able to say.
Yeah, that's a flaw. And I need to fix that. I need to work on that. Right. And
then start figuring out how and maybe that's getting help from somebody else
to work on whatever that weakness is.
But it's true in sports. It's true in business. It's true in life in general.
And the problem where we are today is, is that we cater to being soft and
we support people being soft in nature.
And it's like, "Oh, well, I don't want to offend him or her or whatever
because of their actions. I don't want to hurt their feelings."
But sometimes that's what it takes us to move ahead.
So that's why I really brought this up. And there's a lot here that we as
individuals can learn and apply to ourselves here.
But we're parents. I think a lot of people who watch this channel are
parents. You and I have talked in the past about one of the kindest things
you can do for your kids to make them lead happy, productive, successful
lives is to allow them to deal with adversity.
To not step in and shield or coddle or protect. That it's by them learning
how to overcome adversity that they develop self-confidence and they develop
the skills that will make them successful.
But because we do have a helicopter society right now and hey, no parent
likes to see their kids struggle.
But because we also have this fear as you're talking about of telling
anything negative to anybody and we now have these medical conditions of,
"Oh, well, your teenager has depression."
And you don't want to make them feel more depressed because God forbid they
might do something really extreme.
Parents are obviously understandably really fearful of doing that. But it's
like to not push and prod and encourage and deliver the tough love and the
constructive criticism.
In many cases is doing your kid a much longer disservice in life. And so
I've sort of been wrestling with this about even talking about this because
I'm sure there's going to be some blowback from people who say, "Oh, gosh,
I couldn't possibly do that."
And you're being cruel to people with mental health diagnoses and I'm not
trying to get into that space at all.
But I'm just saying we have made this over-diagnosis of this person's
uncomfortable and therefore they're checking out of life as this thing
that needs to be protected and even though we're watching those people in
many cases sort of spiral downwards into a person who's just unhappy with
themselves because they're looking around at life.
Certainly looking at social media and seeing the people that are having
wonderful lives and they're not doing anything because they're sitting there
and they're angst and they're depression.
I do worry that we are kind of relegating a much larger percentage of our
young population than we ever did in previous generations to this protected
cage of depression.
Yeah. Well, no, and it's not just depression. I mean, there's so many
different things. I'll give you an example. My daughter's dyslexic.
And she struggles with it, right? And so she has a choice. She could literally
just cop out and say, "I'm dyslexic so I'm just going to take it."
Why try?
Yeah, why try, right? I can't do it. The one thing that I admire about her,
and this is the way she was raised, is she's got a very strong personality.
And so my motivation for her, it's very easy for me. I figured this out a
long time ago with her, is that she'll go to do something and she'll fail.
And I go, "Why are you even trying to? You can't do that. You know, you've
got dyslexia. You can't do that."
And that's her trigger. Because mentally, a light switch goes on. She goes,
"Oh, yeah, I'm going to prove to you that I can do this."
And she goes out and she gets it done, right? But that's her trigger,
whatever that trigger is.
But for most people, right, if you say that out in public, it's like if you
went after her and said, "Oh, you can't do that because of your issue,"
then it's like, "Oh, you're just being mean and cruel to her." Well, yeah,
I was being mean and it hurt her feelings at the time when I did it, right?
I wasn't shielding her. I was like, "Yeah, people like you can't do that." And
then she goes, "Oh, yeah, well, I'm going to prove to you I'm the person
that can."
And she goes out and does it. And that's what motivates her, right? That's
her personality.
And it took me a while to learn that with her. But even to today, she goes
to college. She's doing great in college.
And she has access to dyslexic programs at college, right? With universities,
they have these dyslexic programs that let you take your test by yourself.
And they give you extra points because you're dyslexic and all. She does
none of that. She doesn't want the special treatment.
She says she doesn't need the special treatment and she's going to be normal
in her mind like every other kid in class. And that's her, right?
And so the point is, is that we are so quick on social media and in life. You
take a small child and he's hyperactive, right?
You give him a whole bunch of sugar and he runs around like crazy. "Oh,
well, he's obviously got ADHD, so now I got to go put him on Ritalin," right?
Well, maybe it's his diet. Maybe he's just getting too much sugar in his
diet. Maybe just need to work on that.
We're so quick to diagnose things and just start putting people on drugs of
some sort without actually understanding what the causes of this are and
looking at how can we fix these things by changing the mental dynamic of
how we work.
And we've done that with all of our kids. Every one of our kids are very
successful because we never shielded them growing up.
You would not like being around my family because our family is brutal. Our
family culture is to pick on each other.
And we constantly are picking on each other, cutting each other down,
whatever it is, but that's how we do things.
But it created very tough kids. They go out in the world. If somebody says
something mean to them, it doesn't faze them at all.
They just keep moving forward, and that's what we wanted to generate for
our children.
Neither of us is advocating being mean to your kids, and I know the kind of
ribbing culture you're talking about.
Everybody knows that it's done in jest, and it's usually meant the opposite,
right? It's a way to show love.
Our kids are very well loved and very well taken care of, but we just wanted
to raise tough kids. We didn't want to raise soft ones.
Well, here's where I'm going, and I'll be transparent. I wasn't sure if I
should bring this up, and I'm still not sure, so I'm taking a big risk here.
I had this discussion with someone the other day, and it was very triggering
for them, which is the question. I'm not necessarily making a --
The fact you're having to stutter through this is the problem with society
today.
It is. But hey, you know what? The obstacle is the way. We're going to dive
into this. Here's the question. Is there such a thing as a healthy degree
of shame?
The reason why I mention that is shame has become anathema to a lot of our
society, and I'm not advocating that we just shame people to be bullies and
to be cruel to them.
But shame is a powerful motivator. It's really kind of our internal barometer
for when we realize we've achieved a state that we don't like being in.
It typically is what sort of prods the individual to take corrective
action. You're getting a little too soft around the middle, and you're like,
"You know what? I'm not feeling good about how I feel right now. I'm going
to start hitting the gym a little bit more or eating a little bit more
responsibly."
Or, "Gosh, I said this thing to that person. I'm feeling bad about what I
said. I need to change my behavior. I need to be a nicer person."
I believe shame is one of the emotions in the human toolbox, and it's really
what tells us where the line is of who we want to be and who we don't want
to be.
But as a culture, we have treated it as just like the Fed doesn't want to have
down business cycles anymore, and it's trying to have it be eternal summer.
I feel like as a culture, we've said, "No, no, no. We always have to eternally
not feel shame and only feel validated and supported."
I think there are times where that really serves against us as individuals
and certainly serves against society and certainly, to a large extent,
serves against our children when we let them persist in a state that is not
good for them.
This is all about trying to be more open about, again, not bullying, not being
mean, but just saying, "Hey, you seem to be in a place that's not good for you.
How can I help you get out of it?"
That's the way society should be. There's a saying that's very true. "Hard
times create hard men. Soft times create soft men."
In today's society, you say, "Soft times make soft people." It's all
support. It's everybody.
That's my whole point, which is you shouldn't shame anybody. It's the
golden rule.
Treat others as you want them to treat you. You shouldn't go around just
shaming people just to be mean.
You should be willing to help people, though, by telling them the truth.
If they come to you and say, "You know what? I don't understand why I keep
getting myself into this situation."
Well, Adam, it's because you keep making really bad decisions. You've been
driving drunk, you've been taking drugs, whatever it is.
Let's stop those bad habits and start making better bad decisions, as we
talked about before, and start writing the direction that you're going.
The issue of today is that if you take a look at society, we have the lowest
rate of church attendance that we've had on record.
You've got more and more people that have turned away from any form of
religion whatsoever.
It doesn't matter whether or not you believe in religion or you believe in
God or whatever else,
but there is a very basic set of rules that run through every religion, whether
it's Christianity or Judaism or being Baptist or Catholic or Hindu, whatever.
Almost every religion in the world says, "Don't kill people. Don't steal
from people. Don't lie to people."
Pretty much you find these 10 basic rules through every religion, and it's
just a way to lead life.
It's a way to have a healthy population, a healthy society.
As you turn away from those rules, everything kind of goes into chaos.
Now we've got ourselves in this position to where we just don't want to say
anything to anybody because we might hurt their feelings or we might do this.
We've also put ourselves in a position where nobody has to accept
responsibility for their position or their actions.
"Oh, it's not my issue that I don't have any money. I'm about to get evicted
from my house and I have all these other problems."
That's society's problem. Society did this to me. The rich people did this
to me.
We have taken the responsibility off the individual of saying, "It's my
responsibility for why I'm here. How do I begin to fix it?"
If they're going to reach out and ask for help, in order to ask for help
and to receive help, you have to be able to take responsibility for your
own actions first.
You can't cure an alcoholic if he doesn't want to quit drinking.
You can send him to rehab and as soon as they get out, they're going to
start drinking again because they didn't want to quit.
But the person has to be able to be in that point in life and say, "I'm at
the point where I know I have made mistakes.
I know this is my responsibility and now I want help to improve and to
be better."
But we've taken that all away today because of social media and the environment
that we're in.
Nobody wants to accept responsibility for their own situation and they just
want to blame everybody else and that's no place to start a healing process.
Yeah, I totally agree. I think we overshield the individual from feeling that
accountability and you can call that feeling a sense of shame that they want
to change their behavior.
And then societally, we have really removed a lot of the value system.
And this is another discussion which we can maybe go deeper at some point
in time, but I'm going to mention it now and we'll wrap things up.
I don't think I've discussed this before, but I've wanted to have this
conversation with you about this crazy idea I've had of the secular church.
Have we talked about this at all?
No, we haven't.
I grew up in New England, so the first small towns that were ever created
in the country.
And at the center of all these historic villages is the town hall and in
the earliest cases, the town hall/church.
So it was the same building where the town would meet up to deal with
self-governance issues and then every Sunday they'd come there for church.
Or probably in the earlier days, they were there every day for church.
And anybody who goes to church is familiar with the general structure.
And by church, I really mean any kind of religious organization, synagogue,
mosque, whatever, where you go there and you are reminded by the guy at the
pulpit or altar or whatever,
of the values of the community.
And that's represented in parables that are told and the sermon of the day
and all that stuff.
And it's a way for us to basically remind ourselves of what we hold as
values collectively.
And then it usually turns into action at the end, like, "Okay, so-and-so
had a baby. Everybody sign up for the meal truck."
You're putting those values into action in your community.
So fast forward to today, religion plays a smaller role on average in
people's lives.
We have a lot more people who don't go to church, whatever, anymore.
But I think the need for that institution of reminding ourselves of our
values is still there.
And so what I just wonder is, wow, how come somebody hasn't created a secular
church where it's like, "All right, look, I'm not religious.
We're not going to go talk about the big man in the sky."
Maybe the sermon is more like a TED Talk where we're learning about something
interesting in science or whatever.
But it's a way to still drive home the values that this community shares.
Maybe we do some collective things like sing songs together. Maybe they're
not psalms.
Maybe they're Taylor Swift songs or songs that people are excited to sing.
But we still do the same thing at the end where we put up the food list for
the people that have had babies that week or whatever.
But it's just a place to gather once a week, be in communion with our
community, remind ourselves of values, and learn.
Well, yeah, okay, but that's the important thing. This is the thing about
religion that's so important.
And again, it's not whether -- I've often talked about the Bible.
If you actually look at the Bible, it's kind of like the Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy, right?
Which is there's parables, there's rules, there's values, there's things
that you do, things that you don't do.
And if you follow this, you have a better outcome, right?
It's always interesting to me when I run into people that are not religious,
and I'm very religious, so I'll just put that up front, right?
But when I run into people that are non-religious, they'll say, "Well,
I don't understand why you pray."
It's interesting that whether or not you believe that there's some ultimate
being up there that is your protector and the creator of all things,
whether or not you believe in that, there's a very interesting thing about
prayer, which is that when you pray, what are you doing?
You're saying, "Thank you for the things I have. I have this problem. Please
help me figure out a way."
And what it does is it starts to align your thought process to be open
for solutions.
Yeah. Sorry to interrupt, but it's not that different from journaling in a
gratitude journal as well, right?
It's a focus of the mind and what you're going to focus on. Yeah, exactly.
Right. And you're opening yourself up to finding answers.
And of course, for Christians like myself, we say, "Well, God stepped in
and helped me out of this really bad situation."
Whether or not you believe that's the case, I opened myself up through prayer
to accept an outcome that was suitable to get me out of a particular situation,
whether it was the help or whatever. And this is the thing about religion
is you turn away from that, right?
And there's a very interesting thing. If you don't believe in eternal life,
then what are you living for?
Right? So you have to start to put things into perspective saying, "OK, if
I don't believe in religion or whatever else, then what's the meaning of me
being here?
What's next for me?" And so one of the reasons that, you know, as Christians
and really in a lot of religions,
the reason that there is some form of eternal life, whether it's, you know,
again, it doesn't have to be Christian.
I mean, we have the Vikings believe in Valhalla, right? So every religion
believes that there is something after this,
because if you don't believe that there's something else after this, then
what's your purpose of being here?
And there's nothing to guide you towards how to get to that next phase,
right? So the Vikings, right?
If I died in battle with my sword in my hand, I got to go to Valhalla,
right? There was a reason to go to battle.
There was a reason to fight. There was a reason to die because I knew there
was something after that.
If there's nothing there, if there's no Valhalla, why the hell am I going
to go swing a sword at somebody, right?
And it's the same thing with Christians or anybody else, is that if I lead
a good, virtuous life, I help others.
I love my brother. I take care of those that need help. I live a life
of service.
Then I get to go to this other place will think about that for just a second.
Even if that if even if you don't believe that other place exists, that's OK.
But if I lead a life of service, if I leave a life, lead a life of helping
my brother, helping others.
And this is why, you know, at RealInvestmentAdvice.com and RA Advisors,
we do a tremendous amount of outreach for our community.
We do we provide tremendous resources for free to help others.
This is the way that we give back as a company. We share our knowledge openly
and honestly, trying to help everybody we can to achieve a better outcome
for themselves.
That's how we give back to our society. But if I if I lead a life of service
and gratitude and help and love and care for others and help those in need.
If everybody did that, what kind of world would we have today?
Would we have the type of world that we have now that is divisive and full
of hate or we have a society where brother was helping brother, regardless
of race or religion or creed?
Because, see, Christians don't care about that.
What they care about is helping others. And it doesn't matter who they are,
what their makeup is, where they live, where they came from.
It doesn't matter. A true Christian will help anybody.
And I'm lumping everybody when I say Christian, don't get off onto a bend
if you're Jewish, I'm lumping everybody into religion.
So, you know, if you're Viking and believe in Baha'u'llah, you're Christian
for the moment.
You know, my point is, is that as a religion, you know, and being religious,
it doesn't necessarily mean you have to believe in this afterlife.
But if you if you lead a good and virtuous life, you're going to have better
outcomes, not only for yourself, because others will want to help you.
But you also help society as a whole.
So that's entirely why I'm raising this. And look, I did not and do not intend
for this to be a discussion about the tenets of whether to be religious or
not be religious.
My point is, I totally agree with you, which is that the, you know, living
the shared values of society that we have evolved over time that we know work.
Oh, we're going to support each other. We're going to be anti-crime. We're
going to be about treating each other fairly and well, the golden rule,
all that type of stuff.
The more we can live in that, the better off we're all going to be.
And my point is simply, organized religion, while it reinforces those values,
it doesn't have a corner on them.
Meaning like, all the other people who are atheists are just not that into
organized religion, it still benefits all of them. And that was sort of my
question and almost kind of my hope.
Is there a role for a non religious, secular organization to borrow the
best of that model and offer an experience? Because I think in general,
whether you're religious or not,
most people probably would benefit and enjoy being in some sort of communion
with your community once a week where you're having a good time, you're
learning a little bit,
you're reinforcing all the value. We all still agree we're not going to let
it be Lord of the Flies. We're going to look out for each other. Okay, good.
And if you want to do it in a religion, great. Go to the mosque, the synagogue,
the church, whatever. But if you don't, there's this alternative out here.
And the more people who do all that, the better. Yeah, no, look, you need
a guidebook, you need a rulebook, whatever it is for the religion, right?
If you're all gonna get together and just hang out, that's cool. But you've
got to have a purpose, right?
You got to have tenants, you got to have the declared community. We're not
going to murder each other, we're not going to steal from each other, we're
not going to sleep with others,
everybody else's wife, those types of things. Exactly. Right. Well, look,
fascinating topic.
And you know what? There's some great tax benefits to running a church,
so whenever you want to start one, let me know.
Okay, great. All right, well, look, we probably energized some folks, totally
alienated some others, but thanks for exploring both those topics with me.
We'll dig more deeply into them in the future if folks want to, and folks,
let us know in the comments how much you liked or hated this part.
All right, we've gone long here, so I got to wrap up. Just quick housekeeping.
As a reminder, I've got some great interviews coming up this week starting
tomorrow, Stephanie Pomboy.
We then have Jam Carson, who's known as Jamquasant on X/Twitter.
Folks have been asking me to get him for a long time. Thank you for doing
that because I wasn't super familiar with his work.
I really loved meeting him in that interview. That's coming out on Tuesday.
We'll then have an interview with Lakshman Achuthan, the value cycles guy,
and then John Rubino is going to come back on the program again soon too.
Let's see what else. We've got just a reminder for the RIAA event that Lance
talked about at the beginning of this discussion. Lance, remind folks when
that's going to be.
It is Saturday, January the 27th. It's in Houston at Hotel Sinesta. It starts
at 8 a.m.
Actually, we're going to open the doors at 730, feed you breakfast. We're
going to have speeches, basically presentations by myself, Michael Leibowitz,
Adam Taggart, Greg Valier talking about the presidential election.
We'll have an open panel after that. It should be out of there by 1230,
1 o'clock, so if you want to fly in, come to the seminar.
It's actually a very easy trip from Intercontinental in Houston to the hotel
and back.
It's all major highways, so easy to get back and forth to the airport if
you want to come in.
We'd love to have you, but tickets are online now at
realinvestmentadvice.com. Just click the banner at the top of the page.
Okay, go to your website. Banner's right there at the top. I'll still have
the link down below too.
All right, and then just a reminder for folks, I'm still nailing down the
exact date for it, but Thoughtful Money is going to have its spring conference
in March.
I'm already beginning to build a stellar faculty for that. It's going to be
excellent. Just more details to come in terms of absolute date as well as how
you can register for it, and we'll definitely have our early bird pricing and
stuff like that to make sure that folks that move early get the best prices.
All right, well, folks, look, I know we went long today. Sometimes we have
us telling people they want it shorter. We have a lot more people telling
us they want it longer.
