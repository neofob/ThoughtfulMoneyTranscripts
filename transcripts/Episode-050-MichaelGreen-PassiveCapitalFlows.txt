Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. The officially reported
headline GDP, jobs, and inflation numbers look pretty rosy right now, but how much of that is due
to actual healthy sustainable economic activity versus extraordinary government intervention?
Deficit spending as a percentage of GDP is currently at heights not seen outside of major
war times and government jobs have surged. Total federal employment reached its highest level in
at least 20 years last year. Is the government putting its thumb on the scale here? And if so,
is that a good or bad thing? To discuss, we're fortunate to be joined by Michael Green, portfolio
manager and chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management. Mike, thanks so much for joining us
today. It's a pleasure to be here, Adam. Thank you for having me. Oh gosh, it's always wonderful to
have you on the program. Mike, I feel comfortable saying this. You are one of the most intellectually
sharp guys that I get the chance to talk to, so it's always a pleasure. I'm going to do my best
to just hang on to this conversation by my fingernails as I normally do when we talk.
Lots of questions for you. Lots of what I think are pretty important questions for you,
but before we dig into them specifically, I'd just like to ask the general question I like to
keep these interviews off with. What's your current assessment of the global economy and
financial markets? Well, I think the two are related but not in quite the same manner that
everybody thinks they are. So if I think about the global economy, I think the notable characteristic
is that we're dealing with many of the aspects of the post-pandemic environment. Governments have
taken on an incredible amount of debt and increased fiscal responsibility. It's particularly true in
the United States but also true around the world. We're seeing deficits higher than we would expect
or higher than they're supposed to be in Europe, Japan, China, certainly, et cetera. The markets,
I think, unfortunately, are a little disconnected from the underlying economic data because of
things I've been on your programs and talked about in the past. Things like passive investment
have changed markets from being what I would describe as a thoughtful discounting mechanism
for future economic activity and instead largely turn them into flow machines that are tied to the
employment of, in particular, Americans but increasingly others around the globe
who are contributing on a regular basis as long as they're employed to things like 401(k) or IRA
programs and typically buying passive strategies or market cap weighted. And I think, unfortunately,
that leads to distortions that in turn create feedback loops on the policy side that can be
very, very confusing. If we were to look at the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ, we would say, "My gosh,
the economy is among the best we've ever seen." If we were to look at unemployment levels,
we would say they're remarkably low. But if we dig into each of those and we look at the
underlying characteristic, there's very, very few stocks that have actually made new all-time
highs since the levels that we saw in 2021. So we're now almost three years in metrics like
the Russell 2000, for example, where the majority of stocks are actually down over the last three
years, as crazy as that sounds, while the equity markets are perceived as near all-time highs.
Similar dynamics, I think, unfortunately, play through in the employment markets where we've
seen the unemployment rate begin to rise for those that are being negatively affected by unskilled
immigration. We're seeing labor markets begin to loosen up at the lower end of the scale.
And then the other thing that we're really seeing, and I think ChatGPT and the AIs are providing some
cover for this type of stuff, but we're actually starting to see signs of oversupply in the
"skilled" area of the market, those with college degrees, etc. It doesn't seem like this is
possibly true when we look at aggregate unemployment near lows. But the unemployment
rate for those with college degrees, for example, has basically doubled over the last 20 years,
suggesting that we're kind of beginning to run into either oversupply in those categories,
or that the value of those degrees is beginning to deteriorate relative to what we've seen
historically. And so I'm overall quite cautious that the data sets, while they would suggest that
things are really positive in both financial markets and in labor markets, one, I think the
two are linked in a way that is not about discounting future economic outcomes. And two,
I think that there are some rumbling signs that areas of the economy that have powered growth,
in particular things like the services economy in financial services, technology, etc., that those
are beginning to encounter some headwinds. And I'm not entirely sure what we do next is the
summary of that long-winded diatribe. All right. So I take a number of things away from this.
One is that, yes, it sort of sounds like in general, you're saying government is putting its
thumb on the scale to a certain extent with the increase in debt and fiscal deficits and some of
the policies that have morphed based upon how things have changed here. You're taking note,
I'll say, of what you see as a potential loosening in the labor market right now. And that's really
interesting because that has long been looked at as a bulwark standing between the rosy numbers and
not the soft landing, but the hard landing. So I want to ask you in a bit where you think that's
likely headed and what would happen if that bulwark really indeed started to crack. I want to
ask two really important things you mentioned that I want to ask you sort of the same question on,
which is can these sustain? Can these continue? So first off, I asked this question just twice
this past week to both Lacy Hunt and Sven Henrik, and I want to ask it to you. So we're now in this
new world where the governments have gotten a lot more involved. They've been intervening a lot more
and deficit spending, as you said, is something that we're seeing rise to elevated levels,
not just in the US, but elsewhere. And it's kind of become business as usual in the US at least.
So the question is, if indeed that's really the case, are we going to be able to dial that back
down at some point? Or is the system now getting so acclimated to this excessive juicing from the
deficit side that even just politically that there's no room for somebody to stand up and say,
"Well, now it's the time where we get to start tightening our belt. We've been spending more
than we should. We get to dial it back down." Is the political appetite out there for that now,
or is that now politically untouchable? Well, I think we're clearly actually trying
to create that appetite. Unfortunately, it's harder to do than we would expect. So
when you talk about dynamics like the high levels of deficits that we're encountering,
part of that is by choice. Hiking interest rate policy has significantly contributed
to a pro-cyclical deficit that was not anticipated. We've moved. I know that people
look at current levels of interest rates. They're like, "They're so low relative to what I remember
when I started working." I think it's really important for people to recognize that we're
actually looking at real yields that are quite high in an environment in which there's an
incredible amount of debate around whether we can actually sustain those real yields.
Because the debt mountain is just so much higher than people remember back in the 80s when they
had the 12% mortgage. I wouldn't even say that it's the debt mountain as much as it is the
potential energy in the economy relative to the kinetic energy in the economy. Let me just explain
what that means. Yeah, explain that. Kinetic energy, I would argue, is a function of you
are currently in motion. When something is in motion, it requires something to intervene
to stop it. Newton, a body in motion remains in motion until an external force acts upon it.
In the case of an economy, we refer to that as what's the catalyst? What is going to cause
it to slow down? There's a variety of things that can cause that, one of which is obviously
a credit event, which cuts off spending. It means that people can no longer actually obtain
resources that allow them to continue to spend over and above their immediate outcome or immediate
potential. It also can be a function of increased debt service associated with the credit that
they've already taken on. That's what an increase in interest rates is. When I refinance my existing
debts, looking forward, the servicing of those debts at higher interest rates is going to consume
a larger fraction of my income, making it harder for me to continue to spend, setting up the
conditions that cause things to slow. I think that's what we're facing right now. We're looking
at a situation in which everything is fine until people need to refinance the debts or confront the
reality that they need to take on additional debt in order to maintain spending. I didn't write
about it on my sub-sec. I did write about it on Twitter. There's actually been this rise in what's
called "doom spending," which is basically millennials and, to a lesser extent, Gen Zs,
who are saying, "I can't afford to buy a house. I'll never be able to afford to buy a house.
Therefore, I should buy a really nice watch," or, "Therefore, I should buy a sports car," or,
"Therefore, I should go with my friends and have brunch in the city and pay more than I
thought I was going to because, gosh, we just only live once." That type of dynamic continues.
The fatalist YOLO.
The fatalist YOLO. That's exactly what it is. I think there's a big chunk of us seeing that. By
the way, if we go back and we look at prior periods where we've seen those types of activities,
the 1920s obviously jumps out as a good example of that type of fatalist YOLO having watched
their peers chopped up on the fields of France and Germany or watching them die associated with
the Spanish flu put in place for a lot of people, well, what's really the point? All sorts of
cultural phenomenons emerged around that similar to the dynamics that we're seeing today.
That doesn't mean, by the way, I just want to be very clear, that doesn't mean the Great Depression
comes next, but it does raise the risks of that occurring. If I go back and I look at 1979 and I
describe the status of the US economy for you, we were dealing with very high inflation, but that
inflation was being driven primarily by a large outward shift in the aggregate demand curve.
That was a function of the baby boomers being young and doing what young people typically do,
which is buy capital assets that get them started in life. That's renting an apartment in a city
that has a job available to them. It means buying a suit. It means buying a dishwasher. It means
buying a car so you can get to that job, et cetera. That outward shift in the aggregate
demand curve is really what powered most of the inflation of the 1970s. As that peaked and began
to come down, as labor force growth and household formation growth slowed in the 1980s, it became
easier for us to catch up on the supply side to the demand equation and normalize and bring down
inflation to levels that we're currently used to or that we were used to until the pandemic.
What happened this time around is something very, very different. We're actually looking at possibly
the lowest potential growth in US economic history. Population growth has slowed to a crawl.
Almost all household formation at this point is the elderly, those who are no longer economically
active. The supply of labor has actually been quite restricted. The labor force growth levels
are a tiny fraction of what they were in 1979. They were three plus percent in 1979. Today,
they're running about 10 basis points. By the way, for many segments of the economy,
like those with less than a high school, less than a college graduate degree, we're actually
seeing contraction in the labor force, which helps to explain the tightness that we've experienced in
those segments of the labor force. We're looking at something that's almost 180 degrees in the
opposite direction of where we were in 1979, where under the deregulation framework and the cutting
taxes framework, we were able to liberate an incredible amount of growth in the US economy
with very little increase in labor content. That's why the 1980s and 1990s looked so fantastic.
Now, of course, we're trapped in the situation. As bad as it is here in the United States,
put yourself in China's shoes. 1972, Nixon travels over to China. Basically, everybody in China is
wandering around saying, "What do we do now that we've finished killing off our elders under the
Cultural Revolution?" They didn't have any steel. They didn't have any manufacturing operations.
They didn't have anything other than a ton of people that were underutilized. Now, China has
gone to the other extreme where their labor force is actually shrinking at a more rapid rate than
almost any we've seen in history. Initially, that shows up as a demographic dividend. "Great,
there's no kids. I don't have to spend any money on them. I can spend money on productive things
because kids are not particularly productive," followed by, "Oh my gosh, who's going to take
care of me in my old age?" Unfortunately, that's kind of the status of the world today.
Who's going to take care of us in our old age? The deterioration of the deficit, as we were
mentioning, has two components to it. One was the unexpected rise in interest rates. The second one
is the entirely predictable aspect that in the United States, we have a pay-as-you-go retirement
system in the form of Social Security, Medicare, etc., and those are exploding as those same baby
boomers leave the system and begin drawing those down. There's no way around that other than to
abrogate our responsibility to them, which candidly, I would argue they should be
volunteering for. This is one of the real frustrations that we have. Those that have
been most successful in our society have become so disenfranchised and so focused on the idea that
they created what they have and that they are the ones that are rightfully entitled to their success,
not those who are members of the society with them that have been less fortunate
or candidly less skilled or less thoughtful in the application of the resources that were made
available to them. We're turning around and saying, "Well, I'm not going to help them."
The answer is, unfortunately, we have to at some point, and so if the elites, those who have done so
well, are not willing to make those choices, the reason you're seeing the rise of the trumps and
the rise of populism, etc., is because the will of the people is ultimately going to force them to
take it and then some. Well, so I generally kind of tread into this territory usually later on
in these discussions because it's hard not to see most of the roads that we're on
eventually ending up in this area unless there's just major reform, which I don't see anywhere.
I hope for and I think that we're still early enough in this process that there's a chance
for it, but the longer we put it off, the longer we wait until those who have the resources stand
up and say, "Hey, look. Here's what we can do to fix it and here's how I'm going to do more than my
fair share to start the process of fixing it." The closer you get to that end point, the higher the
risk that you put in place an authoritarian who forces those changes through and takes a pretty
penny for themselves in the process. Or you run the risk of really big breakages
that redistribute wealth either by just destruction. You have sort of a systemic
breakdown that just wipes out a lot of asset value or you have an uprising where it's just
taken in a really messy way. I want to actually address that though because I think it's really
important that people understand this. When systems break, understand it's not the billionaire who
suffers. Everything should be measured as distance from subsistence or survival. What we're
seeing in our society with rising homelessness, with rising deaths of despair, etc., are more and
more people who are basically close to that quitting point. They're right on the edge.
Are their lives meaningfully better than the lives of chimpanzees, great apes,
our primate ancestors living in subsistence conditions? They're really not. Look at the
homelessness in major cities and look at the levels of drug addiction. These people are
far more desperate and far sadder as individuals than we ever would have been historically. It's
just an incredible display of helplessness. All right, so I've got a ton of questions
related to macro and the economy that we're still going to get to, but I want to dig into here
first because this really is I think the heart of our destiny as a society.
So Mike, let me ask you this. The question I'll often ask people is, "All right, so I make you
world emperor. What reforms would you put in place?" Hopefully, you were a benevolent one.
And so I guess I want to ask you that question, but let me ask you sort of a lead into that,
which is, do you see the best of the reforms that you would like to see undertaken
happen from a top-down standpoint like the government mandating, "Okay, we're going to do X,
Y, or Z," or do you see it more on the private side where there's a lot of stuff that government
now is in control of that basically sort of private charity used to run in previous generations?
And some would say quite well. So I guess my question is, do you favor more of a state-driven
solution or of a private-driven solution? Well, let me just ask you very quickly. When
you say that charities have historically done quite well, could you give me an example of what
you're referring to? Yeah, a lot of hospitals certainly were originally back in turn of the
century. You had a lot of hospitals that were funded by private individuals.
People will oftentimes contrast that to government policies we have right now in healthcare that have,
some would say, really ballooned up costs and brought care down and are
demoralizing our doctors and our nurses and whatnot.
Yeah, so I do think that there's an element of what both of us are saying there. So when I think
about the institutions or the dynamics of charity, we've moved from charitable contributions to found
hospitals or to create sanatoriums because health tended to be the great equalizer in historical
periods. So the children of the wealthy were not particularly well protected from tuberculosis or
communicable diseases relative to the children of the poor. You had a lower chance of getting typhus,
but you were still drinking from the same water supply. Today you'll see situations,
and this is kind of extreme, but I know of situations where people will only drink
particular types of bottled water at the extreme level of it. That's been shipped in from various
places around the world, so they can maximize their water intake. Stop, that's not that water,
Adam. And there doesn't seem to be any sense of responsibility or what used to be referred to as
the noblesse oblige to give back in that way. And I think part of it is because they're so insulated
from those characteristics. I also think there's a big chunk of it, which is just a candid that
we've torn down a lot of the institutions that historically would have encouraged people to
participate in the community in that way. So common attendance at church, something that
the very wealthy used to do as a matter of course at the end of the 19th century during the Gilded
Age, was an opportunity for people to be part of the broader community that they participated in.
Today, people are more likely to lay in their wonderful horsehair bed that's been cooled by
sleep pods to exactly the right temperature to maximize their sleep, and they pull out their
smartphone and they tweet something snide in terms of an observation about how terrible the world is.
That's a very different way to spend your Sunday than putting on your Sunday best and going to join
in communion with your compatriots in your society. So I just think people are much more separated,
and I think the elites are much more separated. They just give much more, at least until very
recently, to the organizations that characterize them as elite. Let's give it to Harvard. Let's
give it to Penn. Let's give it to Stanford. Why? What a stupid way to give money away.
Yeah, so back to my question then, which is...
So to answer your question directly, I think part of the problem is that, again,
I don't necessarily see the elites making those choices that they would have historically,
and I think part of that could be that the government is trying to take on
those additional responsibilities. But please, find me examples of brand new hospitals being
created or brand new social infrastructure that is being created to any significant degree,
because it's just not really happening. We're basically operating on this PAYGO type model
where everything is focused on, "Well, let me just give you a check to tide you over to today."
Right, right. Oh, I totally agree with that. So again, and we're about to make you Emperor Mike,
but do you think that the reforms that we need, are they going to need to come from the state,
or are they going to need to come more from the citizenry saying, "Hey, look,
I've had a great ride up until now, but if I don't start contributing back, if I don't start getting
more involved, if I don't start laying the infrastructure we're going to need to kind of
bring everybody up more, the pitchforks might come out and my elitism might actually put a big target
on me." The quick answer is, I don't think that there are a lot of examples in history where the
pitchforks have come out and targeted the elites without a segment of the elites turning on the
other elites. Peter Turchin, I encourage people to actually read his work. It's in an area that's
called Clio Dynamics, but his underlying hypothesis is effectively that when there is a surplus of the
elites, too many college grads, too many people have bought into the narrative that if they pay
$85,000 a year to go to Harvard, or $35,000 a year to go to Harvard Extension School, that that
somehow makes them a member who has guaranteed success in society. Not unlike joining the Masonic
Lodge in the 18th or 19th century would convey that you were part of an elite that received
preferential treatment. That's really what they've become. That's what universities have become.
So, you know, there's just not a lot of examples in history of the elites stepping forward and
saying, "Okay, what can we do to make this better?" It does require the sort of catastrophe or social
event like in the 1930s that empowered Franklin Delano Roosevelt to become a traitor to his class
and effectively say, "We're going to make people pay far more for their participation in this
society and the opportunity to make this sort of income." And by the way, I just want to convey,
I don't think it's right to set 94% tax rates, right? I just want to be really clear that was
a vindictive action by Franklin Delano Roosevelt that when people show you the highest marginal
tax rates over history, I just want to remind people, six people in the entire United States
paid that tax rate. Henry Ford was the target. Thomas Watson was another one. So, you know,
it's not like that was actually a sign that everybody had to give up 94%. But there are
periods where it makes sense to say, "No, we all need to pull together and taxes are part of that."
And there are periods in which it's like, "Hey, wait a second. As 1979 showed, we've got
incredible potential growth ahead of us. We've allowed the government to become too intrusive.
We've allowed regulations to become too severe. And as a result, we can actually make progress
in the opposite direction." I just think these things go in cycles, right? They're like sinusoidal
waves. We're almost certainly at a point in which there will be higher taxes, there will be more
government involvement, there will be additional regulation coming our way. And I know that's a
very frustrating message. But the more we can actually embrace that, and our leadership can
actually take a leading role in conveying why this is important, and why it's powerful, and it has to
come from people that people identify with. I have a really hard time believing that they're identifying
with a geriatric in either party. So someone who would agree with you would be Neil Howe,
a demographer created the fourth turning. Fourth turnings are characterized by a rise in centralized
control. In fact, it's not just the government stepping up to do it, because there are problems
that need solving. It's actually the citizenry demanding that the government get involved more
to solve these problems. So it is what we tend to see in these cycles here. I asked Neil, and you
probably find this interesting, I asked him, when I look back on previous eras, where we had real
challenges in this country, we can point to leaders and say, "Oh, these people were really
critical in creating a platform, and rallying support around it, and driving real reform."
And I said, "I'm looking around here. I'm not seeing many right now. Do we just have a
bum crop this time around or whatever?" And he said, "No, we'll have them.
They don't volunteer for the role. They get thrust into it, and the pressures just have to get great
enough for that new leader to get catapulted higher." And he said, "We just haven't had the
pressures get that great enough yet." But let's say the pressures get that great, and one of the
leaders that emerges is Emperor Mike. I know this isn't probably the conversation you thought
you were going to have when you hopped on with me today, but which one -- I actually planned on
coming here as the kickoff to my campaign to become Emperor Mike. Okay, well, you got my vote,
even though it's Emperor, maybe you don't need it, you can just take it. But which one or two reforms
that you would start with right away? So the quick one is that I would raise
taxes in a significantly progressive way. I would undo the Trump tax cuts. I would reverse much of
the tax cuts that have been done since 1986. The simple reality is that we have a problem of tax
collection, not necessarily of expenditure. It's not so much that the federal spending
is a percentage of GDP, particularly that that's spent on infrastructure, on education,
on science and technology, on military. It's not that those have expanded so much.
It's actually that we're spending a lot more in the form of social support, and we're collecting
a lot less in terms of taxes from those who have benefited the most from our society.
The second thing, and unfortunately I probably flipped them in reverse,
which is to say the second component is that I would try to encourage people to think about
treating the US budget as a capital account. What are we investing in? And there's almost
no scenario in which you can argue that investments in the old have any value except
to convey that we care and that you are going to remain a member of our society past the point
that you are entirely productive. But right now what we have is we basically have people voting,
"Let's not spend money on kids. Let's not provide adequate nutrition. Let's actually take it out on
people who can't afford to take care of themselves and basically make conditions for them so
unattractive that they're willing to work for me for pennies on the dollar." This is a terrible
policy, and that I would argue is where we need to reorient. So I would refocus the budget. I
actually did this. I'd refocus the budget around education and spending. I would encourage the
creation of private-public partnerships, things like charter schools for example,
and I would go a step further and then actually encourage, create the conditions under which
we can take successful models of charter schools and we can rapidly expand them.
We just don't have that today. I think you were aware I'm a regular donor to a charter school in
Coney Island, New York called Coney Island Prep. It has unbelievable success with amongst the most
challenged populations, immigrants and those of reduced economic circumstances in Brighton Beach,
New York. They're producing kids that are going from kindergarten through high school
and attending college with something like a 97% success rate. Why that's not being replicated,
I can't figure it out. I just don't understand it. I do mechanically because we have a society
that is set up to do things like protect the jobs of teachers over encourage the outcomes of students,
but man, it's there. We just refuse to act on it. I use this line all the time. We lacked the courage
to change. The last policy that I would do is I would go bananas, and I mean bananas,
on building on nuclear capacity. You and I have talked, I think offline, and I do have a note
here if there's time to pull some of the things that you're really optimistic about from an
economic standpoint. I remember the last time we talked after we turned the camera off, we talked
for a bit about some energy technologies, innovations that you were excited about.
Nuclear, I think we've talked about enough on this channel that I think it's a growing awareness that
that is, I think, going to have to happen at some point. You talk about we lack the courage to
change. I totally agree with you. That's part of human nature, I think, in general. We generally
don't act until the pain of continuing the status quo becomes greater than the pain of change.
I really wish that we would not wait until that point about most things in life, that we would
proactively, like you, think about what the consequences are going to be in the future and
change today to avoid them. But hopefully, on all the things you mentioned, maybe saner, smarter
thinking prevails before we get to that pain point, that must change pain point. But who
knows? You probably won't. I am actually more hopeful than you are on that. I mean, to me,
the changes, and I'll pull up a chart. I know that this is done on YouTube, so we can highlight it.
I'll pull up the chart. I'm looking for it right now. It actually highlights one of the key
challenges, which is it's very hard to explain to people the counterfactuals. It's really, really
hard to explain to people how much better their life could have been if X choice would have been
made because they just can't do it. I think that's part of the education process that needs to occur
is actually convincing people that there is a better future ahead for us if we choose to make
those choices. Yeah, and what I don't understand on that, and I know you're looking for the chart,
is we're a big country. I mean, we got a lot of land. We got a ton of people. Why couldn't we
be doing more of pilot programs like you talk about your charter school there? Why can't we
just say, "Look, let's pilot a couple of different educational models, and then let's see how they
perform, and then let's adopt what the best ones, the best results are revealing to us." Why don't
we do that with nuclear? Why don't we put some SMRs in one county and just say, "Hey, that wants
them," and say, "Hey, let's see how it goes, and if it goes great, fantastic. Let's roll those out
and deploy them nationally." We have the ability to do all this, and that would go a long way to
convincing people, but we don't seem to be that planful about it. I think part of it,
again, is that fear. If you're going to build nuclear, for example, you actually need to
acknowledge that you'll have to engage in eminent domain, and nobody wants to do that.
As painful as that sounds, and I know people hear this, "Eminent domain? You've got to be crazy,"
but you need to actually do that. Look, this is U.S. energy consumption per capita,
and you may have seen me show this chart, but I just want to nail this home for people.
What happened here was the abandonment of the U.S. nuclear programs and the implementation of
the Clean Air Act. We basically told people that what we were doing was unsustainable,
that we were destroying the world, and we needed to do less. We needed to have less. We needed to
put on our sweaters, as Jimmy Carter might point out, and turn down the temperature.
The decision to do that meant that we took potential capability away from people. It meant
that jobs that could have been here in the United States had to be outsourced to China,
or to Mexico, or to Europe, or Japan at that time was much more likely.
That difference, that gap between energy consumption per capita in terms of power
output per person and where we are today, what could have ultimately happened, is the equivalent
of every single person in our country getting to go to the moon and back twice on a vacation trip.
Now, that sounds like a terrible vacation, but it just gives you some idea of the quantity of
capability that we're talking about, and we know that people actually want this because the other
uses of it, things like flying private jets all the time, is what the really wealthy in our society
does. So we know that the demand is there, and it's an unmet demand, and it manifests itself in
frustration. That's a fantastic chart. That really makes the point in a way I haven't seen made
before. So I've done other interviews in 2023 about the promise and the benefits of nuclear
energy. So we're not going to hash all that out here because if you're questioning it, if you've
just heard for most of your life that nuclear energy is bad, and it comes with all these risks,
it's a much more nuanced story than that, and actually a lot of the prevailing
wisdom about it, or at least what we've been told over the past 50 years since that
point of departure on your chart there, Michael. A lot of it's not really based in a lot of proven
fact and evidence at this point, and the opportunity is so tremendous, as Mike's been
saying here. So anyways, folks, go listen to some of my past interviews on that if you've
got some questions, but I guess let me ask you this, Mike, and then we'll get back to the economic
side of things. On the nuclear side, if we did invest in the capacity that you think we should
be creating for the society, what are some of the biggest manifestations that you would
expect to see coming from that in terms of benefits? Well, I mean, obviously we get to
travel to the moon and back twice, but no, I mean, everything that we're talking about,
when you talk about making the right choices, right? So thoughtful choices about how to spend
your resources, it manifests itself in less work, more leisure, better outcomes. That sounds like a
trifecta win for me, right? We get more output, we get less work, and we get more leisure.
I don't know how anyone complains about that, right? And it sounds really ridiculous to
actually focus on that, but these are the things that we're talking about. If we improve the
education of our children, if we improve the productivity of education, just stop and think
about this. Most of your audience will be parents or grandparents, right? By definition, those are
the people that have money. How hard is it to get your child to pay attention to a smartphone?
It's harder to get them away from the smartphone. And yet those same tools that we use to create
this addictive piece of hardware equipment that conveys unbelievable information is totally absent
and those techniques are not used at all in education, right? And these are all the little
simple things, like when you're scrolling through Facebook, they know when you pause on something,
they know when you stop and consider something, they know how much time you spend looking at a
certain segment of the screen. Ask a teacher how much time each student spent looking at the
calculus textbook. They have no idea. They have absolutely no idea. We're not providing teachers
with the modern tools that actually would allow them to demand and create better outcomes for
their students. On the flip side of that, we're doing the most ridiculous things. We're leaving
unmonitored cell phones in the hands of teenagers when they go off to high school.
We know that this destroys outcomes. We know these are bad choices.
Why would you ever do something like that? I mean, just give the kids heroin for heck's sake.
Yeah, I just hear you talk here. I'm reminded of Charlie Munger's show me the incentive.
I'll show you the outcome. We have in many cases more mal-incentives than we have positive
incentives and therefore we're not getting the outcomes we want to get. But we know that. We've
always known that. That's why we have things like sin taxes, right? Why do we tax things that are
bad for us? It's not because we want people to do less of them per se, although we know that that's
actually a positive outcome, right? But we also know that they really have a hard time not doing
them. And so by taxing them, we're actually generating revenues associated with that and
theoretically redirecting. The objective of putting taxes on gambling or special taxes on marijuana
or special taxes on alcohol is not about paying pensions for public employees, right? That's not
a great outcome. It is about funding schools. It is about funding innovation. It is about making
our infrastructure better and more robust. And we're just not using it for that because we don't
actually have the systems in place that allow either transparency or even really thoughtful
analysis around these things. All right. And thoughtful analysis. So I really appreciate
you having this discussion with me, Mike, here. We're at the point where we have
some very big looming problems in this wealth inequality that just continues to get wider and
wider is a huge one. And clearly, near and dear to your heart is the mind, Mike. And it's at the
point where there's a lot of things we could be doing better to help that we're not, right? And
we need to find the will to start doing things right and putting positive incentives in place
and positive systems in place. But we're also likely so far ahead of this problem that
we're not going to magically solve it without some pain at this point in time. And Emperor Mike,
a lot of the things you proposed, not so much the nuclear stuff, but some of the other stuff,
be really painful to those that currently have a lot of prosperity in their lives.
And we can have a huge conversation about the justice or injustice of that.
But my point is there's no easy solutions out here. And obviously, ignoring it,
not talking about it, is the whole not having a plan is to plan to fail, right?
We just need to start having these adult sized conversations about this. And I'm sure some folks
have heard some proposals from you on this that they don't like. And that's okay. We just need to
start having a conversation of, hey, anybody have a better idea? Because if not, there's a destiny
down here that's not going to be good for anybody if we let the current trajectory keep on going.
Yeah, no, I think that's right. And I think we all know this, right? I mean, there's always
the definition of a choice means for going an alternate, right? Right. We all would love to
have available to us every possible choice with no possible restrictions. We hear this all the time,
you know, from people who are effectively, you know, anarchists in their underlying construction.
We'll hear things from the crypto community. I'm going to piss any number of viewers off. But,
you know, things like, well, there should be no rules against money laundering. What a terrible
idea, right? You know, who are you to say what is a criminal activity or not? Well, guess what? You
participate in a society, right? Society actually defines criminality. That's what a law actually is.
And the fact that you don't want to follow those laws is not your prerogative. We have a solution
for that. It's called jail, right? That unfortunately is part of the responsibility that we
each have. We may not actually agree with all the decisions. I know I personally would be horribly
upset and angry if the government came along and said, guess what? We've looked at all the places
that we could possibly build nuclear in this area. And your house is the perfect siting for it,
right? I don't want to sell my house, but somebody is going to have to. And at some point we need to
recognize that things that are in the constitutions, like the takings clause, doesn't prevent the
government from acquiring your property. It prevents the government from taking your property
without compensating you, right? There's a big difference between those two. Let's argue about
the compensation. Let's stop arguing about should the government be allowed to do that or not,
right? We have to make these choices. All right. Well, look, Mike, I hope you
will continue to come on this program and help advance the ball on this discussion,
which I hope to be having with more and more people too as we go forward from here. Because, again,
the stakes are just too high for us to not try to figure out a better way to step into the future
than the current trajectory that it seems to be we're on on many fronts. But that being said,
let me pull the conversation back. It's been great. Okay, I've got one big risk, and then I
want to sort of end with your market outlook. And as a capital manager, you're having to figure out
how to navigate this world. So I'm curious what you're looking at for 2024. So I'll short
circus this by saying I just watched an interview that you gave with Ted Oakley. And Ted asked you,
"Hey, Mike, so what's up with the recession?" And you basically said, "Hey, there are a lot
of factors that intervened last year to kind of maybe suppress the visible impacts of a recession.
We might have kind of had recessions going on in certain parts of the economy, but we didn't get
that big rollover we all thought about." And if I heard you correctly, I think you said your
attention right now is maybe a little more focused on the credit side of things and the fact that we
may have a credit or we could have a credit event coming up. It sounded like you were pretty focused
on what's happening with the maturity wall that's coming up corporate America. And based on your
comments, I also am going to extrapolate to just US households as well, which have been taking on
debt at a much higher rate recently, where they may be beginning to hit their debt saturation
limits at some point too. So how concerned are you on the credit side of things? So I'm pretty
concerned. And again, I'll show a couple of slides here just very quickly since we do have the benefit
of multimedia here. So first, this is the maturity wall that we're facing in high yield. Those who
went through the housing market crisis may remember that there was a similar discussion
around the maturity wall, around teaser rates and all sorts of stuff that effectively create
conditions under when you need to refinance. We've currently gotten to the shortest time to
maturity in the history of the high yield space. The average tenor of a high yield bond is now
under five years in the index. If I go back to 2007, that was eight years, for example. So
that maturity wall that used to be much flatter has now become much steeper and much bigger.
The second component is the level of change that we will encounter when companies refinance.
If I look at the current coupon across most levered companies, it's about four and a half
to five and a half percent is the coupon rate that they are paying on their debt. When interest rates
rise, that debt falls in the secondary market. What's called the yield to maturity or the yield
to worst rises to reflect the current level of interest rates. But it has no impact on the actual
cash outlay of the company until they refinance. So now we're actually rapidly approaching this
point and the spread between the levels of the coupons that they're currently paying the cash
outlays and what they will likely have to pay is probably the widest it's ever been in history.
And that's before we start considering the underlying dynamics of what happens if a credit
event exists and forces a repricing of credit to much wider spreads. So you have this underlying
characteristic. These debts have to be refinanced at much higher rates or paid off and simply these
companies can't pay them off. And that then leads us to the second part of it, which is the credit
spread dynamic. This is my credit model in black. You can actually see my estimate of credit spreads
in red. You can see the absolute level of those. And interestingly enough in blue, the light blue
line, this is actually realized bankruptcy is the reason why I'm showing that as you can see how
that the contours of that pretty closely follow my black line even though that black line does not
include bankruptcies as an input. So my black line, theoretically, my estimate of where credit should
be is independent of the level of bankruptcies but is being confirmed by the level of bankruptcies.
Just for folks watching this and for those that are listening on a podcast and can't see this,
your red line and your black line here, your red line is where credit spreads are right now.
Your black line is where your model says they should be. And if I've got that right,
then here in these last couple of years, massive divergence between the two.
Massive divergence, larger than any divergence we've seen,
including the precursor to the global financial crisis.
So if your model is right, this means that credit spreads really need to start blowing out.
Yeah. I mean, my models would suggest credit spread should be closer to
800 basis points as compared to the current levels that are in the low to mid fours.
Okay. I don't know if you have any more charts to show if you do pull them up, but if not,
I want to ask you this question. We talked about employment as being sort of the recession bull
work earlier. If this maturity wall starts hitting in earnest, as your data says it should,
could that be what breaks the employment bulwark where companies have to start jettisoning
staff to retain costs? To be able to pay the rent, to pay the interest on their bonds.
I definitely think that's a critical component of it. And if I look at the levels of employment,
while AI may sound exciting and sexy, there's a tiny fraction of the US population that has any
direct employment in those areas of growth. Meanwhile, the levered companies, those that
we're highlighting here represent about 30% of US employment in total. And so we're actually looking
at a potentially quite significant event from the employment standpoint. Now where this of course
becomes really perverse is if you think about the underlying dynamics of tight credit spreads,
what's perceived as loose financial conditions, markets at all time highs, unemployment low,
if you're an employer, you're going to do everything you possibly can to avoid making
these hard choices, not just on refinancing your credit, but also in terms of retaining
your employees. In a tight employment market, the last thing you want to do is be the person
who fires people because it then becomes very hard for people to go back to work for you.
They find other jobs, they become permanently employed elsewhere, and you suddenly are trapped
in a very difficult situation if your forecast happened to be off. And so you'll hoard labor as
much as you possibly can until the last possible second. And we're seeing a lot of evidence of
this. Falling hours rather than unemployment rising is a perfect indicator of exactly this
type of dynamic. I can't possibly know that this is going to happen. But what I'm suggesting is that
the cycle seems to be setting up so that it's a much higher probability than it is under normal
consideration. And when you say it's a much higher probability, are you talking about
the switch from hoarding to jettisoning? Yeah, so I mean, look, if the government were to come out
and say we will pay all employers to keep people employed, then we won't see the rise in
unemployment, right? That's pretty straightforward. Right. And sorry, just to interject, because that's
really relevant, we've just seen the ending of the ERP, the employment retention program. So
the government's basically saying I'm done. Yeah, and not only are you seeing that, you're also
seeing the levels, so the signals that we use to send us this information, things like unemployment
rates, initial jobless claims, etc. The level of jobless benefits has fallen so far relative to
incomes, particularly in the aftermath of the increase in wages that we saw around the pandemic,
that we're actually seeing very strong evidence that people are just saying, well,
you know, what's the point? Why would I bother to file for unemployment claims? Right. State
of California, you max out your employment benefits at around $11,000 a year. That's
something like 75% below the poverty line in California is $11,000 something. And by the way,
that's taxable. Congratulations. You know, should I flip around and chase after that $11,000 and
have to show up and demonstrate that I'm continually looking for new work? Or should I
start driving a car for Uber, drawing down the depreciation on an asset I already own and probably
owe money on and make a little bit more money, but at the same time, understand that I'm in an
industry that is even more susceptible to an economic downturn, and worse outcomes,
and that hitting all at once at the same time, right? It's that fragility that I'm seeing us
build, where the information systems that we would have historically relied on things like rises and
jobless claims aren't happening because they're just meetings. Right. And I've been making this
analogy of, you know, central planners basically being pilots in a plane where the instrumentation
is increasingly off. Right. 100%. And by the way, like you heard Jerome Powell extolled the virtues
of the quality of data coming from the labor segment of the economy on 60 Minutes last night.
I mean, I was literally sitting there like, I can't believe you just said that because we know
that the quality of the data we're getting out of the labor, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is
the worst we've ever seen. We actually like that's not me making a statement. We know response rates
have plummeted. We actually know that the information that we're receiving is increasingly
massaged by things like the birth death model, which presumes the number of jobs that are being
created. And by the way, in last week's revisions, which people will point to as contributing to the
labor beat, the only data that was actually revised by real data, not by seasonal adjustments,
was Q1 of 2023, for which we reduced employment estimates by 370,000. Right. So all those positive
revisions that show, oh, December was actually better than we thought and January was downright
magnificent. All that data is like basically massaged. And the actual real data said, yeah,
the start of Q1, the start of 2023 was much worse than we thought it was, even for all the negative
revisions. I got to start wrapping up. There's so many questions that we didn't get to that we're
just going to-- Well, let me steal from you for a second and give you one that I think is actually
the really important one. And so I'm just going to share one more slide for you because this is
really why I think a lot of this matters in a pretty meaningful way. People that have listened
to me in the past have heard me talk about the bid for passive and the structural dynamics of money
flowing into 401(k)s. And I just want to emphasize and highlight for people that we're actually now
starting to see what I was worried about, which is the signs that the market is hitting a point at
which the flows into these strategies are beginning to slow and turn negative. And I'm going to use
two different slides here to show this just so people are aware. 401(k)s, which are the savings
vehicle, those almost exclusively flow through mutual funds. We're actually seeing signs that
those are beginning to turn negative in the mutual fund side. All right. And why?
Simply because the aging of the baby boomers, they're moving out of the retirement system.
They're beginning to draw down the system. It's just a numbers game. And the last thing I would
just highlight on that is remember that withdrawals are always a function of wealth in a 401(k). It's
how much is it worth? Contributions are always a function of income. So when assets rise faster
than incomes, withdrawals will cross over this point faster than they otherwise would.
Right. So that's part of what's ultimately playing out here. So this is a demographic feature. This
is the same deterioration that you're seeing in the US financial budget, fiscal budget. If you
exclude the interest rate increase and that mutual fund downturn has been offset up until this point
by ETF growth, which is money that's reinvested. It's unusual to see those in things like 401(k)s.
If I combine those two on a dollar for dollar basis, we're actually seeing that slow
and turn negative for really the first time since the start of the pandemic.
And this appears to be much more structural in its feature. This is what I'm scared about. This
is what I'm worried about is when those passive vehicles that operate off of those super simple
models, if you give me cash, then buy. If you ask for cash, then sell. We're starting to see the
signs that they're being asked for cash. All right. This is huge. So you have talked about
this. I referred to it, I believe, in the past as the giant mindless robot. And this has been,
you think, a large, perhaps massive contributor to how financial asset prices, stocks, most
importantly, have just been grinding higher, particularly a certain part of the stock market,
like the mag seven, the stocks that get an unfair share of every new dollar contributed to the
market. And as long as those capital inflows continue to be net positive, then the math
basically says, well, then stocks have to go up. And your fear has been if those capital inflows
begin to turn negative, you have that same phenomenon just in reverse. And if this begins
to happen for a structural reason, then we basically are in danger of a big unwind of a lot
of the stock market prosperity that we've seen, say, over the past decade. True? Unfortunately,
that's correct interpretation of my fears. Okay. Okay. So, man, I feel like we're ending
right on the real meat of the entree here. I guess I got to ask, so I got two questions for you.
One is, how worried are you about this? Is this, I'm a little bit worried, or is this like, hey,
we're getting close to DEFCON one. Let's start with that one.
Well, the quick answer is that the quality of data and the timeliness of data that we
get prevents me from ever going to DEFCON one. I just want to be really clear.
The second is that authorities can play all sorts of games and they have done that. So,
I was actually quite concerned about this in the fourth quarter of 2018. If I were to pull
that same chart back up, you would have seen a similar pattern of slowing and you actually
would have anticipated that you were going to see this number turn negative in 2019.
We changed the rules. We actually increased benefits associated with participating in 401ks
and extended the duration date by removing what's called the required minimum distribution
from many accounts. We changed it from 70.5 years of age to 72. That bought us additional time.
It raises the magnitude of the problem now that we face, but it bought us time.
They can pull a rabbit out of the hat. There are things that can be done. The US government could
decide we're going to give $10,000 to each person to save in the stock market. I guarantee you that
you're going to hear proposals like that floated over the next couple of years with the objective
being to make everything better. The lobbying coming from Vanguard, BlackRock, et al. is very
much in that direction. Whether we see that or not, I can't possibly know, but we are running out
of games that we can play. All right. That's where I was going to go, which is can they just do this
forever, but it sounds like you think that eventually the magic hat runs out of tricks.
I think that's right, although it is a magic hat. I can't really tell you how magic hats function.
I wish I had one, but I don't. Look, I think there is no alternative for saving for retirement. I
think there is no alternative for these things, but the perverse aspects are that if my theories
are right, what's actually happened is that we've undersaved, that we have taught ourselves to
consume at a level of consumption without saving and without investment in the resources for
actually making real assets. I see this all the time on Twitter and interactions where people are
like, "Well, it's just so much more work for me to go get real assets. That's why I want financial
assets. I don't want to own apartments. I want to own REITs because then I don't have to
go collect rents." Well, guess what? If you're not actually doing the work, I think that the expression
from Web 2.0, if you're not paying for it, you are the product. Well, guess what? That applies
to 401(k)s too. If you're not putting your blood, sweat, and tears into figuring out what's going to
happen with your retirement dollars, then guess what? You're actually the product. That's a great
way to say it. All right. Well, look, so you're a capital manager. You have to navigate and chart
your client's capital through all this. As you look out into 2024, we're still at the beginning
of the year here. What kind of market are you expecting this year? And of course, it's got the
additional uncertainty of an election year. And right now, what assets look favorable to you for
this environment? And maybe which ones are you less likely to want to touch? Yeah, I mean,
going into the fourth quarter of last year, I was very much in favor that people should be buying
bonds. Once we crested 5% on the 10-year, to me, that felt like an absolute no-brainer.
And in particular, I was actually highlighting for people things like 30-year tips that were offering
two and a half plus percent real yields for the next 30 years. That, to me, felt like one of the
biggest no-brainers in history. Today, it's a little bit more challenging. Those 30-year tips
in the aftermath of Powell's interview on 60 Minutes have moved back above 2%. So,
I actually think those are kind of interesting. I would argue that the delayed nature of the
information that is flowing to Powell is contributing to this perception that they
aren't going to be cutting anytime soon. I was fortunate to hedge my portfolio against that by
buying what's called puts on the SOFR futures. Those are now paying off, and I'm taking them off
and flipping that back again into longer-dated interest rates, which I think are actually
reasonably attractive given the underlying dynamics of slow population growth, et cetera.
On the equity market side, it's a very bifurcated outcome. If I'm correct about the direction that
things are going to head, what's holding the mega caps up right now is not actually so much
flows, although they are still more positive than they are in the other segments of the economy,
as much as it is things like buybacks, et cetera, and general sentiment around it.
But if those turn in any meaningful way, or if the flows become large enough to swamp those—and
again, remember, these are big numbers we're talking about. Apple's buying back $80 billion
worth of its stock this year. But if those start to turn in any meaningful way, then you'll see
kind of what you saw in 2022. 2022 was driven in my analysis by the Fed hiking interest rates,
not because it made it difficult for businesses to operate in higher interest rates,
but because the Fed hiking interest rates from zero, very, very low interest rates,
to higher levels of interest rates is akin to a deus ex machina, the god from the machine in a
theater production coming down and solving the problem. I'm going to hike interest rates. That's
going to cause things to happen. It's deus ex machina, something outside of the system that
comes in. And so when they do that and you hike interest rates, it causes bonds to fall.
And perversely, if you have a portfolio like a target date fund that has a fixed allocation
between bonds and equities and bond prices fall, what do you have to do? You have to sell equities,
buy bonds. Bond prices go down because of hike and interest rates, sell equities, buy bonds.
And we actually saw this pattern play out almost perfectly in 2022. This suggests that there was
almost no fundamental information. That's what's called the portfolio rebalance channel coming
through. That dynamic, I think, is actually the key risk that we face where the portfolio
rebalance now becomes one of the portfolio exit. And so you're going to get all sorts of weird
information coming from markets because just imagine the scenario, right? I head to retirement,
I start to take my money out. What am I doing? Well, I'm actually further selling down equities
and probably not buying that many bonds. And so you could end up with a situation which
equities are going down and interest rates are going up because supply is increased while demand
is not necessarily growing in the same manner. Now, I think ultimately that will break. I think
that the opportunities to buy fixed income and secure a certain outcome for many of the
institutional players that have things like asset liability matching, et cetera, I think that's just
becoming a little too, the clarity around them is becoming pretty overwhelming. I think that's part
of what happened in the fourth quarter is what I call sticky allocations. If I'm running an
allocation mechanism that says I need to be in equities and all of a sudden the information that
is available says to me that the opportunity set to make money in fixed income, which is inherently
lower risk, has risen so much more relative to equities that I have to start taking that
and taking my assets and reallocating them. That's not a decision that is made lightly.
It requires constant reinforcement. It requires people sitting down in meetings. It requires all
sorts of amazing discussions about how the future might be different from the past. And only once
those have happened, can you start changing those allocations? I think we saw some of that in the
fourth quarter and now it becomes just a question of, do we see that continue? But in the simplest
terms, I think the future belongs to fixed income. I think we know that if we thoughtfully evaluate
what we're seeing in financial markets, where I would argue that many of your listeners are
probably doing things like covered call strategies or income generating strategies out of their
equities because they know what they need is certainty. They need income. They need some
dynamic that says, here's how much money you're going to make, not just how much you have.
Because they're terrified understandably about outlasting their assets. They're trying to turn
those into fixed income securities to pay yield to them. That tells me the demand for fixed income is
off the charts. When you take equities and you engage in a covered call strategy, all you've
done is create a high yield bond with no covenants whatsoever. That's what the payoff function of
that is under what's called put call parity or risk neutral arbitrage. So when you actually
think about what people are doing, they're trying to create fixed income securities because
there's a shortage of them. And so I just think the future belongs to fixed income.
All right. Future belongs to fixed income. Hey, one thing you didn't mention that I
thought you were going to say is betting on some increase in credit spreads.
Well, so I absolutely do have that. So in the funds that I manage, I have the ability to buy
CDS, credit default swaps. I also create synthetic exposures to that through equity long short
overlays. And so we have a couple of products that simplify that have the capacity to do that,
in particular, our high yield credit with a credit hedge is a way of capturing really attractive
returns and at the same time protecting your portfolio against an increase in credit spreads.
Last year was a very nice example of how that product works well. Outperforming the benchmark
and that was a very positive experience for us. So those types of strategies are absolutely there,
but I really do strongly encourage people to just stop and think, what are you actually doing with
your portfolio when you buy a structured product or you buy a yield product? You're synthetically
creating bonds. And so the question is, are the bonds attractive enough that you should be buying
them outright? And in some areas, I think the answer is yes. All right. I've had some requests
of late to do an interview on income generating assets. I'm not the least bit surprised. Yeah.
Yeah. And it sounds like you think that's probably only going to continue. The need for that's going
to continue desire. So folks, if you are truly interested in that, chime in the comment section
below. If the demand's high enough, I'll bump it up on the priority list. All right, Mike,
thanks so much for going a little bit over with us here. I'm just going to land the plane here.
Two questions for you, two last questions. The first is very importantly, for folks that have
really enjoyed this conversation and would like to follow you in your work, where should they go?
Well, for that one person that's left that I haven't offended and is left that has really
enjoyed this conversation, you can find me on Twitter @profclumb99. You can find my sub stack
at Yes, I give a fig.com. It's also in my Twitter bio. And then for all of the products that simplify
and the type of work that we do, as well as all the information around those, please check out
our website at www.simplify.us. All right, great. And Mike, when I edit this, I will put up the URLs
to all those on the screen so folks know exactly where to go. Folks, I'll have links to those as
well down in the description. So if you want to one click access to them, you can get it. All right,
real quick before I ask you the very last question, Mike, which is going to be what is a non money
related investment you'd encourage folks to consider adopting? Just a couple quick housekeeping
rules. One, if you've enjoyed this conversation with Mike, would like him to come back on with us
again in the future, particularly to finish some of the conversations we didn't get a chance to get
to. But also if his models start blinking, very worrisomely on some of the issues we talked about,
please let them know that by hitting the like button, then clicking on the red subscribe button
below as well as that little bell bell icon right next to it. Just want to remind folks that the
tickets for the conference on Saturday, March 16 are available for sale. They're actually selling
pretty briskly, which is wonderful to see. A lot of folks are taking me up on my recommendation to
register now if you want to go so you can lock in our lowest early bird discount price before it
expires. A reminder that if you're a premium subscriber to my substack, which only costs $15
a month, you will save $50 on top of that early bird discount price. So take advantage of that
arbitrage folks. Sign up just for a month if you need be to spend the $15 to save the larger $50.
I'm happy if you do that. I want you to get the lowest price. FYI, Rick Rule just signed on to
that conference. So another great name being added to all the other ones that are already there.
And then just a reminder, I think Mike's done a good job here of explaining why this is a
challenging environment for the average investor to navigate, especially if you're a regular person
with a regular job and a family and all sorts of other things that are demanding your attention.
So as usual, highly recommend that you work with a good professional financial advisor who's in
good standing with the regulatory authorities, but one that takes into account all the macro issues
that Mike and I talked about here. And when you add that last variable in the universe actually
gets pretty darn small. If you've got a good advisor who fits that requirement set and is
doing a good job for you, great, stick with them. They are definitely worth it. But if you don't,
or if you'd like a second opinion from one who does, feel free to schedule a free consultation
with one of the financial advisors that Thoughtful Money endorses. These are the guys you see in the
channel with me every week, the guys from New Harbor, Lance and the team from RIA, Jonathan
Wellum from Canada. To schedule one of those free consultations, just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com.
They're totally free. There's no commitment to work with these guys, just a free public service
that they offer. Mike, now we're back at you. What's one non-money related investment you
think would pay dividends for folks to consider? Well, you actually indirectly alluded to it. So
I think some people are aware, but last year I became an empty nester and I actually sold my
house, moved from California. My wife and I have been traveling around trying to figure out what
the next step in our lives looks like. And the most impactful thing that I've realized, and this
should not be a surprise to those of you who have listened to me in the past, is just how much I
value being in proximity to my children and ultimately my grandchildren, and how much I've
seen that impacts the happiness of those that I've gone to visit. So if you happen to live near your
children or your grandchildren, I would argue that you are on a one to 10 scale of happiness,
you're automatically adding three points to it. So if there's one thing that I would encourage
people to do, it's invest in the relationship that you have with your children and with your
grandchildren, and figure out the ways to spend as much time and invest in them in the ways that
our society is currently not. That's such a great way to say it. I talk a lot in this program about
if you go to YouTube and search for interviews with people who live to be 100, they all say the
same three things in terms of what matters in life, and quality of relationships, particularly
those with family are always number one, Mike. So you hit the bullseye on that one. And I'll tell
you, having a similar perspective, and really tried to ask myself, what kind of parent do I
want to be in my children's lives? I've seen through my life journey that when parents can
intervene, not enable, but they can intervene and provide just a little bit of an extra push at just
key moments in life, like maybe helping your kids afford getting into their first house, or whatnot,
you can oftentimes set them ahead a decade or two with not a lot of investment or not a lot of
contribution, but just being positioned to be able to just give them a little uplift at these
key moments in life, you can serve as a massive kind of happiness and life return catalyst
for your kids. And again, it's not in a way that enables them or makes them spoiled. But
that's really what I've tried to aspire to become as a parent is trying to identify where in their
lives I can really help them out. And in many cases, too, it doesn't necessarily even require
that much of an outlay. But over time, it's like a lever point where you're really changing their
future trajectory a lot by playing that key role right at that point in time. You're nodding a
little bit as I'm saying this, but your point about investing in them in a way that society
isn't, there are sometimes these key moments where a little bit of investment just goes an
awfully long way. I think that's really true. I also would caution people for exactly that reason,
right? If you can't afford to do that, be honest, right? And don't encourage your children to go
absolutely crazy trying to keep up with the Joneses, whether that's in education or anything
else. The simple reality is I was very fortunate that my parents made tremendous sacrifices despite
coming from very modest means to give me the best education that money could buy in an environment
in which they couldn't possibly do that. It really hurt my family's outcomes had it not been for the
fact that I was fortunate and successful in that framework. But one of the things I see all the
time is people stretching to do that. And I would just encourage people to remember there is no
golden path. There is no certain outcome. You don't need to be part of the elite competition
in the same way. The simple reality is if your kid wants to be a plumber, encourage them to be
a plumber. Don't encourage them to be a philosophy major because you think that a college degree is
the answer, right? It's not. The answer is to be close to your children, to give them your life
guidance, and to position them to be successful in every way possible. Adam gave one example with
just the little lovers you can provide them with. Make sure you're not putting millstones around
their neck with expectations as well. I've seen many parents guilty of what you've just said,
Mike, which is they want to help their kids so much that they're sort of stealing from their
own retirement and then they end up basically becoming a burden on their kids and everybody
ends up losing. So you want to make sure you avoid that. And on the other end, too, is to use
my example of helping your kids get into a house, help them get into a house that makes sense for
them that they can afford. What you don't want to do is help your kids stretch themselves
ridiculously to get into some house that today is record unaffordable prices. You've put in what you
can and now your kids are chained to this mortgage that they really can't afford going forward and,
god forbid, housing prices ever correct. Then it becomes, to your point, a real millstone around
their neck. So you got to do this conscientiously and wisely, but if you do it right, everybody wins.
Yes. We're in complete agreement on that.
All right. Well, look, Mike, fantastic discussion. Thank you so much for coming on. It's always a
total joy to talk with you. Again, as I said, anytime that your dashboard is telling you
something that you think is important that you want to get out in the world, you got an open
invitation to come back here on the program anytime. Really enjoyed it, brother. Thanks
so much. Everybody else, thanks so much for watching. Thank you for helping me out.
Thank you.
