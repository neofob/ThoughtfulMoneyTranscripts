Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its
after a surprisingly strong year in 2023
for both the economy and stock markets, 2024
is off to a roaring start. The S&P and
NASDAQ are back to all-time highs and
the recently released Q4 GDP data beat
analysts expectations positively by a
long shot.
So are we in the clear? Is the soft
landing camp being proven right?
Have we been able to sidestep the lag
effect that so many expected from the
quantitative tightening? Is inflation
indeed on its way to being tamed this
year? For answers, we have the great
world's largest global banks. He now
and chief economist of Hoisington
thanks so much for joining us today.
Well, Lacy, it's always a pleasure
questions for you. I know you've got some
I'm sure strong opinions about the
questions I just asked there in the intro,
but before we get to them, just to set the
stage here, let me just ask you a very
high level question, which is, what's your
current assessment of the global economy
and financial markets?
Most of the major economies
of the world
that are
of significant importance
are in recession.
That would certainly be the case of
Europe, the UK,
of Japan. The Chinese situation is
clouded by the unreliability of their
data, but clearly the Chinese economy is
extremely challenged. The United States
economy has
continued to grow,
but not all of the indicators are
consistent with each other.
The major divergences between
the two different measures of employment,
one is showing a good gain over the last
four months, the other is showing a
decline.
In economics, one of the
critical concepts is that in aggregate
what we spend must equal what we earn. In
other words, that
gross domestic product equals gross
domestic income.
Over the last three quarters or four
quarters of data, which is only through
the third quarter,
you have a record dispersion between
GDI and GDP. GDP
is up by 2.9 percent, but real GDI
is actually down by two-tenths of one
percent.
A major divergence.
And so
there are very positive aspects.
Some of the most popular indicators do
indicate strength,
but when you look deep under the hood
you find a lot of problems
domestically, although I think it is
fair to say that the United States
is doing better than any of its major
competitors at the present time.
Okay, well let me just get straight to
the question then.
Yeah, it's a little bit of a mixed
bag in the US, but like you said,
there's some real positive
indicators there, even though there's
some other indicators that say maybe
things aren't quite as rosy,
but big picture, are we in the clear?
Did we dodge the bullet? Have we made it
out of all the distortions of the COVID
rescue
era with all the stimulus and
all the rate hikes and the quantitative
tightening,
and did we manage to get through all
that without
falling into recession or is there
one or several shoes to drop still at
this point in time?
I don't think that we're out of the woods
by any means. I think there are
significant challenges and will continue
to be challenges.
There's also the lesson of history.
High inflations lead to recessions
and
that process could play out for a
long period of time.
One of the things that's very
unique about
2023 is that we had
the sharpest deceleration in inflation
for any year in which the GDP was rising,
and in fact, the fall in inflation last
year was
greater than in 60% of the
recessions
since the late 1950s.
Another critical difference is that
last year we had
a tremendous increase in debt, huge
increase in debt.
People talk about the resiliency of the
consumer
and how well the consumer did,
particularly over the Christmas selling
season and in the fourth quarter.
However, this was a debt finance quarter
in the month of December.
Your real personal consumption expenditures
were up five-tenths of one percent, but
your real disposable income
was only up one-tenth of one percent.
In other words, 80% of the gain was
financed by
taking on more debt. A lot of it was
financed by credit cards and
in an amount yet to be determined, there
was also the introduction
of these "buy now, pay later" programs,
which were an inducement to encourage
consumers to spend.
You wonder
why, if things are so resilient,
the consumer has to be given all of
these inducements.
There is a problem,
an even greater problem, with the "buy now,
pay later" programs.
If one does not meet the payment
schedules
under "buy now, pay later,"
the interest with the fees jumped to
something like 25%.
That's an astounding
interest rate,
especially at a time when the inflation
rate is now rising less than three
percent.
In addition to that, the
25% that you pay when you default on
your
"buy now, pay later" programs is even
significantly greater than the average
credit card interest rate, which
in November moved to a new all-time peak
of over 21.5%.
If someone has any understanding
of compound interest in the rule of '72,
they know that in a very
short order, paying interest rates of that
level,
you're going to pay twice as much as you
originally borrowed. Those are very high
rates,
and especially for households
in which the rate of increase in
in wages is only running about three and
a half percent annual rate over the last
six months.
So the consumer did spend, but the
consumer made themselves in an even more
vulnerable
area, and that is that they have further
undermined
the stability of their balance sheet.
The personal saving rate
in the month of December was a paltry
3.6%. Historically,
the personal saving rate is averaged
close to 9%,
and in fact, we're at the lowest
personal saving rate of the last decade.
There's just one reading
during the pandemic, the height of the
pandemic, when personal saving was
less
than it was in December, and
prior to the pandemic, the
personal saving rate was 6.8%.
So yes, the consumer has continued to
spend, but they've been spending
well beyond their means,
and paying very high interest rates
that are
made even higher when we take into
account the fact that the inflation rate
and inflationary expectations
are coming down.
All right, so is it almost fair to
say that the economy
is sort of still experiencing a
stimulus here,
this time not necessarily being funded
by
the monetary authorities or even the
fiscal authorities, even though I know
there's a lot of fiscal spending going
on, and maybe we'll talk about that in a
little bit,
but it seems like the consumer is now
subsidizing
GDP by bringing down its savings rates
to
historic, near historic lows,
and being willing to finance the
difference to keep their lifestyles
going at this increasingly expensive,
revolving debt
that's out there, and if so, and if
that's true,
that's got to have some sort of
expiration date on it. I mean, consumers
can't do that forever. They hit
basically debt saturation where they
either can't afford to take on any more
or they get cut off by their lenders,
right?
Well,
the definition of debt,
which was given to us by Bob Baywerk, the
famous Austrian economist a long time
ago,
is that debt is an increase in
current spending in exchange for decline
in future spending.
Now, Fisher modified Bob Baywerk, and he
said
unless the debt that you're taking on
generates an income stream to repay the
principal and interest,
but if you're buying Christmas gifts or
fancier foods for the table over the
Christmas selling season,
that's not the kind of thing that's going
to generate an income stream
to repay the principal and interest, and
so
the consumers have become more
vulnerable, and
if you give the consumers
credit for understanding what they're
doing,
then the fact that they were willing
to go so heavily into debt
in the fourth quarter is an indication
of the high pressure that consumers are
under.
We and
all of us are very interested in flows
rather than stock. We want to look at the
change in the latest time period
rather than the absolute level, and one of
the consequences
of the inflation of the pandemic,
which is not going to go away and is
going to be with us for years to come,
is that during the pandemic, a lot
of the things that are critical
to a high standard of living, for example,
the cost of buying a family home, the
cost of buying the family automobile,
went to very astronomic levels.
What's happening now is the rate of
increase is coming down
slightly, but the price of homes
and cars remain extremely elevated,
and neither one of them
are very affordable. There are various
statistics on automobile availability and
the affordability of
automobiles, affordability of homes.
Some of the home measures indicate that
the affordability is at all-time low.
There was a recent
study by Cox Automotive, which
indicated that
61 percent of our households are
basically priced out
of the automobile market, so the
prices
of things which are essential for
an enjoyable lifestyle are not really
attainable,
and so it's going to be a long
workout process
before the American household is going
to be in a position
to enjoy the things that they were able
to enjoy
significantly on easier terms prior to
the pandemic. The pandemic has left huge
scars on us,
and those are remain.
I'll illustrate that in one other way.
If you look at the real median family
income,
and unfortunately the data is only
available
through 2022, but we've had three
consecutive yearly declines
in real median income, and we're back to
where we were in 2018,
and another measure that you can look at
is the real weekly earnings
of all of our full-time hourly
and
weekly workers or monthly workers. That's
120 million people,
and in the 12 quarters of this
expansion,
from the end of the pandemic to where
the latest numbers are,
there's been a two and a half percent
rate of decline. That's 120 million people,
and so one of the worst
consequences of the pandemic
and the high inflation is that it
has left the economy
with an exacerbated income and wealth
divide.
You can say that the aggregate figures
look okay,
but the vast majority of people were
terribly harmed by the inflation.
Inflation
robs almost everyone, but it robs the
modest and moderate income households
the most,
and those effects are out there, and
they're not going to go away anytime
soon,
and to think that somehow that we
were unscathed
by the inflationary response to the
pandemic,
in my opinion, is a wrong-headed view.
Okay, Lacey, so you have put your
finger on something I've been railing
about a lot of late on this channel. I
think you are an exceptionally good
person to have this discussion with,
which is really the plight of
what I'm going to call the bottom 80%.
I feel like I'm even being generous. I
think I could ratchet that up to the
bottom 90%, and it would still be
accurate.
So I want to dig into kind of what
the implications are of this. You're
basically saying the consumer
has been damaged, scarred by what's
going on here. Those obviously are
going to have long-lasting implications.
I've got two key questions for you on
the impacts, the second of which
we're going to push off a little bit in
this discussion because I want to get
an understanding of what's going on
to the corporate and the government
level as well before we really get into
the big implications here. But first off,
we're what a two-thirds
economy that is driven by consumer
spending. So you talked about how
we've had this explosion in
consumer debt and that debt by those
definitions is future spending pulled
into today. So do you expect
there to be a spending drought coming up
here at some point in time because we
pulled so much future consumption in?
Unless there is some way to turn this
debt into an
accelerated income stream
but the debt went for current
consumption. It did not go for investment.
Right, it's non-productive debt. It was
just in the moment.
And I believe that you can use the
production function to understand this.
The aggregate production function says
that economic output is determined by
technology
interacting with capital, labor and
natural resources. If you overuse
one of those factors of production such
as debt capital,
initially the GDP will rise. If you
continue to use that that one factor
debt capital,
the GDP levels out and you still overuse
that factor you
you hit diminishing returns. There's a
concept given to us by the
the great
British economist David Ricardo and so
we triggered
the law of diminishing
returns. But now
we have an even more grave situation
because in in 2023
on an aggregate basis
the federal budget deficit exceeded
all of the private saving and the
foreign saving that was contributed to
our economy.
And now the private saving has a
household component and a corporate
component.
That's only happened seven times before
2023.
All of those were serious economic
contractions.
Four were in the great depression from
1931 to 1934
and then the other three occurred during
and immediately after the great
financial crisis.
So when you have negative net national
saving basically what it means
is that the economy is financing
consumption
by not replacing the value of the
capital stock that was
depreciated by various uses.
And that's
a very
has a very deleterious effect that will
accumulate over time
and that's where the United States is
today.
One of the critical concepts in
economics
is the circular flow that
that investment, net investment, net of
depreciation
must equal aggregate saving net of
depreciation.
And so when we have negative net
national saving
basically we have not replaced
with our current investment
all that was needed to cover the decline
and the
depreciation that occurred during the
year. It's a case of eating the
seed core
and so before the overuse of debt was
triggering the law of diminishing
returns
and that's a great situation. But now we
have an even more critical situation
because all of the economic
and budget deficit absorbed
all of the private and foreign savings
and that basically
means that the standard of living will
continue to decelerate
as we go forward in time. I don't know
any way for the standard of living to
rise
unless we're able to increase the
capital stock and to have a capital
stock increase
you must have net private saving, net
positive saving.
Okay, so that does sound pretty
grim from an outlook in the sense that
when you eat your seed
corn, when you burn your furniture
in the winter to stay warm,
you're getting an immediate
benefit
for a substantially worse
future
problem. Those problems eventually have
your day reckoning where
that can can't be kicked anymore. It
sounds like you're worried about that
can approaching and history
seems to show every time we've done this
we've had a contraction in the economy.
So we've been talking a lot about the
consumer here. I want to talk about
corporate
America and then the government because
what we haven't mentioned
yet is if corporate America starts
having issues
it may then indeed having to start
laying off workers and that just makes
the consumer situation
all that much worse. It just brings in
that day reckoning even sooner, I
would imagine.
Is that true and how is corporate
America doing right now? It's absolutely true.
Now, we don't know corporate profits
for the fourth quarter
and consequently we do not know gross
domestic income. So we know
we've been given the
preliminary first estimate of GDP
but we do not have an estimate of GDI.
If you look at the four quarters ending
the third
the last time when we have both GDI and
GDP
both real household income and real
corporate income declined slightly.
In other words, the corporate sector
using the national income and product
accounts was in reverse last year.
I know this is not a
a widely held proposition but I
personally believe
that the federal data is better.
The federal government is relying upon
the income tax data.
If you overstate your earnings for the
income tax you're a fool because then
you'll pay more taxes.
If you understate your
income tax to the IRS you're also a fool
because then you could be
thrown in the jail for
trying to cheat on your taxes.
So there are great issues as to
how viable the corporate sector really
is at the present time.
Now there is no question in my mind
that we have a select number of very
high profile corporations that are doing
extremely well.
There's no question about that.
They're the cutting edge of technology.
We all know their names,
but it's not clear
that at the present time that the great
success of this limited number of
corporations is being enjoyed to any
wide-ranging extent outside of that group.
And just on that point,
we have a lot of people on this channel,
Lacey, that talk about the lack of
breadth that the market had in 2023.
It wasn't really until the very end of
the year.
I think by November,
the beginning of November,
all of the gains in the S&P were in
those magnificent seven stocks and the
equal weighted S&P versus the market
weighted S&P was still negative for the
year. It was only at the very end of the
year that it caught up. We're seeing a
similar dynamic here at the start of
2024 where most of the market's gains so
far this year have been in those top
seven.
When you look at where the jobs are,
they're in small to mid-sized companies.
So if you're basically saying
the fruits of the economic growth we're
seeing right now are largely being
enjoyed by a very small number of
companies and the rest aren't
participating,
that gets scary from a job standpoint,
correct?
Yes, it does and here again is
one of the issues that we're all
grappling with.
When I discuss these data problems,
I don't want you to think that
I'm saying that there's anything
nefarious here or that there is some
sort of
a conspiracy, but we have very serious
problems
with the payroll survey,
which the market gives its greatest
function.
Now, the payroll survey
has a survey component of large firms
and then it has an imputed
model to pick up the growth of your
small firms
and over the last six months of the year,
all of the growth was in
the imputed sector.
Well, at the same time,
the response rate to the federal
government of the survey that sent out
to the large firms
keeps going down.
Well, any statistician will tell you that
as surveys become less and less
robust,
they become less and less reliable and if
you have
a survey that has a survey component
that's becoming less reliable
and an imputed component which is
dominant,
that there is reason to
believe
that the data may not be an
appropriate indication of the true
condition of things.
Now, the household survey does not suffer
from that.
It's just a large random sample of all
individuals out there
and it's indicating that since
September, we've had a decline of 400,000
jobs.
Now, if you say, "Well, I've
got to live,
I've got to take the payroll survey. I
want to take it at face value."
That's what the traders do. When they see
the number, they're going to react.
But looking at the payroll
survey for face value, there are two
things happening.
Number one, the employment is going up.
We're all well aware of that,
but these large firms are saying at the
same time
that they're reducing the average work
week.
They're hiring workers, but they're making
everyone work shorter hours.
In fact, the average work week
was as high as 35 hours. It's now down to
34.3 hours.
Since September,
the gain in payroll employment
in job equivalents has been completely
negated by a decline
in the work week. The
index of aggregate hours
in the payroll survey is basically
unchanged,
and so
the fact of the matter is the
labor market data is far more mixed
than is generally believed,
and frankly, it's almost impossible
to know
which of these conflicting factors is the
most reliable.
Good point. It certainly makes it
challenging, too, for the central planning
authorities.
If some of their indicators are not
giving them potentially
super accurate information, then how can
they make
accurate or how can they make good
choices? Very unfortunate situation.
So, Lacy, the last time that I saw you in
person, I came out and visited you in
Austin, which was wonderful, by the way.
Definitely one of my highlights over
the past couple years,
and they were building
several new really large skyscrapers
that were being built for and paid for
by a few of those magnificent seven
stocks that we just mentioned.
What's the status of those right now?
I remember at the time thinking, "My god,
things are just exploding here in
Austin. How are they going to fill
these buildings?"
And then, of course, Austin fell into kind
of a real estate freeze there,
but I believe I've heard that
either construction might have stopped
on some of those or they're just
they're sitting empty.
That's wrong. I don't know. What do you
see there? Some of them have been
malformed.
I have to be quite honest
with you. I live in Austin, Texas,
but I don't really look at the regional
trends.
I occasionally pick up something on
hearsay
or this, that, and the other, but I do look
at the national office vacancy figures
and Moody's has a series that goes back
into the early 1980s and the office
vacancy rate right now is at an all-time
high.
We're not just overbuilt in Austin, Texas,
but the office market is overbuilt
on a nationwide basis.
I think there's a considerable excess
supply there.
It's going to take time to work it off.
Right, and we're seeing a bloodbath in
commercial real estate right now as a
result and, of course, work from home
did actually change some things probably
in a permanent way to a certain extent,
even though there's a back to the office
movement growing now.
My point was simply to say
that these big engines of growth,
even they themselves, are sort of
ratcheting back some of their
hiring plans that they had had
even just a year or so ago. In fact,
a number of the layoffs that have been
announced in January this year
have been from a lot of those big names.
They're not immune to this.
Information here that I can share with you,
we follow the work done at Piper Sandler,
Nancy Lazar and her outstanding team,
and they keep track of these layoffs.
They've jumped rather
considerably in the last month,
month and a half.
Now, the layoffs don't necessarily
translate into reduced head count
immediately because when you're a
large firm, you have to issue a warn
notice. You have to give your workers
a 60-day notice.
Also, in most of these situations,
I would say nearly all of them,
they give severance.
From the time of an announcement,
it may be three, four, five months
or possibly even longer before
the layoffs actually translate
into lower job opportunities, but
the Piper Sandler folks do an
outstanding job of counting these
layoffs and they clearly have
risen substantially and we've seen them
according to Piper Sandler from very
prestigious names.
All right, so back to my earlier
point of if we get into
enough of a contraction where we start
seeing layoffs akin to
the way we've seen in previous down
terms where we're getting hundreds of
thousands of jobs lost
per month, that could be a real
game changer on the worsening side
of everything you have just talked about
today with all the consumer spending
challenges, correct?
And it also suggests that firms,
regardless of the fact that they want to
hold their price levels,
in this environment where income is so
far under the rate of increase in
spending that they're going to have to
find ways to induce the consumer to buy.
And how do you induce the consumer to
buy? Well, we use the trick of buy now
pay later,
but they're going to have to be price
reduction and so
in the current situation it could
simultaneously
lead to a less vibrant labor market very
quickly,
but it will also serve to put
further downward pressure on the
inflation rate.
That's a question I can't
believe we haven't even had yet, which is
where do you see inflation going? I'm
going to presume
you probably think it is
not going to be a big issue going
forward because I know in the long run
you've had a very deflationary
bent in terms of what you're really
worried about in the long run.
Before we get to there, a couple
quick questions but one observation.
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to make this somewhat
linear but it's so challenging because
there's so many great things I want to
get sidetracked with you on.
But I think,
so I agree with you, I was just at a
conference this weekend and I basically
said, "Look,
there's so many factors going on,
but I think that the escape release
valve, like the pressure release valve
to all this is eventually going to be
price," and I was making that comment
mostly in terms of the housing market but
I think you just made it in terms of the
general economy and it sounds like
humans being humans, Americans being
Americans. We'll try every bad idea
before, at least corporate America will
try every bad idea it can before it
actually has to bring prices down. You
talked about buy now pay later. I want to
just mention one thing I just learned of
the other day. It's called earned wage
access and it's these companies
that basically say, "Hey, if you want to
get what's coming to you in your
paycheck but a little early,
we'll lend it to you," and it's
sort of a new fancy dressed up version
of payday loans and here's the catch,
and I'm quoting from the article here,
"In some cases, high fees and frequent
use can translate to an annual interest
rate of more than 330%."
So it just shows you there's just
these terrible, terrible
solutions that we're going to toss out
there. I'm afraid a lot of people didn't
look at the terms of the buy now pay
later schemes. There are substantial
penalties on them and the rate goes very
high if you don't pay on time.
I think honestly, Lacey, that is probably
one of the most predictable headlines of
later 2024 is all of a sudden we see
massive defaults on buy now pay later
and who could have possibly seen this
coming? I think sadly it's those
folks like you who are just looking at
this and saying this is a disaster
waiting to happen. You're basically
pushing a toxic non-solution on the
people who can least afford to get
victimized by it.
Can I answer my outlook on
inflation now? Please do.
To me, I like to stick with the basics
and the basics are inflation and the
final analysis is too much money tasting
too few goods.
Well, what do we have today? Production
has been restored.
There is tremendous excess capacity in
Europe, Japan,
China. The amount of excess capacity in
China is impossible to know.
Okay, sorry to interrupt. I just want to
underscore the point you're making here,
I believe, which is this is the inverse
of what we saw in 2020 that created the
cost push side of the inflation that we
dealt with, right? You had
a massive inward shift in the aggregate
supply curve.
Now the aggregate supply curve is
shifting outward. The major focus, of
course, of China is to try to export
their way out of their very dire
domestic conditions and by the way, their
inflation rate is falling
because their economy is so weak, which
means that
that will be translated into lower
selling prices in the United States.
But in the United States, not only do we
have an increasing availability of goods,
we have increasingly too many
goods,
but the Federal Reserve has served to
create an unprecedented or virtually
unprecedented monetary contraction.
As you know, I like to look at other
deposit liabilities as being a superior
measure of money.
We have a record decline for the last
12 months, the last 24 months.
The three-year decline is
the greatest for any three-month period
except for immediately
after World War II when there were a lot
of special circumstances.
M2, if you prefer that, shows a very
similar trend
to what's happening to ODL
in real terms.
So what we have today is we have too
many goods
and too little money and that's the
basic definition
of falling inflation and
I think that the debt problems that
people have
mean that they're going to have to
have to try to force
the businesses to cut their prices, which
they don't want to do.
But the longer they try to hold prices,
the more protracted
this imbalance
between affordability of
critical items to the standard of living
and their
purchase price will continue to persist.
All right, so you said we're now in an
era where we have
too much production and too little money
and I just want to add one other element
that we talked about earlier where it
sounds like you're worried about too
little demand
going forward.
I think the fact that you have to add all these induces
to try to get people to spend
is an indication that the consumer is
not in good shape.
I do not buy the argument the consumer
is resilient.
He's been induced, he's been given
incentives to buy and he's taken the bait,
but it's not to his best
interest to have done what he has done.
And I guess when the chicken comes home
to roost from those
choices that he made that were not in
his favor, buy now pay later being one
great example of that,
it will impair his ability to
purchase more in the future.
It will cause him to
that's the standard definition of debt
and this is a minor technical point,
but the businesses
apparently thought
that these various inducements
to spend in the fourth quarter
would be greater than they actually were
and there was actual inventory building
in the fourth quarter,
which means that the inventories now
rather than being
very lean
are higher than what the corporate
sector anticipated that they would be at
this stage of the game.
Got it. So
we're a step closer to seeing price go
down as they have to try to
move that inventory at some point in
time. All right, so here's one
question we haven't touched on yet on
the corporate side,
which is how concerned are you about the
maturity wall
of debt that's building here?
Corporations have been for in large
part
wisely luckily sitting on balance sheets
where the debt they took on was taken on
when debt was
far cheaper than it is today.
That is beginning to come up for
maturity
and even if Powell delivers
on what he's guiding the market to, if he
delivers on three rate cuts
in 2024 assuming they're all quarter
point rate cuts,
it brings the cost of debt down a
little bit but still
a lot higher than the debt that's
sitting on the books.
So how concerned are you about this in
terms of impairing
corporate profitability and then forcing
corporations to cut costs
including and quite likely probably
perhaps laying people off?
Okay, well whenever you have
extreme monetary
stimulation, extreme monetary excess,
when you have very low rates of
interest, very high rates of monetary
growth,
that you also have excessive risk
taking
and that was clearly the case in 2020
and 2021
and perhaps even in the early part of
2022.
And when people were
taking advantage of those rates,
the credit standards of the business
sector
were considerably better then than they
are now.
And as a consequence, the borrowers
face two problems. Number one,
the AAA rates are higher,
the overnight financing rates, the
SOFR rate is higher,
but the credit standings of a lot of
corporations is far weaker
and so these loans will be rolling over.
And what we don't know,
I've seen numbers that indicate that
approximately one trillion dollars
of corporate debt will mature this year.
I've seen something in that
ballpark.
What we don't know is
the schedule, how much is in
February, how much is in March
and so forth. And
the Federal Reserve is currently
on a path
of a very slow pace of reduction
by small amounts at several discrete
intervals.
But there will be a lot of folks
in February that will need relief in
February and there will be more folks
that will need relief by March and so
forth.
And so it's not just a cost factor,
cost is going up, but a lot of the
people that were making the loans
under the highly favorable conditions in
2020 and 2021
are not going to be willing to roll over.
And we already have seen cases of both
office buildings and apartment units
that have gone into bankruptcy because
the builder had two different
properties, one
not very far from where I live. I can
drive there in less than 10 minutes
in a very good location, very
desirable area.
And they had favorable rates, which
they could not, and the credit rating of
the borrower had deteriorated.
And they simply could not, and moreover
in the case of this particular
builder,
the rents in this area, even in
Austin, Texas,
are coming down. In fact, there's
indication that
contrary to what the Bureau of Labor
Statistics says,
that apartment rents are coming down
nationwide and have been now for several
months.
So the heavily leveraged projects
are under pressure from falling rents or
revenues
and also the fact that the rates are
higher and the credit ratings are lower.
Okay, there's so much I want to talk
with you about on this.
One, just to add on here to get your
thoughts on it if you have any, is
what I've heard too is that CFOs,
I mean they're not idiots. I mean they
loaded up on cheap debt while they
could.
They now see the maturity wall coming
and
they're going to brace for impact. In
other words, they're not going to wait
until the debt matures
at a higher rate and then say, "Okay, what
cuts do I want to make?" They're going to
start making cuts
a quarter or two quarters out in
advance to try to cushion the
impact.
So to your point, we don't know what the
schedule is for 2024 but we know that
the further we get into the year, more
and more companies are going to start
making cost cutting measures to brace
for impact as long as rates are still up
in the territory that they're at right
now.
So
it's not necessarily like we're gonna
have to wait to the end of the year to
see
what actions corporate America takes.
We're probably going to see it
happen in real time in front of us and
as you've already said, we're
seeing some of these properties.
We all know cases that have already
occurred.
I guess you expect it to get
worse, the magnitude of
those measures to get bigger as the
year goes on.
Bankruptcies were up 30% last year
and very substantial even in
the corporate and household with both
sectors.
We've seen a huge increase in consumer
delinquency rates.
It's interesting that
the businesses were making consumer
credit, the banks and the businesses,
were making consumer credit more
available,
although more costly, but more available
even though
the delinquency rate on all of the
consumer loan categories with the
exception of student loans
have doubled over the past year. We're
going up, yeah.
And so that doesn't really describe
a consumer that's in good condition.
They're spending
but they're falling behind on their
loans and
they're actually taking on
obligations which are not justified
given the high level of interest and
also the rate at which wages are
currently increasing.
Okay, so we've talked about the consumer.
We've talked about
the corporate fleet. We haven't really
talked about the government and central
planners and we're not because
that's going to be, I know, a big focus
of your talk for the conference
and
for time reasons, too.
I mentioned earlier I had two
questions for you
around the consumer and we answered one
of them. The second one was
the following, which is
what does history tell us when we have
this -- you get to a point where, like I
said, the bottom 80% or the bottom 90%
are really starting to struggle hard and
they get to the point
where
they're getting dispirited,
they're getting
angry
that the spoils of the economy are
over concentrating into
the pockets of a smaller and smaller
group of elites
and they're really beginning to lose
faith in the social contract
that if I work hard I'm going to
be able to get ahead.
I have a huge worry about this, the toxic
effect of basically
the vast majority of the working
populace just basically throwing in the
towel and say, "There's nothing in it for
me." I think nothing good comes from that
when your society gets to that situation.
I'm not saying we're there exactly right
now but I see the trajectory heading
that direction and I don't see a lot of
signs of hope, at least from what I see,
that we can avoid that or that we're
going to make the right decisions to
avoid that. So if you share that concern,
what does history tell us when we get
into this danger zone? I do share that
concern and I'm going to give you some
numbers that I use.
The critical thing is real
per capita economic activity
and what I do is I take the average
of GDI and GDP
and you have to do that in the current
situation because they're at wide
variance.
They're equivalent concepts, they're at
100% equal but they are not in the way
in which the data is captured.
Now, using the average
of income and spending,
in the 20 years prior to 1970
we grew at 2.2% per annum,
real per capita terms.
In the last 20 years, we're growing at
0.9% per annum.
So we have lost more than 60%
of the rate of growth in per capita
income.
In other words, we've lost
1.3% per annum over the
last 20 years.
Now, what history teaches us is that
when the rate of real per capita
economic activity comes down,
what it does is it exacerbates the income
and wealth divides.
Now, keep in mind what has been
happening during that time.
The degree of monetary and fiscal
operation has become more extreme,
larger and more extreme. We have higher
levels of debt than we've ever had.
We've had more significant swings in
monetary growth
and credit growth than we've ever seen
and are the opposite side, which is debt.
Unfortunately, I think when you stand
back and look at the picture,
what monetary and fiscal policy are
supposed
to modulate the business cycle,
in other words, to make it less severe,
but what the evidence is showing is that
the monetary and fiscal policy
is making the extremes greater.
And in the midst of having
greater and greater extremes,
the overall performance in the economy
is coming down.
Now, if you go back to 1970,
the average in real terms of real per
capita income and GDP
was roughly 66,000.
If we had stayed on our trajectory
of 2.2 percent growth that we had held
in the last 20 years,
right now we would be at about 76
and three quarters thousand dollars,
but we're only at 66,000.
You see, the percent changes may
be small in any individual year,
but they're accumulating over time.
And so the monetary and fiscal
policies
are coming to the rescue, but they are
not
lifting the performance of the economy.
They're interfering
with the performance of the economy.
And the net result is, one of the
sidebars, is that when the Federal
Reserve
engages in financial repression,
what they do is they hold down the
interest rate
of the asset that the majority of
our people hold
in order to finance speculation of the
high rowers.
When governmental policies induce high
inflation,
as they did during the pandemic response,
the burden of the high inflation falls
on those that are least able to protect
themselves.
Right, and just to add insult
to injury,
when that intervention creates
speculative bubbles that then burst, the
perpetrators are the first usually to
get bailed out.
That is correct. That's been a very
unfortunate aspect.
But then when you bail out perpetrators,
then you come to their quick
rescue,
you then take away from the system two
of the important things
that make the free market system work
well. One of them
is moral hazard, and the other is what
the great
economist Jovis Schupeter called
creative destruction.
You have to have this constant,
you have to
attach
risk and reward, and people cannot
assume
that if they take extreme risk,
that
they will benefit, but if they take
extreme risk and lose,
they will still be all right because the
system will bail them out. You do not
have
moral hazard. So in this type of
environment,
you take away two of the most essential
elements
of the free market system, moral hazard
and creative destruction,
and the consequence is that the
rise in the standard of living
is slowed dramatically,
and that's a very unfortunate
event, and I don't think it's good for
the vast majority of our people.
Well, I definitely don't either, and I'm
going to ask you to speculate here, Lacy,
so this isn't a very fair question.
When you look out ahead
the next couple of decades,
do you see
us continuing this trajectory?
I'm going to guess you probably do, but
correct me if that's wrong, but I'm
curious, if you do,
do you see it as just a continued
slow grind downwards, ever downwards in
the
future prosperity prospects for the
masses,
or do you see it getting to some
breaking point
where because we've distorted the system
by removing some of these key elements,
like you mentioned,
the system just sort of breaks
under itself, and
I'm sure that would be a very painful
moment, an event,
but maybe, just maybe, that opens the door
to do things better going forward and we
come out of that to some better
tomorrow. Which of those two trajectories
do you think is more likely? Well,
that's an impossible question, but here
I described to you earlier that we
have a situation of
negative net national
saving,
which is untenable. You're not going to
raise the standard of living if that
persists.
Now, there are fiscal policy solutions,
but they're not even under discussion.
Moreover, they would be contentious,
and because the standard of living
growth is falling and the
income and wealth divides are
exacerbating, there's increasingly
less goodwill,
and so fiscal policy is
largely out of the regime. Well, you say,
well,
monetary policy can come to the rescue.
Well, if you have negative net national
saving, the Federal Reserve can act.
It can accelerate money supply growth,
but to cover a deficit of net
national saving,
you can't cover that by printing money.
You have to have resources to cover it.
In other words, someone has to push back
from the dinner table,
and so at the present time, there is
basically
no agenda that I can see
anywhere on the national level
to alter this trajectory, and so the
standard of living will continue to
crawl lower.
The trend line is downward. We will have
intermittent spurts.
The business cycle is not repealed.
Contrary to former
views, there will be times when we have
brief revival
due to variety of courses, but these
trends are going to be set in place
for a long time.
All right, one last question on this
before we start wrapping things up, which
is,
have we made it even worse by
introducing
we want you guys to be more fiscally
responsible,
but now that the populace has gotten a
taste of, "Oh, when times are tight for me,
I can get a check directly from the
government,"
we very well may have the populace
asking for that type of solution
versus the discipline that's needed.
Well, one of the elements in the
picture is that
if there are any major fall
hits the economy, that they will bring
out the big guns again
and induce the inflation. The inflation
will not be untenable,
will be untenable, and then they'll have
to correct it. In other words,
all this will do is
perpetuate these increasingly violent
cycles,
but without actually improving anyone.
All right, well look,
Lacy,
it's always such a privilege to get to
exchange ideas with you. It is a huge
privilege that you're going to be
keynoting
the Thoughtful Money Conference on
Saturday, March 16th.
Could you just give just a couple
seconds, Lacy, because what we didn't
talk so much about
in this conversation is kind of the
headwaters of the problems or
the headwaters of what drives the
economy, which is the decisions made by
the central planners and whether
it's on the monetary side or the fiscal
side.
I know from your past keynotes
you have just a
a master's level presentation of charts
and all sorts of
economic indicators that you look at
to try to see where the puck is going at
the macro level.
Can you just give folks 20 seconds of
what to expect from you at the
conference?
Well,
I'm basically going to
connect the two critical factors
that
explain why being in a net negative
national saving posture
is going to perpetuate the
falling growth in the standard of
living.
Bring your thinking caps.
The production function is a
universal concept and so is the circular
flow. I'm going to connect them
and I'll be glad to hear what your
investors attending the summit have
to say and
hopefully we'll be able to answer all
their questions.
Great, and at that point you will be able
to hear what they have to say because
folks, there will be a live Q&A, so Lacy
will give his presentation and then has
generously agreed to stick around for
about a half hour's worth of Q&A, so if
that sounds of interest to you folks, go
to thoughtfulmoney.com/conference
to learn more about the conference and
register for it and if you register for
it now you lock in the early bird price
discount. Alright, Lacy, we're just
about done here. I've got one last
question for you which is we've been
talking all about
issues of money and financial
benefit or detriment.
I'd like to ask you a question I've been
asking a lot of my recent speakers here.
What's one non-money related investment
or behavior that you would encourage
people to adopt in their lives?
If they want to live a wealthy life,
yes, money is an important part of it, but
it's not everything in life.
I think there's two things that I would
say.
I've tried to live my life by the golden
rule, do unto others as you would have
them doing it,
and to be as truthful as you can. In
economics that's a really hard thing to
do
because we're looking at models and how
models behave,
but the objective is to be as
forthright as possible.
The other piece of advice that I
would give people
is to keep in mind that economics is a
science.
It's not as precise by any means
as physics and chemistry,
but it is nevertheless a science, and
since it is a science and we can
formulate hypotheses, we can
test the hypotheses, we can determine
whether the hypothesis is true or
untrue or indeterminate,
that one of the important things to know
about economics
is that you have to stay abreast of this
scientific evolution.
What we know today
is not what we will know in the years to
come. Let me just give you a brief
example.
When Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of
Nations in 1776, the founding book
of our profession, he said price was
determined by labor input.
But that's not correct. We know it's
not correct.
Price is determined by the intersection
of demand and supply,
but Smith writes in 1776 that price is
labor content. It's not until
1870s that William
Stanley Jevons gives us the concept of
the demand curve,
a downward sloping demand curve. In other
words, the law of demand is the price of
a good
goes up the quantity demanding falls and
vice versa.
And it's not until 20 years
later
that Alfred Marshall says that
it's not just a matter of the demand
curve, but it's a matter of the
intersection
of demand and supply. We think that's a
basic concept,
but we didn't grasp that all
at once.
And there have been many profound
technological innovations and
advancements in our study in economics
since I was a student,
and there will be many more in the
years to come. And perhaps some of them
that
I won't even be able to imagine.
So stay abreast of the field. It's
ever-changing.
Very good answers. Stay open-minded, stay
curious,
stay hungry for understanding how
thinking is evolving,
and then in addition all that be truthful,
be forthright,
practice the golden rule. I gotta say
Lacy too, others might have picked up on
this, but
in your home office there you have sort
of like a cupola
above your window there and it forms
almost this kind of halo around your
head. So very appropriate for your
guidance here.
I also want to say thank you so much. I
know you should you soldiered through
this discussion with a nasty head cold.
You really left it all on the field
today for the thoughtful
audience. So thank you so much.
And we'll see you in March.
Alright, we'll see you on the 16th of
March. Thanks so much, Lacy.
Bye-bye.
Time on the program where we bring in the
lead partners from New Harbor Financial,
one of the endorsed
financial advisory firms by Thoughtful
Money. I'm joined as usual by lead
partners
Mike Preston and John Lodra.
Gentlemen, love to hear any reaction you
have to that
fantastic discussion with Lacy and then
we can talk perhaps if you've got a few
minutes about what the markets have been
up to
since you guys were last on. Mike, why
don't we start with you?
Thanks, Adam. Well, Lacy's a legend and
yeah, I see why you have him as a
keynote speaker in your
in your annual conferences. He's a
legend. He's been doing what he's
doing for a long time
at Hoisington Investment Management. He's
written, he's authored a couple books
and he has an incredible grasp on the
economic side of things
and on the treasury market. So it's
really a pleasure to tune in and hear
all of his
all of his thoughts. I'd like to just
recap. There's four or five things that I
thought stood out to me
and maybe it'll help your viewers kind
of assimilate what he talked about.
First of all, to your first question
about the worldwide economy,
Lacy said most major economies are in
recession.
GDP, even though it was up 2.9 percent
recently,
is contrasted to gross domestic income
which is really weak.
You know, really it's consumers that
drive the economy and that the majority
of
GDP generally is consumers spending
money or more than 50 percent. I think
I think you might have said more like
70 percent if I remember, but
it's a key part of the economy and gross
domestic income is flat
to down and has been for a while.
High inflation always leads to to
recession.
We have an inverted yield curve. The 210
inversion is somewhat like 0.3 percent
or 30 basis points. It got as high as
one percent. That yield curve is close to
un-inverting. That's another sign of
recession, but
high inflation always leads to
recession. Lacy was pretty clear to point
that out
and we saw incredibly historic
inflation
post-COVID. It pushed up the prices of
cars and homes.
He pointed out in his talk these
prices stay pretty sticky.
They haven't come off yet. It's pretty
surprising to us.
We've seen used car sales prices come
down a little bit, but homes
have stayed really sticky and this is
the problem with inflation is that it's
not
equal for everybody. It really hurts the
low and middle income earners more than
the high income earners. That makes sense
because the low and middle income earners
are using most of their income just to
live.
The high income earners have lots of
extra even if things cost more for the
basics.
So it's not really fair, but they also
have assets that can benefit from
inflation or at least be
protected from inflation. They own assets
that generate rents that can be adjusted
upwards with inflation,
for example, or they own hard assets that
tend to hold their purchasing power
more where a lot of the middle class and
lower classes, they don't have that
shielding.
All they get to feel is the impact of
the high, the rising costs. Absolutely.
Absolutely. You know, Lacy said that
monetary and these, I think his words,
monetary intervention is interfering
with the economy
and inflation, like you just said, it kind
of holds down
the assets that people own and it rises
the assets of speculators. So it's not
really fair. It's been happening since
2008, probably before, but it really has
gone into hyperdrive ever since.
Lastly, you know, Lacy said that the
standard of living is not going up for
most people. It's actually going down.
I think that you can take a look at this
in charts, even on the
St. Louis Fed website, there's charts
about
the different quartiles or
deciles, you know, the share of total
income
has been going down for mid to lower
earners and it's gone
vertical for high earners and that's
been going on for more than 10 years. So
really the punchline is that a reduction
in standard of living for the masses
has been happening ever so slowly and
unfortunately, if the recession actually
hits and assets take a big dive at
the stock market crashes, it will
disproportionately hurt those that kind
of
stayed out of this ride. So it's,
nobody knows the solution. All
we can really do is talk about it here
every week and point it out
and say it's not a great system
and there's very little that the
individual can do except to reduce risk
and pay off debt,
raise some cash, buy some real assets,
gold and silver,
real estate, if you can find real estate
that's not overvalued.
So I think I'll pause there but
basically those are my takeaways.
It's a system that is broken, it's pushed
to the limit,
it's scary, and all we can do is kind of
simplify our lives and be careful.
Good summary, Mike. A few things I just
want to pull out on there. One, you know,
Lacy said, look,
when I asked, "Hey,
the top economists, the
Janet Yellen's of the world,
are saying, "Hey, it's going to be a
great year 2024." Everyone's
calling for soft landing or no landing,
that's the big debate.
You've got the GDP number that came in
hot,
harder than expected, the
official jobs number is still low or
unemployment rate is still low,
inflation is trending downwards,
so there's a lot of people beginning to
take a victory lap
kind of on the the mainstream economist
side.
Lacy is saying, "No, we're not out of the
woods yet."
In fact, for all the reasons you just
mentioned, Mike, he's expecting
the economy to go into contraction.
There was one other
important indicator that wasn't on
your list. I just want to flag here for
folks where he said,
"We're in the only eighth time since 1929
where the country has
a negative national savings rate
and
every single time
prior to now that has preceded a
recession or contraction in the economy."
So something would have to be very
different this time for that not to be
the case again.
So anyways, he's just basically saying,
"Hey folks, don't get caught up in the
FOMO that's going on right now in the
markets and don't get lulled by the
headlines that are comforting and
cheering what's going on.
You got to be
skeptical and defensive."
One of the things I want to say about Lacy in
particular, he's a great man,
obviously comes across to anybody that
just watched the interview we just did,
but I get to talk with Lacy from time to
time and we have deep talks about what
Lacy got into today, which is
most economists,
they sort of are academics, they sort of
live in their ivory tower of equations
look at the world if it's this perfect
system
and just like to fall in love in
their models.
Lacy actually really cares about regular
people and came out really
clearly in today's discussion, which you
don't really hear many economists
willing to do,
is saying, "Hey look, what we've got
going on here is not healthy from a
social perspective.
We are basically eroding prosperity for
a growing amount for a majority and a
growing majority
of our populace," and you heard
me kind of press around with him a
little bit. I'm like, "Well,
what does history say when that happens
in the past?" and basically a shorthand
to that is nothing good. So I know that
he is
concerned at the heart level about
the plight of the majority of the
American populace and
sadly,
like me, I tell him, "Look Lacy, I don't
see a lot of hope." I'd love to be
able to point to a few things and say,
"Oh, well this is how we're going to
actually avoid a bad ending here.
Here's the reason for hope in the story
where the bottom 80%, 90%
starts to fare better and we get more
into balance and we get to put into
reverse this wealth gap that's going
on. I just don't see that and sadly
neither does he." So I want to just
underscore that a man as erudite and
experienced as Lacy doesn't yet see the
solution here
or at least the solution that
avoids a lot of pain. Maybe the system
really cracks under its weight at some
point in time and when the dust settles
we make smarter decisions but
man, that's going to involve an awful
lot of pain here. So
I just wanted to underscore the fact
that this
great economist who could just sort of
act like all the other academics is
basically saying, "Hey folks, we really
need to be concerned here." So on that
depressing note, John, let me hand it to
you.
Yeah, thanks Adam and great to be with
you again here. I really like Lacy. He
obviously has an
encyclopedic command of the economic
data and cycles
and he just seems like a genuinely good
guy. I loved his parting
with words of wisdom about the golden
rule and humility.
He talked about how economic
models and theories that for in their
time were
rock-solid dogma have
come to pass because there's been
innovation and that scares me a little
bit. Innovation in the economic
science, for example, a hundred years
after Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, it
wasn't until a hundred years later that
the whole
concept of supply and demand as a
determinant of price came
into being. So it's good that he
recognizes that
economists are fallible and
their dogma is not always right on.
That scares me too because
if the last decade is any guide,
from our vantage point, the central
bankers have all but thrown away
the rules. They threw away things like
the Taylor Rule and have really just
been shooting from the hip and then you
get theories like modern monetary
theories. I think there's a
positive and a scary element to this
idea of innovation from an economic model
standpoint.
But look, we here at New Harbor, Mike
and I and our team,
we're managing money for people
and this money has real important
purpose in their life, not only to fund
their lifestyles but
hopefully be a source of pride and
safety and stability in their lives and
what is otherwise a pretty uncertain
world. And so we
work really hard to take in a lot of
perspectives. Certainly the economic
cycle and
economic data is important stuff.
Here we are today and
I think this is going to air the next
day after we report it, Adam, but here
we're waiting on
yet another Fed announcement and policy
and so it definitely drives
markets and
market's reactions. But from a
day-to-day and a true
investment management standpoint,
economic data and cycles are really good
timing tools, right? Just like valuations
aren't but they set a very important
backdrop on which
we guide our investment decisions on
behalf of clients.
And I think it's really fitting to think
about things as we do like a
football game.
Our job in some ways we
think is like that of a
football coach. We need to determine
what field, what team is
on the field. Are we putting the
offensive team on or are we putting the
defensive team on?
And I did a video about a week ago on
our own YouTube channel that gets into
more depth of some of the indicators but
bottom line is there are times in
markets despite what the economy is
saying.
In fact, if you look at
a long-term chart of the S&P 500
for example and
look at it relative to recessions, the
market almost always
peaks like right before recession is
declared as if the market has no ability
to foresee it.
Sorry to interrupt but this is the the
famous conversation I've had with Darius
Dale where
basically the party
gets to its
raging apex right before the cops
arrive. That seems to be what happens
with the S&P.
No, it doesn't mean the economic data and
being aware of it isn't important. It's
really important because the consequence
on the other side of those peaks is what
is baked into the cake just like
valuations bake that into the cake.
What it does is sets a backdrop of
the tone or the kinds of plays so we can
be on offense so to speak
and just like any and we're about a
week away from the Super Bowl so this is
a great timing to talk about football.
By the way, here's a
sentimental indicator. I just saw the
the record high prices for Super Bowl
tickets. If
people are looking for signs of excess
just look at where Super Bowl ticket
prices are right now record highs.
Anyways, we can be
running offensive plays but
just like a head coach if
your team has its own back to your own
goal line you're going to run some
pretty darn conservative play. You're not
going to
do some risky screen passes where it's
an easy interception for the other team
to step
two yards into your end zone. You're
going to run certain kinds of
defensive plays and it might be that
you keep
the real short-term
looking for two-yard gains not
breakout plays. That's what our suite of
indicators, valuations and some of our
shorter term technical indicators. We've
got a whole battery of
technical indicators we look at that
helps us build a weight of the
evidence
assessment and again I talk about it in
that video on our on our own
web YouTube page.
That's where valuations
and economic data come in. It doesn't
necessarily say we're on offense or
defense it just kind of flavors the
kinds of plays we'll run. So
what does it mean right now? Well we're
underweight equities. We have about
roughly 40% give or take in equities
right now.
But we have almost all of that hedged in
some way either through some
put options or call options because
we do think even though the short-term
indicators are suggesting we're on
offense there is
you know it's a high-risk environment to
be running offense. So we're playing it
safe by having underweight equities
and what we do have is in areas that
are showing relative strength
and hedging and and we'll call the plays
as as things evolve.
But let me just share a chart here to
kind of put things in perspective
because valuations do
do matter in the end state and you know
just I'll just like to flash up a
current
long-term chart of the Schiller PE ratio.
You know here we are beginning January
of this year almost 33.
You go back all of history to the late
1800s. There are only a couple times in
history the great depression right
before the great depression.
Which is where we are right now. Yeah so
we're on par and
and even if you you know obviously the
tech bubble here
was quite a bit higher but if you adjust
for things like corporate margins and
assume
kind of reliable mean reversion that has
always over long-term periods
happened these are actually quite close
to each other in terms of
adjust margin adjusted valuations.
Right here is where the tech bubble I
mean the housing bubble emanated from so
we you know we can have
major declines in the market for much
lower valuations.
But let me just show you kind of a the
next chart just shows a
kind of a real world scenario of it's
very simplified of course but I just
want to kind of drive home for folks
that are
sitting very very heavily invested maybe
passively and thinking that hey it's
just about closing your eyes and
riding off into the sunset. This shows
that what what you know investing at
high valuations
can can do in terms of devastating a
retirement income scenario. So this just
shows two scenarios.
1982 where we had Schiller PE of seven
you know
generational low in the Schiller PE
versus 2000 the tech bubble over 42.
And these are the actual returns in the
S&P for the next 15 years.
And this just simply shows if you
started with a million dollars and
experienced these kind of annual returns
and took out an inflation adjusted five
percent withdrawal rate
per year so the first year is 50,000 next
year is 51,000.
You know in this scenario where you have
starting low valuations and
consequently very strong follow-on
returns average return of about 13.3
percent over that 15-year period
you know you can sustain these
withdrawals and look at this ending
value keeps keeps growing because you
have this
really favorable valuation environment
where you're investing.
Contrast that with the year 2000 where
you had extremely high valuations
and you know very poor returns right out
of the gate and that that's where
negative returns
emanate from not not to the day but they
they come from areas of overvaluation
like we're in right now.
And vastly different picture average
return of about 4.1 percent but more
devastatingly this same withdrawal
scenario ends up running out of money.
This is a very simplified example of why
the stakes are so high.
So I'll stop sharing here and it's just
a you know a call of caution.
This economic data the valuation data is
important to
to even if you're running office do it
very defensively
if I could use that kind of paradoxical
statement and that's what we're trying
to do for clients right now.
So I guess I'll just pause there. I
really like that chart you just put up
there
John because as you like to tell us you
know people don't retire for a year
they retire for the rest of their lives
and so a huge question you have to ask
yourself
if you're building wealth to fund say a
retirement
is okay you know how long is that money
going to be available to me
and that's a function of a how much
you've saved up before you decide to
retire but it's also a function of the
environment that you retire in
and based on your earlier chart
with the case Shiller there it's hard
to argue that we're not in one of the
most
richly valued moments for financial
assets in history
and so we got to be very cautious of
that. So if you're thinking about
retiring anytime soon you really got to
take
the lesson of your chart into account
which is to say hey
if the future plays out
any way like history did am I in danger
of running out of my
my wealth I'm counting on uh sooner than
I'm expecting right?
Yeah a special call to action for folks
who have accounts that they don't think
about often
old retirement accounts you know it's
common to get
busy with life and forget about things
and maybe they're 100% in stocks and you
don't really want them to be
this is a great time to be thinking
about taking a checkup of those kinds of
uh accounts that maybe are out of your
out of your mind on a daily basis. Good
point now I want to um
I just want to go back to your football
analogy for a second
because as people start doing well you
know you get more comfortable
right and I'm sure there's a lot of
people that are looking at their account
balances now versus say six months ago
and saying oh hey you know I dodged a
bullet doing pretty well now
less worried about the future um maybe
if I'm getting really excited because my
my stocks have been on a tear the past
couple months right
I just want to I just want to give them
the uh example of what just happened to
the lions.
I live out in the San Francisco Bay area
they were playing the 49ers this weekend
uh and you know early in the game the
lions actually got a commanding lead
and it seemed like they had the game in
the bag
uh and and you could see as the 49ers
started coming back
and chopping away at that lead uh it was
almost a sense of disbelief
that like well surely this can't happen
we had such a great lead we were so
strong out of the gate the Niners were
crushed
and eventually the Niners ended up
winning the game right uh and uh you
know
disaster for Detroit um again it just
it was like their eyes couldn't believe
what they were seeing on the field
sometimes the same thing can happen
in uh in investing in fact it probably
happens a lot more in investing where
you feel like you're in great shape
because your stocks just went on a great
run
you make your plans based on that then
all of a sudden you know market
fundamentals express themselves
the game suddenly changes and you know
people lose a lot more money a lot
faster than they expect and obviously
the whole reason why we
we have these videos and we have the
financial advisors on here is to keep
folks grounded and hopefully help folks
diminish their potential vulnerability
to that happening but you're nodding as
i'm saying this john
yep great analogy adam thank you all

of practice because it's been so long
but yes
uh for those that haven't yet heard we
have reactivated
uh the free consultations with
thoughtful money's endorsed financial
and jonathan well i'm at rocklink so um
in this type of environment um lacy did
a great job of explaining all the
challenges that he sees lying ahead
it's really hard for the average person
to figure out how to navigate all this
we highly recommend
that you work with a good professional
financial advisor who's in good
standing with the regulatory authorities
um
that is a subset of the universe in and
of itself
uh but then we highly recommend you work
with one that
that takes into account all the macro
issues that lacy and i talked about all
the other guests on this channel and i
talk about
when you add that requirement the
universe really really shrinks
um so anyways if you've got a good one
who's doing that for you
uh and being a good steward of your
wealth great stick with them but if you
don't
um or would like a second opinion from
one who does maybe even john and mike
themselves
consider scheduling a free consultation
with the financial advisors that are
endorsed by thoughtful money
as mike said to do that just go to
thoughtfulmoney.com
fill out the short form there these
consultations are totally free
there's no commitment to work with these
guys it's just a public service that
john and mike and
other financial advisors offer uh just to
help make people more informed and help
them make better decisions you can take
that information and you can
take a diy strategy yourself you can
bring it to your your other
uh your existing portfolio manager if
you want or if you
like what you hear from these guys you
can continue talking with them but
anyways john and mike
always a pleasure thanks so much for
doing this with me every week
everybody else thanks so much for
watching
