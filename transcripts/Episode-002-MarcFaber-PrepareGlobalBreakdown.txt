 financial assets, if we look at the period 1981-82 to, say, 2020, during that period
 of time, both bonds and stocks returned superior returns.
 In other words, it was heaven for financial assets for almost 40 years.
 And I think this period of heavenly conditions for financial assets has come to an end at
 the end of 2021, January 2022, that's the peak of the stock market.
 And from here on, returns will be, for most people, disappointing.
 Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
 I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
 Well, folks, here we find ourselves at a doorstep, here with a brand new YouTube channel designed
 to educate and empower the regular investor to navigate what lies ahead, while at the
 same time, a very murky, very uncertain future is unfolding before us.
 And when the road ahead is hard to discern, it's wise to tap the counsel of those with
 a strong command of the lessons of history and the practical experience of a lifetime
 in the market trenches.
 There are a few who fit that description better than Dr. Mark Fauber, editor and publisher
 of the Gloom, Boom and Doom report.
 I can't imagine a better mind to kick off this new channel with.
 Colorful, brash and brilliant, Mark understands the global economy through a historical lens
 practically unmatched in the industry.
 And he's a declarative straight shooter who doesn't mince words.
 Mark, thanks so much for being my first interview on Thoughtful Money.
 It's a great honor.
 Thank you very much.
 Well, thanks, and look, as folks can see, new background, new studio, we're still getting
 a few things put into place, but we are building the race car as we're driving it here.
 Thank you again for being the first person to see me.
 Well, look, Mark, I usually start these interviews at the high level, and then I kind of drill
 down into more granular topics.
 I think I want to flip the script this time with you, because there are so many big macro
 topics right now that I want to get your insights on.
 So let's start with your macro outlook, your outlook for the economy, and your outlook
 for the markets.
 And then I want to get even higher than that if we've got time.
 So first off, why don't we start with this?
 We're talking here in November of 2023, a new year looms ahead.
 As you look out, what do you see in your forecast in terms of how you expect the economy to
 perform next year globally?
 Well, I think I have to clarify how I look at the economy.
 When I talk about the strong economy, it means that GDP per capita of the majority of people
 increases.
 And if I talk about the weakening economy, it is that the GDP per capita in real terms,
 that is inflation adjusted, diminishes.
 And you can observe this, you just have to talk to your friends or to people.
 Or if you have a business like you have, and I have, we pay out salaries and so forth.
 And we also have costs, and we can look at the cost increases every year.
 Or in some cases, costs are coming down.
 And in general, we have as a businessman, you have a relatively good feel about what
 the cost of living increases are.
 And if they are actually cost of living decreases, say, if in a country rents declined by 30%,
 a major burden on people's household income is relieved because they pay less rent, then
 we have to obviously also analyze in that society, how many people own the houses and
 how many people rent and so forth.
 So there are lots of variables in an economy.
 And we can have interest rate increases.
 If you have money and you have a lot of cash, it benefits you.
 On the other hand, if you have a lot of credit outstanding, and credit card debts that are
 variable, it will hurt you.
 On the other hand, if you have a house with a fixed rate mortgage, it doesn't hurt you
 all that much and so forth.
 But in general, what I observe among people, and I live in Asia, but the economies of Asia
 and Europe and the US are similar, but what I observe is that for most people, the cost
 of living have increased more than the salaries.
 And they are not as well off, let's say they have less spending power than before.
 Now statistically, the government can show that spending goes up, retail sales are going
 up and so forth.
 But if most of it is price increases or inflation, as some people would contend, then the real
 gains are not very high.
 And secondly, if I look at macroeconomic indicators in the world, most countries report figures
 that would indicate essentially a stagnation in economic activity.
 And in some cases, you can visibly see that the incomes are going down.
 In other words, the standards of living are going down for most people.
 So the outlook is murky, it's not very favorable.
 Having said that, as an investor, I always look at opportunities.
 And it's interesting that in the worst economic situations, occasionally great opportunities
 arise.
 I mean, we have at the present time, strikingly, emerging markets having underperformed the
 US for many years, maybe 10 years since 2009.
 And as a result, emerging markets have become inexpensive compared to the US.
 Or you take in the US, you have a very high valuation of technology.
 On the other hand, material stocks, and especially energy and energy related stocks are relatively
 cheap.
 They're not absolutely cheap, cheap as they were in 2009 or 2003.
 But as I compared to technology stocks, energy stocks are relatively low.
 And we had this huge debacle in the bonds market, where 30 year treasuries have tumbled
 now for three years in a row, they just started to rally.
 I think this rally may carry on for a while.
 But the low in interest rates we had in May, August 2020, I think these lows will stand
 and from here on, we are in a rising inflation wave and in a rising interest rate structure.
 But it can extend over 20, 30 years, the way this inflation lasted essentially 40 years.
 So these are long term trends, but they're interrupted by counter moves.
 So I could argue in 10 years time interest rates will be higher.
 But I could argue over the next next six months interest rates will come down.
 You understand that it creates the volatility that we have in markets, which is relatively
 high.
 All right, great intro.
 There's lots and lots I want to dig into there.
 So let me just sort of take it in order then.
 So you talked about how it sort of depends who you are in the story in terms of how well
 you're faring.
 If you've got a fixed mortgage, if you've got inflation adjusting income streams, you're
 probably doing pretty well or at least you're not that worried.
 If you're kind of a regular person, a regular wage earner feeling the full force of the
 increase in cost of living we've had over the past couple of years, you're probably
 finding it harder and harder to hang on.
 I had Michael Kantrowitz while in my previous program recently and he talked about this
 bifurcation.
 He was sort of talking about it in the economy, which is sort of a milestone you see before
 you head into recession as some parts of the economy remain doing well while others start
 to roll over.
 But I think you're talking to almost more of sort of a socioeconomic bifurcation here,
 which is that, and it's not news to anybody, but the wealthy, the top 10% are continuing
 to do fine and maybe even on a relative basis their prospects are getting even better.
 But the vast majority of folks worldwide seem to be looking at diminished prospects from
 here.
 Am I capturing your outlook correctly here?
 Yes, correct.
 And especially I think as an investor who has a longer term horizon, let's say as a
 stock investor, you'd always think, "Well, are these stocks going to give me a decent
 return over the next 10 years compared to, say, cash or compared to gold or compared
 to real estate?"
 I have to say financial assets, if we look at the period 1981-82 to, say, 2020, during
 that period of time, both bonds and stocks returned superior returns.
 In other words, it was heaven for financial assets for almost 40 years.
 And I think this period of heavenly conditions for financial assets has come to an end at
 the end of 2021, January 2022, that's the peak of the stock market.
 And from here on, returns will be, for most people, disappointing.
 Not necessarily for me because my return expectations are, say, around 4-5% per annum.
 But for people who are aiming at like 10-12% returns, I think they will be disappointed.
 And if I look at the stock market, a few stocks have been very strong, the Fang and Fang related
 stocks, but the typical stock hasn't done very much.
 And I run broad portfolios of stocks in Europe, in Asia, and in mining companies and so forth.
 For every stock that moves up, another one breaks down somewhere.
 So there's every day at least something to be positive about and something to be negative
 about.
 But overall portfolios haven't done well.
 Right.
 And of course, that's what makes a market, right?
 As an active investor, your goal is to try to have more of those wins than the losses.
 But listening to you, Marc, I'm kind of taking away, maybe I should restate what I said earlier,
 which is I'm getting the sense that you think maybe almost everybody is going to be kind
 of disappointed in the coming era, meaning it's not going to be as easy to have those
 heavenly financial returns in the big financial assets, which of course are concentrated in
 the hands of the top 10% of households anyways.
 So stocks go up, really doesn't benefit the average guy all that much, but it does benefit
 the top 10% who own, I think, what, 90% of the financial assets.
 So you're saying there's going to be headwinds on financial asset appreciation from here.
 And I think from what I'm taking from what you're saying about sluggish economic growth
 going forward, higher inflation, higher cost of capital in general, the general economy
 is not going to grow as much and that's not good for the bottom 90% of folks.
 So I don't want to be too depressing here, but I mean, are we kind of looking at a rougher
 decade plus ahead than we've enjoyed?
 Well, I think to answer your question, the best is to travel through an airport nowadays
 and compare it to traveling, say, pre-COVID or 10 years ago, airports have become unpleasant
 experiences.
 There's no question about this and there are delays at airlines and there are lost luggages
 and a lot of different things are much worse than they used to be.
 And I think this is the kind of pattern we all have to get used to live with, that will
 earn less than we had expected, things infrequently will cost more for lower quality, or we'll
 have to live with higher services costs and lower service providers.
 In other words, everything is becoming more inconvenient.
 Nothing is becoming more convenient.
 And you'll have also these conflicts in the world that may last for a long time and be
 costly that people don't realize you can finance the war in two ways.
 You can essentially, or should, you should increase taxation because if you told people
 a war will cost this and that much from your income, people wouldn't go to war.
 But because the government is used to lie, they will not do it through higher taxes,
 they'll have inflation.
 Inflation is a tax that comes up through deficits of the government.
 In other words, the government spends more than they collect in taxation, and then you
 get inflationary pushes, especially if you have friendly central banks that will finance
 the deficits.
 And on that point, so right now, the central banks have been more than friendly over the
 past 20 years in general and they've been practically lecherous, but right now they
 are showing a rare restraint because of inflation.
 I like to interrupt here.
 You say they're showing restraint.
 This is correct in the sense that the cost of money through the rise in interest rates
 has gone up.
 Okay.
 That we can all agree.
 Yep.
 Where we need to be very careful is to determine whether money is tight or not.
 As you know, last week we had very, very significant bounces in stocks.
 I mean, some stocks bounced back by 10 percent in one day, like gold shares or stocks that
 were depressed, they jumped 10 percent over three days.
 Is money tight when this happens?
 I doubt.
 I think money is more expensive, but isn't tight yet.
 Normally, a sign of really tight money would be if spreads between high yield bonds and
 treasuries explodes, has not happened yet, hasn't happened.
 And volatility index has been in low range.
 It increased until about a week ago, but then it also collapsed by 37% in just three days.
 So I want to have you comment on this, then.
 So I've talked recently about how right now most of the central banks are pressing their
 foot down on the economic breaks.
 They're raising the cost of capital, they're doing QT.
 But at the same time, especially here in the US, we have the fiscal side jamming on the
 accelerator with these sort of worst high deficits when we're not mobilized in a war.
 So we have this conflict right now, and all that fiscal stimulus is goosing, it's getting
 out in the real economy here.
 So is that what's creating this scenario right here?
 To a large extent, yes.
 If you analyze really GDP growth, and then you analyze the credit growth of the government
 in the US, you would find that the increase in government debt vastly exceeds the increase
 in GDP.
 Nominal terms.
 It just means it gets worse for us because the benefit of additional debt is diminishing
 and diminishing and diminishing, right?
 Yes, yes, correct.
 And number two, I have to say this about the fiscal deficit.
 Transfer payments, let's say if the government gives you money, because you have a child,
 or because the government thinks that you need a housing allowance, and so forth.
 It's an intervention in the economy.
 And it then enlarges the government at the expense of the private sector.
 Now, you and I, in our economic education, we have to believe something.
 Now, I admit, there are people who believe in big government, they think the big government
 is good for economic growth.
 But my experience having looked at economies that were previously ultra big government,
 the communist governments, the socialist government of Eastern Europe, all these economies were
 left behind compared to the free market economies of Western Europe, and the US and Canada and
 Australia.
 So I have to believe that free markets and the capitalistic system are the best way to
 grow an economic system.
 I'm not saying the capitalistic system is ideal.
 But it is the best system we can have that combines growth and freedom.
 You understand, under socialism, and communism, in theory, you could have prosperity, but
 you have less freedom.
 Because the state will tell you what to do, the state, the government has a monopoly over
 all assets, they own everything, you don't own anything.
 And they control the corporate world and they say to you, you can work here or there.
 But you have no choice.
 It's the government that tells you to do things, whereas in the capitalistic system, I admit
 that there are some slaves in the capitalistic system that are enslaved by excessive debt.
 So they have to wait for the check, the monthly paycheck, to pay their credit card debts,
 the interest on the credit cards, these people are somewhat enslaved.
 But most people in the capitalistic system, whatever their position is, it's a choice.
 Right.
 And they have more potential, at least to improve their state.
 Yes, exactly.
 Now, I'm not saying everybody because somebody in the capitalistic system could get sick,
 or have an injury, then they have no choice anymore.
 But we have in the capitalistic system, we had already in the 19th century kind of associations
 that were helping the poor.
 Nowadays we have social security and health insurance and so forth and so on.
 But in general, I would say, if we can agree among us that free markets are preferable
 to the state monopolies, if we agree to that, then we have to also agree that small government
 is better than huge government, huge meaning the communist planned economy, and entirely
 free markets would be the rubber baron days of America in the 19th century, which were
 outstanding in terms of economic growth, they also created disparities, but they created
 a huge increase in per capita, real per capita GDP.
 Because like, let's say people like Carnegie, or Rockefeller, and Vanderbilt, they lowered
 the cost of production, and through trains and refrigeration, you could ship meat from
 Abilene and then later on Chicago to the East Coast at lower and lower cost, transportation
 costs fell in the 19th century.
 So it benefited actually everybody.
 And why did so many people move to America?
 Because wages in America were higher than in Europe.
 That was the reason.
 Alright, Mark, so remember when I talked about how I wanted to take this at a level and then
 move it higher?
 You're heading exactly in the direction that I wanted to, and just to show my hand here,
 I think we can make an argument, I'd like to talk about it with you in a few minutes,
 that if you look at the trajectory of Western governments, it is looking like they are perhaps
 becoming less free market driven, and less personal freedom driven versus more.
 And I want to get your thoughts on that.
 But before we get there, to summarize what you're saying, I'm going to paraphrase and
 murder the paraphrase, I believe it was Winston Churchill or someone like him who said, "Capitalism
 is the worst solution that we have, except it's better than all the other ones."
 It's the best of the worst.
 It's not perfect.
 It's not perfect.
 But I mean, I recommend you viewers or listeners.
 It's not a difficult book to read.
 If they find it difficult to read, they can listen to some lectures by Milton Friedman.
 The book is called Capitalism and Freedom.
 This is now really the kind of sort of Bible you should read to understand what governments
 does and the fact is simply in the 19th century, by 1910, none of the industrialized countries
 of the West had the government that was spending more than 12% of GDP.
 Now it's around 50%.
 And as the government expands, growth shrinks, it's logical.
 And as the government expands, freedom diminishes.
 I mean, I think people, I talk to a lot of people wherever they are, and they say, look,
 you live in Thailand here, you don't have any voting rights, but life is relatively
 free.
 When I go to Switzerland, I have to be careful.
 I don't drive anymore because we have speed limits of 30 kilometers in the city.
 If you push on the accelerator of any car, you're at 15 split seconds.
 I have constant tickets and parking ticket.
 And then you can't do this here and you can't do that there.
 And then there's very little freedom in the end.
 All right, well, look, I want to put a pin in that because I want to get more deeply
 into that.
 Just a couple quick things to wrap up the economy side.
 One, your comments here are making me think of conversation I had with Lacy Hunt just
 a few weeks back.
 He was giving a presentation at my recent conference and showing how the government
 multiplier is actually negative and that's essentially what you're saying, not only to
 economic growth, but to freedom as well.
 All right, so Mark, just to kind of wrap up the money side of the discussion here, just
 a couple of rapid fire questions for you because I know that people are going to have a hard
 time moving on until we scratch this itch for them.
 As you look into 2024, you mentioned that a lot of the indicators that you're seeing
 right now, economic indicators suggest stagnation.
 Do you see us being able to avoid a recession in the next relatively near term, year plus
 or so, or do you expect a lag effect of the dramatic increase in cost of capital that's
 gone on plus the slowing economy to really start pulling economic growth down into recession?
 I think most people are already in recession, but they may not notice it because the salaries
 are going up, but the salaries are going up less than the cost of living.
 So to answer your view is, I don't think we can avoid a recession.
 But what I believe is that for the next six months or so, the rate of inflation will not
 be very high unless we have an escalation of wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine.
 That is a wild card.
 But other than that, if we can kind of keep it on a low burning level, these conflicts,
 then the rate of inflation should come down temporary.
 But long term, if you look at the pattern of the '70s, we had three waves of inflation.
 The first wave until '69, then we cooled down until '72, then another wave until '74, and
 then a cooling down until '76.
 The final wave was the strongest wave, the third wave that led to a very high rate of
 inflation.
 And I think looking at countries like Turkey and Argentina, I wouldn't be surprised in
 the world if in 10 years time, our inflation rates would be very high, very high, maybe
 30, 40%, maybe higher.
 Sorry, are you talking about Turkey and Argentina or are you talking 30 to 40% inflation amongst
 the major currencies, like the dollar or the euro?
 Yes.
 I was referring if Turkey and Argentina can survive with inflation rates of 100% or so,
 we could have in the Western world inflation rates of 30, 40% quite easily.
 Okay, I'm going to talk some of my questions in the future that we're going to talk about
 and get to the specter of sort of a social uprising because this populace is getting
 so injured that they eventually just have no choice.
 When you start talking about 30 or 40% inflation, I have a hard time seeing that not happening.
 Well, I mean, I'd say the government today in the Western world, or the governments,
 they have three choices.
 They all have deficits, okay, so they can solve the deficit question as follows.
 They could cut down spending meaningfully, okay.
 So you, my representative and diplomatic chief, you go and explain the veterans of the military
 and of the police force and of the firemen.
 You explain to them that in future, they'll get 20-30% less pensions, right?
 So you'll see what kind of social unrest you'll get.
 You'll get, and so that's one option, right, which I think no politician would ever do
 unless, you know, someone was holding a gun to their head.
 The socialist communists, they can do that if the state owns everything, but the easier
 way is to go.
 That's one way, cut spending meaningfully.
 It's practically not possible.
 The other way is to increase taxation meaningfully.
 It's very difficult because the rich will always find ways not to pay taxes, in the
 whole history of mankind, tax evasion was the favorite pastime.
 And there's only one tax that is popular in the world's history is a tax on your neighbor,
 not on you.
 And that has a limit too, because you can only tax your pockets up to some point where
 they say, no way, no more, right?
 Yes, you can't bankrupt your neighbor, otherwise you get the worst one.
 The third way and the easiest one in every society has been to print money.
 This is the way to come out.
 And I mean, I have a book this I recommend to your viewers as well.
 Maybe I've mentioned it before.
 You see, this man was an Italian, but he was working for the Reichsministerium in the years
 1918 to 1923, his name is Constantino Preciano Turroni, he was a famous economist.
 And the book is The Economics of Inflation.
 And he analyzes the impact of inflation on stock prices, on the currency, on precious
 metals, on society and on wealth inequality and wealth concentration.
 Everything is described in details.
 This is the Bible, everyone needs to read if he wants to understand the causes and the
 effects of inflation on society.
 Anyway, the impact on society is not very favorable.
 It sounds like sadly, you're very confident that this is the pathway of the future of
 the world's major economies.
 When I look at the central banks, what characters are running central banks?
 Yes, this would be my conclusion.
 When I look at the power that governments have acquired and their unwillingness to cut
 spending, because you understand the bureaucracy has always been a big problem in the organization
 of a society.How do you get a department like the police force to reduce its size by 30%?
 How do you get the firemen to cut down spending by 30% is very difficult.
 And people always that this is something.
 That's why I brought up this book, Capitalism and Freedom.
 You can only have freedom if you are prepared to assume responsibility.
 If each time it rains, or there is a fire somewhere, or an earthquake somewhere in the
 world, if each time you say the government should do this, the government should do that,
 then you ask for the government to become big.
 It's the Ben Franklin, "Those who trade security for freedom deserve neither."
 Yes, this is the issue of freedom versus security.
 If you want to ensure everything you can, in principle, but you will have very little
 money left if you ensure everything.
 But the point I want to make is young people today, and maybe at the time I grew up, it
 was similar, but not as extreme as it is today.
 Today, young people have great aspirations, or they have great expectations, but are not
 prepared to offer sacrifices.
 In other words, you understand, if you want to be wealthy, the number one condition is
 you have to work hard.
 Because the world has 8 billion people, and I can assure you, there are lots of people
 in this world who are willing to work 50 hours, 60 hours, 80 hours a week.
 So if someone says I want to be rich and work 35 hours, forget it, it's not going to work.
 Now someone will say, "No, it works because I won the lottery."
 Yes, there are always exceptions, but I'm talking about an entire society becoming affluent.
 Rome became affluent because they were very disciplined initially, and virtue in Rome
 was a very important quality in your behavior.
 I'm not sure that we're more virtuous than we are, but it was expected that the citizen
 would really work for the general good of Rome.
 He would be a soldier, he would be a statesman, and so forth.
 So it was a culture that was energy-driven.
 When the empire failed, it was also because it spent too much money.
 Because nobody wanted to pay tax, they printed money.
 There's a saying out there, I'm sure most viewers are familiar with it, that you're
 just hammering on right here, Mark.
 This is the hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create
 weak men, weak men create hard times.
 I agree, I think the younger generations perhaps exhibit what you're talking about.
 To be honest though, Mark, I would say in the West, I would say almost all living generations
 don't have the backbone or the diligence or the work ethic that say the greatest generation
 had, the generation that fought World War I, World War II, rebuilt the world after World
 War II.
 I think we've all sort of lost the hustle, the work ethic, the communal sense of shared
 sacrifice to be building something greater for everybody but still leave the door open
 for individual achievement.
 That's my own personal thoughts.
 I'm curious to hear what yours would be.
 My father's generation, my grandfather's generation, and also myself, we were brought
 up relatively frugally and with hard work.
 I mean, it wasn't an option for me when I finished my studies to say, oh, I'm not going
 to work and take a holiday or, you know, take it easy for a while.
 So society expected me to go and get a job and I wanted to do it because I knew one of
 the things that disturbed me throughout my school years from primary school to college
 and so forth was the lack of freedom and why?
 Because I need the money from my parents.
 If I wanted to go to the movie, I had to get pocket money from my parents and so forth.
 I also happened to work, so I had some own money but not enough freedom.
 Once I worked, I felt free because I could choose where I live and eat at the time I
 choose to eat and sleep when I wanted to sleep and so forth and so on.
 The only thing I had to do is work.
 But aside from work, I was entirely free.
 I could choose where to work.
 So I believe, and this is also my observation and if you have parents of children or whatnot,
 I think my observation is that most people are much happier if they are working than
 if they're not working.
 Right, and if they're working, they have a sense of purpose, but also if there's a sense
 in their work that the harder or more efficiently they work, that that has some direct connection
 to their ability to get ahead, right?
 Yes.
 I mean, I'm a Christian and I pray not three times a day but once a day and I'm always
 grateful that at my age I still have a job.
 Okay, it's my job, I don't work for anyone else but I'm happy to do something and I'm
 still studying things because the more you study, the more problems come up and the puzzle
 of life when philosophy and history and geography falls slowly into place but it's never complete
 because there are always new events occurring.
 Right, right.
 All right, well, look, Mark, you're taking this again right where I want to go.
 Real quickly, just to close out the money side and I hate to be this pedestrian but
 as you look at your current outlook for next year and you are looking -- we have a lot
 of people watching this channel who are looking to position themselves intelligently for what
 might lie ahead but I think most of them just don't want to position themselves unintelligently.
 They just don't want to become a casualty of what may happen next year with some of
 the trends we're talking about.
 Are there any particular favored assets or unfavored assets right now that you feel particularly
 strong about?
 I heard you say earlier that you feel like the emerging markets are beginning to look
 like they may offer some values here.
 I'm guessing for your thoughts about what might happen with the currencies and some
 of the central planner responses.
 Maybe the sun is shining a bit brighter for gold and some hard assets but I don't want
 to put words in your mouth.
 What are you looking at right now?
 Yes, I always have a position in precious metals and my preference is to have physical
 metal in your pocket here where you live.
 I know that some people favor bitcoins and cryptocurrencies but we've now seen with the
 aggression in the Gaza Strip that you can switch off the electricity and the communication
 network so try to buy something in a grocery store with bitcoins and the internet doesn't
 work or book a ticket or whatever.
 Number two, where you hold your assets.
 I think this is an important issue whether it's stocks, bonds, commodities or real estate.
 Where the asset is physically located is important and diversification I'm sorry to say would
 involve owning some assets outside of the US Empire and then there are markets that
 go up every year but they're not the same market so at the end of 2021 I recommend it
 on a few occasions to buy Turkey and of course everybody sent me emails and said Turkey is
 very bad because they have high inflation and so forth and so on but the currency had
 collapsed and assets were very cheap.
 The Turkish fund went down to something like 17 and then in 2022 the Turkish fund is ETF
 doubled in value in US dollars and then a year ago what was very cheap were markets
 in the Middle East in particularly in Iraq and this year the Iraq fund of a friend of
 mine is up by more than 90% in the first nine months.
 And that's in US dollar terms.
 Now talking about special situation I think the market of Pakistan is very depressed at
 the present time.
 Now again people will say well Pakistan is horrible and so on and so on but it is bad
 but the market is very cheap and stocks are very cheap so the small investments in the
 Pakistan fund is probably appropriate.
 The other region that if you look at I have some friends they're highly educated and intelligent
 they think we are headed into World War III.
 If World War III is a scenario and I would give it a certain probability not very high
 but a probability in the next 12-18 months then I would say the region that is probably
 the best to invest would be Latin America.
 Because the war theater would be somewhere in the East and South China Sea moving into
 China from the South and moving into China from the North in other words from Alaska
 and then another war zone would probably be in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.
 I'm just guessing, I don't know for sure.
 But Latin America to me would seem to be a bit remote from the war zones.
 And those are resource providing countries and they would probably be providing resources
 to a lot of players in the theater.
 The markets are relatively cheap.
 I lived more than 30 years in Hong Kong after 1973 and then in year 2000 I moved to Thailand
 but I have an office in Hong Kong and I'm a frequent visitor.
 I have never ever seen the mood about Hong Kong and China to be as negative as it is
 right now.
 I think we are in Asia in some markets like Hong Kong and China close to a major low.
 Now can we go down another 10% yes but we can also go up 50% quite easily from here.
 I looked the other day at Hong Kong land, it's a major landlord in the central district
 of Hong Kong but they also have holdings in Vietnam and so forth and so on.
 Hong Kong land sells at 0.22% of net asset value, of book value.
 We can all agree that the property price in Hong Kong will come down by 30% but not by
 80%.
 So I think a lot of Hong Kong property stocks which sell at the 60-70% discount asset value
 are inexpensive but you may have to wait and you may only earn the dividend for the next
 two, three years but I think in my scenario of governments printing money I think inflation
 will come back one day with a vengeance by the way.
 Inflation with a vengeance and most of the things that you listed here should perform
 well if that indeed does happen.
 Couple quick questions.
 Financial assets in inflationary times like in the 70s they don't perform particularly
 well but if we look at precious metals, I like precious metals but I also see that they're
 not as cheap as they were in 1970 because in 1970 the price of gold was no higher than
 in 1935 -- because it had been fixed at $35 -- but also the price of oil was very, very
 cheap in 1970 because the western nations who controlled oil kept it artificially low.
 So Mark, just a couple quick clarifying questions on this.
 So for owning assets ex-US, out of the US sphere of influence, now for precious metals
 that's pretty easy because there are companies that will let you put money in a Brinks vault
 in different countries but for equities, are you saying actually open like a brokerage
 account in a foreign country?
 Yes.
 I think that's a good idea and then also in terms of real estate I would own all the real
 estate in one country.
 I would diversify a bit.
 Absolutely.
 And for the countries that you mentioned, for finding actual funds and opportunities
 to buy in there, are there any resources that you would recommend this audience go check
 out?
 And I don't know, perhaps you talk about specific funds and whatnot in your gloom, doom report
 but are there any resources you could direct folks to for that?
 Well I use research that is published by independent sources and also by banks as a source of information.
 If a bank says buy this or sell that, it doesn't impact my investment decision but I just want
 the information presented by the bank.
 And usually I would say that technical analysis is as valuable as the fundamental analysis
 because the analysts in general are horrible, horrible in their forecasts.
 In the US the quality of analysts is higher but you know you have in each field maybe
 three leading analysts and the rest is not particularly good either.
 I'm going to give you a chance to talk a little bit more about it at the very end but if folks
 read your gloom, doom report, do you mention from time to time, "Hey, this is a fund that's
 got my attention"?
 Yes, of course.
 Yes.
 Okay, great.
 And I'm sorry to be talking so fast.
 I just want to be very respectful of your time and I'm about to hit you with a big question
 here if that's all right now that we've talked about the money stuff.
 I was just at a conference, had the real privilege of moderating a panel that I was actually
 not supposed to moderate.
 The moderator, fellow named Gary Alexander of Navalier Associates was supposed to moderate
 it and he ended up not feeling well so I had to step in at the last minute.
 Great panelist, Matt Taibbi was on there, a few other great minds.
 I kicked off the panel with reading some of Gary's prepared notes and I'd just like to
 read it to you quickly and get your reaction to it.
 Here's what he said.
 He said, "I never thought I would say this but the last two decades since George Bush
 and Karl Rove have made me say that the 20th century looks like responsible government
 spending and control by comparison to the 21st century so far.
 The federal deficit has exploded tenfold since 9/11.
 It looks like Obama bin Laden won on that fateful day.
 He turned us into paranoid terrorist fighters, overseas warmongers, homeland spies of our
 own people, and terminal spendthrifts."
 I'd like to get your reaction to that and if so, what causes in your estimation are
 principally responsible for this?
 Well that's a good question.
 What is responsible for developments in societies, which way they go and so forth?
 In general, I don't believe that the system of democracy, the way we have it, will work.
