I think it's fair to say that this is
which then become subject to unexpected
and prolonged contractions. It was a
prophetic question as the stock market
soon after became caught up in the mania
of the dot-com bubble reaching
unprecedented levels of over valuation
followed by a precipitous price
correction. The Nasdaq didn't return to
its 2000 highs until 15 years later.
Many are feeling like it's deja vu all
over again with the latest run-up in the
stocks colloquially known as the
magnificent seven that are driving the
market indices to new record highs today.
Are we in a new era of irrational
exuberance? This time around driven by
the promise of artificial intelligence?
And if so, what's the danger this time of
another prolonged contraction ensuing?
For perspective, we're fortunate to talk
today with David Hay, chief investment
officer in principle at Evergreen Gavco.
David, thanks so much for joining us
today. Adam, it's a pleasure as always
and before we get into this I just want
to say congratulations on thoughtful
money. It is really taking off and
just kudos to you and keep up the great
work. Well, thank you. It's always an
honor to have you on here. You're always
so kind. Thank you for the kind words.
I'm super excited because we just
landed, if you can believe it, David Hay
for an interview, so that one's going to
be fantastic.
Right. Well, hopefully I won't disappoint.
That's a high bar there, Adam. Well, you
won't and you did extra homework in
advance of this conversation, David, and
put together a nice set of slides for us
which we'll get to in just a moment.
But very quickly, if we could, let's just
kick things off with the general
question I'd like to ask you at the
start of these discussions. What's your
current assessment of the global economy
and financial markets?
Boy, you really caught me off guard with
that one, Adam.
I've never seen that one coming, huh?
I'm teasing you because I do listen to
almost all your interviews and
I've heard you ask that and actually
it's great. I love how you cut to the
chase and
to do that, you know, let's just, you know,
talk about what we see coming. Well, first
of all,
observe. I mean, that's the first thing is
observe what's going on right now and I
think it's fair to say that this is
absolutely a speculative blow-off. That's
the easy part.
Now, the hard part is, when's it going to
stop? And, you know, that was a great quote
you
read from Alan Greenspan because I think
he said, he said that in 1996,
and the NASDAQ hit its peak at 5,000
in 2000, in March of 2000, so
almost four years after he said that and
I, you know, I'm not
gonna pretend like I saw the extent of
that bubble because I remember telling
people the NASDAQ was crazy when it hit
2,500
and then it went to that 5,000 and so I
was,
it was really a very painful time of my
career because it was clear that it was
insanity,
but the insanity kept working and you
saw people like
Warren Buffett really struggling and
then amateur investors making a killing
and I think there's some real
similarities today.
Alright, well look, why don't we
dig into that? So,
sounds like you agree that we're
seeing some degree of exuberance here.
I guess we can talk about how
irrational it is.
You know, we've got stocks like,
so we've got a small number of stocks
powering
the general markets higher, the
Magnificent Seven.
You know, we've got some of the worst
market breadth
on record. You know, it's really just a
very small number of stocks driving this
market.
Stocks like Nvidia, which the day we're
talking, Nvidia
had their earnings released the day
before
and I think it was the second largest
market
cap gain in history, day in history.
So,
and you know, Nvidia has been on a tear.
It's trading at
some 35, 40 times
price to sales ratio right now. I mean,
these are just valuation
levels that are just crazy, but
obviously, it's got all the momentum
behind it and there's a lot of people
out there saying, "Well, hey, this time's
different."
You know, the dot-com, there were a ton
of companies that had crazy valuations,
yes, but they didn't have any
earnings. Now we have companies like
Nvidia that have
gargantuan earnings and so maybe
these valuations are justified
this time around.
How different is this time, truly?
Well, let's go back to that 1999 era,
which was interesting. I told you how
painful it was for me, but what really
kind of saved my career was a company
called Qualcomm,
which actually I bought during the Asian
crisis in 1998 and it was
kind of a value stock. I think it was a
little over one-time sales
and it actually, if you go back and look
at Qualcomm in 1999, it puts Nvidia to
shame.
I mean, it was up like 1,500 percent in
1999,
but like Nvidia, it was heavily earnings
driven.
I mean, they did have an absolute earnings
blowout and sales blowout during that
period,
but it got way, way overdone so that when
the tech bubble did finally
burst, Qualcomm got crushed too. And I'd
say that's a bit of a
warning for people that are really
smitten with
Nvidia right now. And you know, what I
think is going to happen at some point, I
have no idea of when
this quarter that I'm going to describe
is going to happen, but at some point
they will post a quarter that might be
very good, but not good enough.
And we haven't gotten to that point yet.
We didn't know, you and I talked to her
the week and you and I both suspected
they were going to have
probably pretty good numbers, but I do
think at some point it's inevitable they
just won't be good enough.
But you've got a visual here on just
AI and kind of AI
Uber Alles, which it is, this is I think
what's different versus what happened
in the tech bubble. There wasn't, you
had the internet, so the internet was
was relatively new back then, whereas AI
is relatively new today.
So in that way there's similarities, but
this AI thing came after the, you would
have thought that the tech bubble had
actually burst back in 2022.
And you could have said, "Well, maybe
that's similar to what happened with the
tech stocks you may remember in the
Asian crisis
in the summer fall of 1998." They got
absolutely new. In fact, it was so
scary that the Fed actually cut interest
rates
before they went back to raising again.
But anyway, there are some parallels. I
mean, I think if you look at one of your
images here that's
on the valuations of IT and
communication stocks, comparing it now
versus then,
it's very similar.
All right, and is that in your slide
presentation? Should I pull it up, David?
Yeah, you've got the AI images,
kind of some cartoons. They're actually
the front page of The Economist,
and I think that should worry people
given the fact that The Economist is so
often wrong-way coring. And usually when
they're highlighting something
in a positive way, you want to go the
other way.
Right, it's sort of a curse of the
Economist cover story, right?
Absolutely. They're one of the worst, but
you know, right now AI has got just
enormous momentum behind it, so it's
probably going to take a while for that
to play out.
But then if we look at the next one, I
mean you really see
this is an amazing parallel with what
happened back then.
Now, I will say that the valuation
of the Magnificent Seven, which now
includes Nvidia as
minus Tesla, you know, it doesn't
look outrageous
given, you know, the rapidly growing
earnings. Nvidia has been the most
expensive, but
earnings revenues have quickly caught up.
I think where you really have the kind
of 2000 type of
overvaluation, that's when the NASDAQ was
trading at around 100 times earnings,
but you get a level below the Magnificent
Seven
to these companies that are highlighted
every week by investors daily with
their leading stocks,
and it's very common to see companies
trading at 70, 80,
100 plus times earnings, if they have any
earnings, or at very high multiples of
sales if they don't.
And to me, that's where you're really
going to get, you know, the bloodbath.
I don't think it's going to be the
Microsofts or Amazons of the world that
go down
a lot, and just look back to 2022, a lot
of these things hit their crescendo
in late 2021, and they went down 80 to 90
percent
in 2022 when the NASDAQ was down 35.
So I think you're going to see a replay
of that kind of a shakeout
with these lower quality companies, many
of whom I've never even heard of, but I'm
in the business.
So that's, you know, I think that's a
little bit different twist on perhaps
where the really extreme
speculation is right now, but I think the
facts bear it out pretty well.
You've got some other good visuals here
that kind of get to the point of,
are there some replays of what happened
back then? You've got the semiconductors,
as you were saying,
the multiples of sales overall are
getting pretty up there,
and as you're aware, you get up to 10
times sales, and that's generally
considered to be bubble
territory, and we're obviously
pushing that, and that's including some,
you know, relatively pedantic
semiconductor companies in there, not
just Nvidia.
If we get to the next one, you know, people, I
think, look at last year and go, gosh, how
come I didn't make more money? Well, this
this visual, I think, would tell you why,
and that's also very similar to what
happened back in that 1998 to 2000 period.
In fact, most stocks went into a bear
market in the spring of 1998
and stayed that way until the tech
bubble burst, and when the tech bubble
did burst back then,
it was the value stocks that actually
then performed quite well
during that bear market, which actually
took the Nasdaq down almost 80 percent,
and the S&P went down roughly 50 percent,
so it's it's not a bad idea at this
stage to be looking at
companies that aren't quite so inflated
in value,
and we're going to go over some names at
the end that actually also have momentum,
and that's kind of the best of both
worlds.
The only thing we could look at is just
is kind of another way of seeing this
narrowness, this market halitosis,
bad breath that you were talking about
earlier, when you look
at the equally weighted, so this just
takes the S&P 500, every company
one percent, as opposed to, as we know, a
very cap-weighted
market. In fact, a pretty amazing
statistic, this is the Nasdaq, but in the
Nasdaq,
10 stocks make up half of the Nasdaq's
value. It's just,
you know, really quite stunning.
David, starting to wrap it up, on that
point, you talked about how
a lot of smaller stocks sort of
recrashed
going into the dot-com bubble burst.
Absolutely. And then we had,
you know, these dramatic 50 to 80 percent
corrections in the major indices.
Given that we have even more
concentration
this time around, do you see that we
could potentially have
that big of a decline, or perhaps even
greater, given that so much market cap is
in so few stocks now?
Well, I mean, I think it's going to be
painful, but I don't think it's going to
be an 80%
Nasdaq wipeout replay, for the reasons we
talked about. I mean,
you know, Microsoft trading at 30-plus
times earnings, maybe it corrects to 25
times, but
it's these other companies that have
much weaker franchises, and in many cases
much higher valuations,
that I think are going to be where the
real carnage is.
Got it. All right, so those will be, you
know, maybe in the 80 percent
range, but because they're
such a smaller percentage of the overall
indices, they're not going to pull the
indices down as much.
I think that's fair. I just don't see any
80 percent Nasdaq decline coming up.
Okay. That doesn't mean it couldn't be 40
or 50, which would
not be a lot of fun, and it should catch
a lot of people off guard, but
you know, maybe that's because we, you
know, as I was saying earlier, we
are seeing tremendous acceleration,
tremendous momentum, and breakouts.
So that is an important point to make, is
that we are breaking out to new highs
in the S&P and the Nasdaq 100.
The Nasdaq itself hasn't broken out yet,
but it may, and I'm, as you know, a huge
fan of breakouts. We're going to talk
about some that
are doing the same thing, but with, in
most cases, very reasonable valuations,
and
to me, that's the way to play this
market in a late stage phase,
is with companies that have, you know,
maybe they're trading at 10 times, 11
times earnings, but they're also making
either new multi-year highs or new
all-time highs.
All right, and I'm curious, if you look
at the past year on this chart here,
you know, it's been positive growth
for the general S&P,
you know, pretty much since the very end
of 2022,
but the equal weighted index,
you know, up until kind of near the end
of last year was negative, and it's now
all of a sudden making a run.
Is that, is that like a late
stage sign?
I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to
bias the data here, but, you know,
is it sort of finally, it's catching a
bid, and is that what tends to happen
right at the end, or is that something
that happens elsewhere in the cycle?
Well, it sure didn't happen, as you
mentioned earlier, back in '98 to 2000. I
mean, they just kept, the smaller
companies kept lagging
until the bubble burst, the tech bubble
burst, and then the money went into value.
It's interesting, we did have this
broadening out that you just described
happened last summer, last June,
and that was one way I thought we could
resolve the bad breath that was at that
time,
was to have the broader market kick in,
which it did, but it didn't kick in very
long, and then the tech started to roll
over in July and went through, you know,
relatively,
well, maybe not a serious correction,
but a definite correction
that lasted until late October, and of
course, that's when everything took off,
and
so, yeah, I mean, I guess that's what I
would say, is if you want to bet on this
bull market continuing, I think you'd
want to be betting on it broadening out,
and, you know, that's, there are viable
ways to play that. If you flip to the
next page, the next visual, rather,
you'll see that it's, you know, so far it
isn't happening.
It's, you know, it's just more of the
same, frankly.
Yeah, actually, you're right. I should
have waited to ask my question until I
saw this chart.
Well, but as you can see in that
red line, there is a little bit of a
little bit of a catch up, although the
gap is still huge,
and, you know, this is what I find
really perplexing, is that we're talking
about a market that is so
white hot, at least in, you know, the
leading stocks, and yet
we look at the overall situation, because
I know a lot of times you'd say, well,
what's your assessment of the global
financial markets and the economy?
And the economy is a very different
story than the markets,
and I think you mentioned here in one of
your recent shows that
you've got a technical recession in
Germany, technical recession in the UK,
technical recession
even Japan, and then China's economy is
very recessionary for it.
So it's an odd time, and one of the
things that I think is
has really been a knuckleball, frankly,
for people like me who've been expecting
a recession,
even in the US for a while, is that we
had this
doubling of the federal deficit last
year from a trillion to two trillion.
And I know you've had Kevin Muir on
there, I'm a huge fan of Kevin's, and he's
pointed out, you know,
people missed the fiscal stem, and I
did. I didn't think we were going to
double from a trillion to two trillion
last year.
It's inconceivable,
this is a great word from Princess Bride,
that that's happening at a time when the
economy is healthy.
Very hard to have a recession when you
have two trillion dollar deficits.
Budget office is saying as they come
down to 1.6 trillion. I
question that, frankly, and if you look at
the way
this fiscal year is trending, it's
actually trending for even a greater
deficit.
So once again, it's going to be tough to
get a recession in the U.S., I believe,
but it's also, you know, what I'd call
pseudo-prosperity.
And I'm the first to admit that
pseudo-prosperity is still prosperity,
but this isn't healthy. It's just, you
know, Charles Gove, and I want to give
credit to my partner firm at GoveCal
because they provided
these slides, but Charles wrote a very
good piece recently where he pointed out,
if you're buying stocks in a country
where the economy is being juiced as
much as it is by
unsustainable deficits, does that really
deserve a high multiple or does that
deserve a lower multiple? And if you go
to the next visual, you'll see some of
the stuff that we're talking about
where it's, you know, you could really
make, oh,
I apologize, because that this is an
important point to make
versus the 1990s, and this is actually
kind of a bullish
take on it, which is that back then IPOs
were going nuts.
It actually kind of went nuts in the
mid part of that decade,
but we're still running at a very high
level in 2000,
whereas today, you know, they had their
big surge back to 2021. Didn't get up as
high as they did in the late 90s, but
they're at a very low level, and the
reason this matters is this is supply,
right?
So if IPOs are at a low level, then
there's not a lot of supply. Now there's
some signs that's starting to change, but
you know, I gotta say you probably would
chalk this one up to the bulls,
but again, back to this theme of not, so
if we go to the next one,
this is not very bullish. I think this is
actually quite ominous long term.
It's just how much capital the government
is sucking in,
and you know, what that's doing to the
private sector. I think you could very
well make the case
that the private sector is in recession
right now, and you know, not by every part
of it, of course, but
some major segments are very
recessionary.
If we look at the next one, we're going
to get up to a Lacy Hunt one coming up
here in a bit, but
this is the idea that
the, you know, just the contrast between
the, and that this is probably the reshoring,
this is probably the CHIPS Act and all
this, where we're really trying to
bring the industrial base back in the
United States and to do it in a very,
very short period of time,
but you do worry about misallocation of
capital, but really the next one is kind
of the
the key, which is this idea that as the
government spends
at a higher and higher rate, what it does
is it hurts productivity.
And while you, so this, I think this is a
critical point, because I think Lacy Hunt
is dead on about this,
that while all this spending is kind of
like crystal meth,
you know, like the Nazis were taking
crystal meth during the early
days of the blitzkrieg, and
you know, the enemies thought they were
superhuman, but of course that wore off,
and then they crashed and were pretty
worthless, and that's the problem with
this heavy
degree of fiscal stimulus, is it does
create the sugar high or
caffeine rush or whatever you want to
say it, and then say about it, but then
you go the other way, and it actually
hurts. And just look at how much the
government has spent
since 2000, how high our deficits have
been, how much debt we've taken on,
and yet our growth rates have been
consistently disappointing.
And I think that's going to be the real
shock to the bulls over the next couple
of years. I think you even had a guest on
recently was talking about this, that
we're going to be hitting this phase
where the drag from excessive government
spending starts to kick in.
So I think that's something, you know,
raging bulls should really be aware of.
All right, well people have heard me beat
the lag effect from
so much, both in terms of
just the deflationary forces of all
the rate hikes and stuff that we've done,
but then also to your point,
the negative multiplier that
government spending is creating on
the economy.
And you know, the big question that you've
already raised is just, okay, well
how long is it going to take, right?
Yeah, and a factoid that I really don't
hear brought up, and I think is
absolutely sobering in this regard, is
if you compare federal deficits to S&P
500 total earnings,
they're about the same. And that to me
is absolutely staggering. One thing I did
get right last year was I did say there
was going to be a profits recession,
which there was. It was a pretty mild one,
but
as you know, when the government runs
big deficits, that's like rocket fuel for
corporate earnings.
The fact that there was even a mild
earnings recession with a two trillion
dollar deficit is absolutely astounding,
and I think should get a lot more
criticism than it gets,
or derating them from PE models. Let me
ask you this question, which I've asked
a few people recently, David, just to
get your
general thoughts on it.
We really crossed a Rubicon
when COVID hit in terms of
what intervention the government was
willing to do, right? The scale of the
intervention that the government was
willing to do.
I don't think anybody, if you'd asked
them in 2019,
could have imagined how many trillions
in both monetary and fiscal stimulus
were released in the next two years.
I think people wouldn't have believed it
if you had told them, right?
Sure. We are now,
you know, we're through the pandemic.
Economy is back in action.
We're now being told that
everything's great. Goldilocks, right? That
we've got four plus percent GDP growth
and unemployment still remains down near
record lows and inflation's
coming under control,
right? Yet to your point, we are
deficit spending
at a percentage of GDP that we've
rarely, if ever, done. When we've
done it, it's been during a full-blown
war time, like a world war.
The extreme has now kind of become
business as usual.
And so my question is,
what's the probability
that we'll dial it back down? Because I
have a really hard time
seeing the, picturing the politician who
stands up and says,
"You know what? We've overdone it a bit.
Now it's time to rein in the purse
strings, tighten our belts.
We're going to have to embrace
a little austerity at this point in time."
Even forgetting that it's
an election year where I think the odds
of that are even lower.
I just don't see the political
stomach for dialing it off of
11 now that we've dialed it all the way
up to that.
Well, you're exactly right. And if you
look at the leading
two presidential candidates, neither
one of them has shown any
inclination to try to be fiscally
sound.
So I think you're exactly right. However,
that does lead to a very good point, is
what is going to
cut the Achilles
cord on this thing? And I think it's
going to be the bond market.
And I think it's important in any
discussion like this to talk about
bonds. You know, there's so much focus on
stocks.
But, I mean, how does the government
finance itself? I mean, for a while it was
the Fed, and the Fed's what I call the
magical money machine, the various QEs,
but
right now the Fed is still doing QT,
quantitative tightening, the opposite of
QE.
So where is the government going to get
the money that they need? Because
as you're aware, I mean, it's not just
the two trillion for the new deficits,
it's also the rollover. There's going to
be about nine trillion
of rollover over the next 12 months. So a
eleven, eleven and a half trillion dollars
needs to be raised.
And the bond market is showing signs of
not being,
you know, enamored with the fiscal
situation. And I think that's
particularly true overseas.
And we are seeing some of these central
banks from foreign countries that were
big buyers of treasuries that are now
big sellers.
And we know the banks are sellers. They're,
you know, they're under stress. And of
course the Fed, as I said, is selling.
So you got a lot of sellers with not
that many buyers, especially at the long
end. Short end, there's plenty of buyers.
But if there is a buyer's strike with
longer maturity
treasuries, and the treasury yields spike
like they did in the third quarter,
you know, that will really come as a
shock to the bulls. And one of my
10 surprises for this year was that we
would have inflation start to pop up,
and we would have interest rates rise,
which so far that's one of my better
calls. And we can talk about gold miners
as one of my worst calls, but maybe we'll
get to that later.
But yeah, I think it's going to be the
bond market that calls,
you know, calls game over here for this
absolutely out of control federal
spending, which is creating this illusion
that everything's okay.
Everything is not okay. I mean, you got
half of Americans that are worried about
a civil war.
You know, the other thing that leads
me to is I've been interested in how many
of your guests,
really, really bright people, and some who
are bullish, who say
we're in the fourth turning. Neil Howe's
belief that we're in
the fourth mega crisis, or the fourth,
the first mega crisis since World War II,
the fourth one, I think, in the history
of the United States.
And I think that's right, and
how that squares with a raging bull
market,
maybe you could explain that one to me.
Well, I mean, you're putting your finger
on an issue I talk a lot about on this
channel
of late, which is the fact that, you know,
so much of the wealth and the
opportunity is concentrating
in the upper echelons of society into
fewer and fewer pockets.
And, you know, that cohort still spends a
lot, you know.
You know, I think we're at the point
where people are beginning to wake up to
just how maybe unfair the situation is.
And obviously,
it takes a while before people get
really shaken
out of their status quo to be
willing to
put the status quo at risk. And
I think we're in that process, that
in-between process where we're seeing
the bottom 80%, maybe bottom 90%,
they're trying to continue as they have
been.
And, you know, we're seeing
revolving credit skyrocket, right? We're
now seeing defaults begin to kick up in
auto loans and credit card debts.
Not yet housing so much, but that
could be coming soon.
So, you know, when it starts getting
to a high enough pain threshold,
you know, then I think maybe the
majority of the public starts considering
alternative action. But right now,
I think everyone's just
so focused on trying to get through the
day that they're not yet
ready to reach over for the pitchfork.
But who knows how much longer
that might be.
Well, I think you're right. I think
that's very true. And it's,
you know, it's kind of like the stock
market. We talked about how narrow the
stock market is. Well, that's
really true of our natural wealth. It's
become very narrow. It's,
you know, things are healthier when
they're broad. And right now, they're not
very broad.
Well, they're not. Sorry, go ahead.
Well, I was gonna say, if you just go to
the next visual, this is actually another
interesting way to look at it.
This is really looking at how dominant,
unbelievably dominant, the U.S. is in
terms of the world's market cap.
70 percent. And if you go back and you
look at that 2000 period, it was way, way,
way below that.
And what's interesting is U.S. percentage
of GDP
is actually down. And so if you look at
U.S. GDP relative to global GDP,
it's, you know, it's off the lows, but
it's way below where it was,
you know, roughly 20 years ago. That's not
healthy. That's not sustainable.
So is that generally a sign of
like multiple expansion here, which is
that we're just, we're valuing
our national income at a higher
rate than we were before?
A lot of it. I think you, to be fair, you
have to say that
U.S. profit margins have been exceptional
compared to the rest of the world.
And a lot of that is due to the
magnificent seven. So it's,
you know, it's to be fair, there has been,
you know, some fundamental drivers to it
as well.
The question is whether they're now being
over discounted. I would tend to lean
that way.
All right. Well, look back to kind of
what could end this party.
And if you've got more charts you want
to go through first, feel free to
push this question off. But you
you said that the bond market really
could be the thing that
that, you know, would represent the cops
showing up at the party, right?
And we did see a bear steepening
in the yield curve, what, Q3 of last year
for a period of time. And we had, you
know, for a little while there there was
a lot of discussion on,
you know, how that was taking folks by
surprise and what that implication could
be going forward.
Rates then came, or yields then came down
heading into the year. But they're
creeping back up again here. We're at
what, like 4.3 on the the 10-year right
now?
Yeah, it's up 50 basis points from below
in December. That's a lot.
Okay, so you talked
about one of your predictions for the
year is that the bond market could
surprise people by
continuing to steepen from here, start
trying to take the punch bowl away.
How much of that is connected to
inflation expectations versus just
the bond market just beginning to say,
"Look, I'm getting real worried about
all this
this, you know, oversupply of government
debt and the fact that nobody wants to
buy it."
Well, I think it's both. If we go to the
next visual, you'll see what's been going
on here with inflation.
And this is the, you know, the thing
that's been a raging debate and a lot of
your people have talked about it, which
is,
you know, getting inflation down from say
9% to 4%
is relatively easy, especially when, you
know, the supply chain opens up and
you've got
a bear market at commodity prices. So a
lot of this disinflation has happened
with goods.
But now what we're starting to run into
is the services part,
which is a lot stickier. Now, I know that
there are, you know, the bulls on low
inflation,
and I have to similar my good friends
would say, "Yeah, but now you're going to
have rents
really kicking in and coming down." And I
think there's validity to that for sure,
because it's a very big part of the CPI.
But some of these services numbers
lately have been really shocking. And one
that the Fed looks at
is the core services ex-housing.
And that was running at 10% annualized
here recently.
And if you look at the services prices,
PMI prices paid,
it jumped from 57 to 66, roughly,
most recent month. That was a big, big
number. So we're starting to hear
more and more people say, "Look, the
problem is going to be inflation coming
back
up because we've got kind of this
embedded inflationary
forcing." That's a lot of it's coming from
these wage contracts, many of which are
signed for multi-years.
And it, you know, people say, "Well, that's
just a union, is it?" But no, it's a
competitive marketplace out there still.
You know, there are signs the jobs market
is weak and have sympathetic to that.
But I do think you continue. I mean, this
is an amazing factor.
I haven't shared it with you before. The
average UPS driver today makes
$170,000 a year, including benefits.
We're hearing people that work in
hotels in New York at, you know, low
levels making $100,000 a year.
The Wall Street Journal just had a great
article about how high food prices still
are. So
you've got this situation where maybe
the increase isn't, you know, it's
definitely leveling off, but it's still
at a very high level.
And if it starts to turn back up, which
I think we're seeing signs from these
visuals here that that's occurring,
that's going to be, you know, a major
issue for the bond market.
Great point. Let me ask you maybe
an impolitic question here, but,
you know, in goods inflation,
you know,
you know, prices that have spiked due to
shortages of supply or, you know, input
cost inflation or whatever,
those can come down, right?
Because producers basically say, oh, you
know, like there's a lot of margin
to be made in this part of the
business now. And so, you know, eggs are
selling for, you know, whatever, ten bucks
a dozen, you know, everyone's going to
make eggs, right? And then you get an
oversupply, prices come down. They tend
to sort of self-correct. That's the
cure for high prices, this high prices
theory, right? With
wage-based inflation, it's not so much
like that. It's once you've increased
somebody's wages, it's very hard to
decrease them, especially if it's a
salaried employee.
Obviously, if minimum wage laws are
changes to boost minimum wages, like out
here in California, you know, we've got a
new minimum wage for fast food workers
that's kicking in, that's all of a
sudden now paying them 20 bucks an hour,
right? It would be very hard for that to
all of a sudden just say, "Ah, you know
what, we're going to go back to 16
dollars an hour," right? So that's why the
services side tends to be an awful lot
more sticky. And is it fair to say
that the only real way to provide
relief in terms of
reduced prices on the services side is
pretty much a recession. A recession has
to come in and, you know, basically
decimate a lot of demand and jobs so
that workers are all of a sudden
in a different mindset where they're
like, "Well, look, you know, a reduced wage
is better than no wage."
Yes, yes, I think that's the conundrum
that at some point the Fed is going to
have to face because you're exactly
right. It's a lot easier to get goods
inflation down, you know, or have
disinflation, even deflation. We've had a
tremendous amount of that
over the whole last, I mean, really since
the invasion of Ukraine,
ironically, that was pretty much the peak
in almost all commodity prices.
Uranium is a notable exception. But
then once you get these wages
in place, these wage increases in place,
those are really sticky.
And the services element of
the economy component is about 70 percent.
So what's happening there is really
critical.
And so now what if we start to see
commodity prices
rise again? And I would say, particularly,
and I know we're going to talk about
this in a bit,
the most important energy commodity out
there, or the most important commodity
energy in that would be oil.
And that's where I think you're going to
see some problems
arise your term. So
yes, you're exactly right. Now what's
happening in the labor market is that
because it was so difficult to hire
employees there for, you know, during the
COVID period and post-COVID period, so
employers are very clearly reluctant to
to fire people. But what they're doing is
reducing hours. So
hours worked, and I'm sure you've seen
some of these charts are coming down at
a rate reminiscent of right before the
Great Recession.
So first you see hours cut, then you see
people cut.
And that's why I'm not as sanguine about,
you know, the soft landing as a lot of
other folks are.
So very good point, Adam. And on the
people cut side of things,
my read of historic data is that
when companies make the shift from,
"All right, I got to try to keep my
employees for as long as I can," to,
"You know what? I'm not going to make it. I
got to start, you know, cutting costs just
to survive going forward,"
it's sort of like a watershed event. Like
the unemployment rate, when it
does start moving up, it tends to move up
quite fast heading into a recession. Like
it's not like a slow
build. It tends to be like a, you know,
it's basically a change in sentiment
on the employer that just said, "I'm
shifting from hoard mode
to purge mode." And so,
you know, just be careful because if we
do cross into that,
if we do cross that line of transition,
you know, the situation could change
pretty quickly.
And that's really been the historical
precedent. I think this time it's being
pushed out of it, just from what we
talked about, that there was such a
shortage of workers for so long,
that's still in the memory of business
owners. So I think they will try to avoid
that, but
you are seeing, in a very dramatic
fashion, a drop-off in full-time
employment. So if you look at the last
three months,
full-time jobs are down by 1.4 million,
part-time jobs are going up.
And there's some kind of weird things
about the way that gets reported with
the non-farm payrolls,
counting even part-time jobs is multiple
jobs. So if somebody's working
three part-time jobs, they consider that
three jobs.
And there's also, I heard a great
podcast here the other day where
the point is that where you're seeing
some growth in employment is at
very small enterprises,
which tend to pay less than at the
big companies. I mean, it's just a
proliferation of layoff announcements
from these
big blue chip companies. I mean, layoffs
are really starting to spike up there,
which
would seem to indicate, to your
point, that maybe we're at that
juncture
where we are going to start to see the
official unemployment numbers look
worse. It's been surprisingly strong,
but
they're very subject to
downward revision, in my opinion.
Yeah, and I've talked a lot on this
channel about the high degree of
suspect of
the BLS jobs numbers. It seems that
every time they test your tolerance
for credibility,
the next report is even more
extreme. Even to the point now where a
lot of mainstream people, I see that the
last payroll report came out,
I saw a lot of general mainstream
cheerleaders say, "Man, I just don't think
I believe these numbers."
Now, that being said, I'm not trying to
say we're at that precipice yet, although
I agree with everything you said, David,
that we're seeing
a resurgence in layoffs, and we're
seeing
hours getting cut, and all the
preliminary signs you would expect to
see. But
I just wanted to underscore that
we tend to fall into an unemployment
problem very quickly, and it
tends to take everybody by surprise
with how swiftly it happens.
Yes, I think it's
been largely pushed off
for all the reasons we talked about, the
extreme amount of labor hoarding that's
gone on this time in the cycle,
the companies that are just hoping
the Fed's going to ride to the rescue
with rate cuts
to save them from the
upcoming maturity wall and all that
stuff.
But if we do get to a point where
the corporate fleet finally just says,
"You know what? The cavalry is not coming
in time. I've got to start letting these
people go."
That's something that could drop us
into recession much faster than the
market is currently expecting.
Not predicting it's going to happen this
year, but I could certainly make a good
argument for it, and I just want to make
sure that people are keeping an eye open
to that possibility.
And I've certainly been very attuned to
that and very sympathetic to that
viewpoint, but I do think we have to
concede that it's tough to get
really a true recession when you've got
this kind of fiscal stem still going on.
That's why I would come back to the bond
market. As long as the bond market
is fairly calm, then I think this can
continue.
And the other thing that, again, to give
a bullish
piece of very important data is what's
happened with credit spreads.
And I think credit spreads are just as
important as interest rates. As you know,
that's the difference between what
corporations pay to borrow money
and what the government pays. And that
was one of the big problems with 2022,
is credit spreads. As rates were going up,
credit spreads blew out, and junk spreads
got up to 600 basis points, 6%
over treasuries. Now they've come back
down to about 4% over treasuries, even
maybe a little below that.
And so you've got fairly tight credit
spreads and really
very little sign that they're widening.
And that
that actually happened coming out of
October, where you had the big decline
in rates, so the 10-year treasury went
from over 5 to 380,
and at the same time credit spreads came
down about 100 basis points.
And that was just, you know, light of fire
under stocks and bonds.
But if those spreads start to widen now,
I would be
much more concerned than I am right now.
And what could be a little bit of a
carry in the coal mine is what's
happening with triple C spreads. So triple
C is low-rated junk,
truly junk, and those spreads have
widened kind of sharply lately.
So maybe that's a sign that there is
some trouble coming.
And if somebody wanted a great heads-up,
I'd say, you know, follow credit spreads.
They
they are extremely impactful on
financial markets.
I'm maybe jumping the gun here a
little bit, but
do you have any sort of preferred way
for playing a blowout in credit spreads?
Well, I mean, the simple way would be to
sell down,
you know, like your junk bond holdings.
That would be the area that would
get hit the hard top. You're really
aggressive. I guess you could short some
of the junk ETFs out there.
You know, I'm a pretty determined shorter,
believe it or not. I'm one of the few
still alive. I have a long-short
portfolio that I run for myself. I'm not
doing that right now, but
it's sort of tempting. I think where
you're going to see the problems would
be at the lower
rated tranches. So in the junk market, the
triple B
segment, which has actually been a
growing part of it, so that's a good
thing. It's higher quality than it used
to be.
Those guys have very low default rates.
Where the real risk is, is in
those triple C
rated bonds. And there are some
funds out there, some ETFs, that are more
heavily exposed to the lower
levels of the junk market. So those would
be ones I would target negatively if you
wanted to play that game.
But otherwise, I would be taking profits
in some things that have really run up
here because of the decline in rates and
the narrowing of spreads.
But it's pretty mixed. As you
know, I mean, you would think that
utilities would be
behaving well right now, but they're not
behaving well. You would think
REITs would be doing well, but they're
not doing. They've been bouncing a little
bit lately, but
there's a lot of parts of the market
that are in downtrends,
and that is a little bit concerning.
Well, let's talk about one that you
mentioned earlier, which was the
gold mining
sector. Because if you've got concerns
about inflation, obviously the
traditional asset to buy is the hedge is
gold.
Gold is doing okay. It's
hanging out above 2000,
but it's not going gangbusters
by any stretch.
But man, the mining complex has just
been
breaking hearts for, what, the past
year?
Well, I would say it's been breaking
hearts since 2020.
It's been an phenomenal run-up. It's had some
rallies along the way, but the
moonshot was back in 2020 coming out of
COVID.
Frankly, we've never made money so fast
for clients, and we did it with the gold
miners in that period, and fortunately we
did a lot of profit taking.
We should have done even more, but
yeah, it's been amazing. In
fact, a few weeks ago I had a chance to
spend
several hours one-on-one with John
Hathaway, who's,
I don't know if you've ever had John
on here. He'd be a great guest. He's a
brilliant man.
I have. He is. You're nodding, so you know
who he is. He's considered to be
the elder statesman of the gold mining
industry, and I asked him, I said, "John, did
you ever think that you would see
gold at over 2000 ounce and the miners
in the kind of condition that they're in
right now?" He said, "Never. Never thought
that could happen,
and yet it has." So it is a very
bizarre scenario
for sure. Is that just because their
input costs
went up faster than the gold price, or
why are they so unloved right now, do you
think?
Well, I think you get it. They got to
take a lot of blame. They had just not
been very well run.
I mean, this is a point that I made to
him, and he totally agreed, is we went
back to 2012. Gold was
trading at an average price around 1600
an ounce back in 2012,
and these stocks were multiples of where
they are, especially
the junior miners were multiples of
where they are now. The senior
miners,
yeah, in most cases they were two or
three times higher, and
yet with gold at 2000, their profits are
lower today than they were in 2012.
Now you contrast that to the big oil
companies, and oil was, you know, 100, 100
dollars plus
back 2012, 2013, and
the price of oil today is well below
that, under 80 on WTI,
and yet these oil companies' profits are
well above what they were back then. So
the contrast versus the, you know, the top
tier energy companies
and the top tier gold miners is really
stark and
very unflattering for management teams. I
mean, you just had Newmont
cut their dividend yesterday. I mean, come
on, that stock looks
really right on the edge of, you know,
breaking multi-year support.
It's, I don't know, I think they did
bring some of the energy top executives
over and run some of these gold miners,
personally.
But I do think we'll get it. I think, I
think they are realizing they need to
have a new model. I think they are going
to try to emulate what the energy
companies have done, and
it's just like with oil. It's hard to
find new gold resources, and if you look
at gold reserves in the ground, they are
very low,
and they are having cost overruns, and
one of my points is, geez, one of your
biggest costs is
energy, and energy is quite depressed, so
why are you having trouble on the cost
side, which I think, again, comes back to,
are these guys very well run?
So it's, yeah, it's been very, very
frustrating,
but I do think eventually these guys
will, you know, really go into a major
merger and acquisition.
Some of the big guys combine, and they
cut costs like crazy, and
but right now it's tough. It's much
easier, I think, to be an energy bull, and
maybe we'll talk about energy coming up
here soon.
I know you've got some slides on that, so
I do indeed.
Why don't you, why don't you drive from
here? Oh yeah, so we go to the next one
here. It's,
this one is, really gets very little
attention. We're going to see one in a
bit that gets even less attention,
and that's basically looking at
inventories adjusted for
all these SPR strategic petroleum
reserve releases that the Biden
administration has done.
So what you see is when you look at
overall inventories, because,
you know, that includes the SPR
inventories, which it should,
we're actually at a shockingly low level,
and yet you don't hear that in the
popular press.
And as, so I guess there's kind of three
three acronyms I would use to bring up
that I think are behind
a lot of the weakness in oil, which is IEA,
and then SPR that we just talked about,
and then DUCs, which we're going to talk
about in a moment.
But on the first acronym, the IEA, as you
know, that's International Energy Agency,
and it is considered to still be the
authority on the, on the supply-demand
and overall status of the energy,
particularly oil market.
And they have been so wrong for so long,
how anybody listens to them, it's just
beyond me, but they still have,
they have the market's ear.
And yet they, their undercounting of oil
demand goes back decades.
They did a stealth revision back in 2019,
where they revised
up demand figures by 2 billion barrels.
And then they just did the same thing
since 2019, so they've now done another,
you know, kind of like when they do these
jobs numbers revisions, they get very
little press.
They did another revision here of
another billion barrels of increased demand.
So it's just a joke.
And how do they do that?
Well, it's because they don't look at
the developing markets.
They have chronically and massively
underestimated demand for
oil in developing markets.
Because in the developed world,
we see the rich countries,
demand for oil has actually gone down
a little bit over the last 15 years.
But whatever way you want to say it,
these guys have really given a lot of
false signals.
And I think they give this false sense
of the markets in this.
They've also underestimated,
or overestimated supply.
They consistently said there's going to
be more supply
produced than has been happening.
And I do think that the US Shales,
I think, well, I know you had Adam
Rosenzweig on your show here recently
with my friend Duberg, and
he's very much in the mind that the US
Shales are rolling over.
I mean, basically every US shale oil
basin has turned down already,
and it looks like the Permian is going
to flatten out and start to go down here
very soon, probably even this year.
And that's just huge.
As you know, the US Shales have been
responsible for almost all the oil
production growth in the world.
And most of that has come from the
Permian, and that's where let's,
let's take a look at the next visual
we got coming up here.
So I think this is,
this just doesn't get any coverage at all.
So this is looking at
drilled but uncompleted wells.
And so these were at a very high level
back during COVID,
because companies just quit producing
oil. The price of oil went down to almost
nothing. It went negative in the future
markets, the teams in the physical market.
And so there was a high level of DUCs.
So kind of like if you were, you know,
homebuilding industry, this happened
briefly where there were a lot of
uncompleted homes, you know, half done,
let's say. And so once things perked up,
the first thing they did was complete
those homes.
So that's really what's happened with
the oil industry, is they had all these
half completed wells, so they didn't
really have to keep drilling. They could
just finish those uncompleted wells.
And that's what they've done. And
particularly, this is really the
most unusual visual. There are a
few out there that show what's happened
with DUCs
nationally, but this is really focusing
on the Permian. And since the Permian is
the most important
oil basin in the country, maybe the world,
it's a big deal. I mean,
you just can't keep drawing these things
down. So when people say, "Oh my gosh, look,
the drilling rate count is down
40 or 30 percent," which it is,
why are we still producing, you know, close
to records? Well, this is why.
But this is about to run out. And once
again, I think the market is very
unprepared for this.
We have one more that's made.
And so the implication from this is
that you expect at some point,
you know, there's going to be a real
supply issue with oil, and that's going
to send the price of oil higher.
Yeah, absolutely. I think there will be a
supply. And part of it is because demand,
despite all the negativity out there,
just continues to set new records. I mean,
it's probably going to run 100, 405
million barrels
this year. So yeah,
and this is an interesting chart. So
these charts I should give credit to
cornerstone analytics, Mike Rothman, who's
absolutely one of the best, and he has
gone toe-to-toe with the IEA for years,
and he's been right, they've been wrong.
And he's, with this upper image here, he's
doing this adjustment, where if you look
at
drilled wells and these DUCs,
and you see the divergence with
production, you go, "Wow, this, you know,
that's the alligator jaw that's going to
snap shut at some point."
So with as much
bearishness as there is on oil right now,
that's where I think you can get a
really powerful response as some of this
reality starts to kick in.
All right, and so as you said earlier,
most viewers here probably watched the
video that I did,
the debate between Doomburg and
Adam Rosenzweig. Titularly, the debate
was, "Is peak oil a real thing or a myth?"
Doomburg was arguing the
the side that, yeah, it's probably an
overblown concern,
and his general outlook is that,
yes, they're going to be supply
gluts and supply droughts along the way,
and yes, the price will
bounce around, but for the next couple of
decades, he expects
kind of a slow rise up into the right in
terms of U.S. oil production.
Adam Rosenzweig feels differently, and
David, it sounds like you fall more on
Adam's side of the
the debate. Absolutely, and I just don't
hear
too many of the critics of the oil
market, and actually, Doomburg's told me
he's not bearish oil, and
you'd heard him say that it would
surprise him once 150 or 200.
So, you know, be fair to him, but there's
a lot of people that say, "Oh my gosh,
oil prices are going to go lower. They're
really not cheap at this point," and
you know, as Doomburg noted in your
discussion, inflation adjusted oil prices
are extremely low right now.
You know, it was, you know, back in 2006,
2007, it was trading in this range, and
you know, adjustment inflation, it's way,
way down.
So, yeah, I think it's a coiled spring,
and I think at some point it's going to
snap. I also think natural gas is quite
interesting here, because it,
there really is a glut of natural gas.
It's very different than oil,
where there's actually, I would argue,
quite an acute shortage,
but you're starting to see some real
cutbacks in oil,
I'm sorry, natural gas drilling, and
that's a very hated market right now, and
yet, you know, we're going to
increase our exports of LNG by 50 percent
next year. That's not, you know, the Biden
administration's
freezing approvals for new projects, but
just on existing projects, which are
going to happen, that's going to be a
huge increase in demand for U.S. natural
gas, and
part of Doomburg's thesis is you can
convert gas to
other forms of energy, you know, like,
well, compressed natural gas, CNG,
which can be used as a transportation
fuel. It's absolutely right, but if you
start using natural gas for all these
other applications,
I don't think the price is going to stay
down around two, and actually right now
it's below that,
so I think that's a very good contrarian
play currently.
I've got another picture I play for you
coming up here.
Now, this may be the most
extreme opportunity in an equity market
ever. I know there's lots of reasons why,
I mean, when you look at China and all
the stupid policies that they've put in
place
in recent years, but man, it has just been
an absolute devastation over there, and
you've got some
incredible values on some of their best
growth stocks,
and I have to say, we've been out of
China for a couple of years. It broke
below multi-year support
back into early 2022, which for us is a
big red flag, so we did
completely exit, but
we're, you know, it's tempting. That's
just that I'm so uncomfortable with the
regime that I have a hard time
buying in there, but if you look at the
next image and you look at Hong Kong,
Hong Kong market has fallen four
consecutive years,
and that didn't even happen with the
U.S. stock market during the Great
Depression,
and you look at it back to the level that
it was during the Asian crisis and go,
"There might be some opportunities there,"
but
I realize that's a tricky one for U.S.
investors.
Well, your colleague, Louis Gove,
has
a lot of experience investing in China.
Is he
saying, "Hey, this is the time to start
looking to pick up some value here?"
He is indeed. He has more of an
international mandate, less of a U.S.-
based investor base or investor
group. He can do that a little easier
than we can do it, but
yes, he definitely thinks they're
screaming bargains. What's
interesting, hearing some other people
that
that don't have to be, don't really have
an Asian mandate as Louis does,
and they're doing the same thing. So it's,
if that market moves, it could move
dramatically in a very short period of
time, but it is definitely high risk and
would probably be just a nibble, not a
chomp.
And if you're nibbling in it, what would
you be nibbling into? Would you be
nibbling into specific companies or would
you be buying
geographic ETFs or
Chinese index ETFs? I would probably do
individual companies and try to pick
their very best,
and particularly where you don't
necessarily have,
maybe where it's more multinational, so
even if the Chinese economy continues to
struggle, that the business is strong
enough and diverse enough that it can
still do well, but
we're just kind of sniffing
around that right now, so
I don't have any great ideas there. What we
have coming up here
in a moment is more interesting, I think,
for US investors, and it gets back to
what I've talked about with breakouts,
because again, we look at breakouts and
breakdowns, and the breakdowns are those
that have,
as Paul Tudor Jones calls them, range
expansions that are on the downside.
So if you see a stock or stock market
that's been trading,
you know, for several years within a
tight trading range, and it breaks that
to the downside, which is what happened
with China back in 2022. You better get
out.
They almost always get pounded after
that, and conversely, if you see something
that breaks above
a multi-year trading range, and
particularly if it's an all-time high,
you really get interested. There's a
number of those that are happening in the
US. We've got an image coming up here of
one of them,
T-Mobile, and I'm not telling people to
buy T-Mobile.
It's a little bit extended right now, but
that is a pretty impressive breakout,
and one of the things that I like to see
about stock price breakouts is that they
coincide with earnings breakouts.
So in other words, it's an earnings-driven
breakout, and Nvidia is like the ultimate
example of that.
It was one of the few early tech stocks
to actually make a higher high than it
had been in 2021,
and that was a pretty darn good, you know,
buy signal,
and there's a number of companies that
are doing that today
in the US market that have charts very
similar to T-Mobile.
And just, and I'm not, again, not saying
people should buy these. They should do
their own research, and these are just
kind of a watch list, shopping list,
but Chubb, I think there's a very
interesting story with insurance
companies
currently. AIG, Snap-on Tools,
PBF, which is a big, refined, really
interesting story there.
Diamondback Energy, amazingly, and the
Energy Patch, a company that's making a
new all-time high. Berkshire,
Warren Buffett's company making a new
all-time high. Shell Oil, another,
you know, pretty remarkable achievement
in the energy area. JP Morgan,
I call it, kind of jokingly, Jamie Morgan,
Jamie Cavanaugh's bank. Siemens, Microsoft,
I think you got to say Microsoft's chart
pattern is pretty impressive, and
again, a lot of that's been race driven.
It's the most expensive name of
the ones I just mentioned, but
it's got momentum and, you know, at least
a, you know, decent valuation considering
what's going on with their AI exposure.
So anyway, that's a few things for people
to take a look at.
All right, well look, so you are a
capital manager.
You manage client capital, so you can't
just have an opinion. You actually have
to put it into
into action, and you've got the
responsibility of safely
stewarding your client's assets. So,
you know, you've got some concerns about
where the economy could head, where
markets could head, but we don't
have the luxury of trading or investing
in the markets we wish we had. We have to
invest in the markets as they are
right now. So are you putting capital
into companies like the ones you just
mentioned there? You know, are you
using some of that momentum, but trying
to find companies that have
valuations that are defensible right now?
Yes, we are. Now I'd say we're kind of
maintaining our cash level where they
are, where it is, which is relatively high.
So we still like the T Bill and Chill
idea.
Just, you know, it's a crazy
world out there, and who knows.
I love it. I hadn't heard that before. I'm
going to steal that. Really? No, that's,
I wish I could take credit for that, but
I stole that from somebody else. But
yeah, so the idea is that right
currently what we're trying to do is
we've got a lot of stocks, fortunately,
that have really had big runs. So we're
taking some profits.
Typically we just trim. We don't very
often get out all
together. But where we are
getting out altogether are some
companies that are breaking down, where
they are breaking to new lows,
and recycling that into companies that
have got, you know, attractive valuations.
A lot of those companies I just rattled
off are, you know, kind of trading in the
10 to 15 times earnings range,
amazingly. And so recycling that, you know,
the area that
we really have done the best for our
clients over the years
has been with income investments, bonds,
and other high-yielding securities like
the pipelines.
Oh, you know, somebody referred to me
recently, "Oh yeah, you're the MLP guy!"
And we have liked MLPs for a long
time, and
people still kind of think they're in
the doghouse, and yet they just made a
new
multi-year high, and have been, I mean,
they were up 25 percent last year. Hardly
anybody knows that total return.
So yeah, that is our area of strength.
That's where we've had really
fine return numbers, and so thank you for
bringing that up.
No, well let's talk a little bit about
that, about your offerings there. So
this week I
interviewed and released the interview
with Stephen Bavaria,
who wrote the book The Income Factory,
and basically the
discussion is basically just a deep dive
into how to set up an income-producing
portfolio, hopefully with lower risk.
And I reached out to him because
just one of the top questions I keep
getting
asked for by this audience, which is,
"Hey, can you do
an interview or several videos on income
investing?"
And the feedback to the interview with
Stephen has been very, very high.
A lot of people saying, "Yes, this is the
practical type of guidance I've
really been looking for."
And I think there's a strong
interest in income for
a bunch of reasons. One, I think a
lot of viewers here are
skeptical of how stretched equity
valuations are getting right now,
but a lot of them as well,
we're in an era where you can actually
get pretty good yields now on a lot of
credit that
were harder to get during a zerp era.
But also for
a good chunk of my audience, two-thirds
of it is 45 years and older.
These are people who have wealth.
Their number one mandate is to not lose
the wealth that they have and to try to
live and hopefully retire off of it, and
that's why income is so important.
And for a lot of those people,
they don't have a ton of experience
dealing with a lot of
fixed income instruments.
And so they're really looking for
solutions where they can have a
quarterback kind of run it for them.
So I think folks would be interested in
what you guys do there. So I know you
sent me over some
a couple just quick slides about your
different strategies there. Should I pull
those up now or later?
Yeah, go ahead. So this is income
replacement where our main mandate is to
create via return. We don't worry as much
about volatility, and it has had a much
better performance record than
the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, but
with more volatility, to be fair.
Now the next one that you get is, well,
that there will be a principal
preservation,
which is all bonds, so it doesn't have
MLPs or pipelines or
you know, high equity, high income
equities, it has just bonds.
The current yield on that's about six
percent, and so if somebody's looking to
get a six percent, maybe a little bit
below that right now just because the
decline in rates we've had recently,
but it's a very attractive place
to be if you're,
you know, you want that cash flow but you
want to have downside protection.
Now in fairness, what's happened since
October, because as I mentioned it wasn't
just stocks that have moved,
corporate bonds have had a tremendous
appreciation. We've got a number that are
up, you know, 20 percent
from where they were in October on a
total return basis, almost equity-like
returns, and
that is one thing about the bond market
is if you pick your spots pretty well,
you can get equity-like returns.
Now I would say this is not one of those
times. We've had that big
appreciation. Credit spreads, as I said
earlier, have come down. They're kind of
tight.
So I think this is a time to be, you
know, relatively defensive.
But, you know, if you get, if you buy a
bond that's due in a few years and you're
going to get a five and a half or six
percent yield, even if it goes down a
little bit temporarily, you're not going
to be too upset.
I think where you really have to be
careful in the bond market is with
really long maturities.
If I'm right about my bond market riot
thesis coming up.
And also, Adam, I would say you're
exactly right. It's people can, you know,
pick stocks and
unfortunately tend to pick pretty much
the same stocks.
You know, individual investors'
portfolios are very concentrated as
we've been discussing,
much like the market. But it's tough to
manage money and bonds.
It's really a challenge to even find
them. I mean,
you know, we provide our newsletter, we
provide names of bonds that you might
want to check out,
but it's hard for people to find those.
So I think when it comes to
professional money management, it's even
more critical
in the bond and yield instrument area
than it is in the equity market.
Thanks. And that's echoing something that
Stephen was saying, which is,
you know, in building his own
income factory, he doesn't go to look for
buying individual instruments himself. He
goes and basically tries to
buy fund managers and he's basically
like, look, you know, I work with the
biggest guys,
with the guys that have the greatest
advantage to find, you know, they've got
the smartest
analytical teams and sometimes
can structure deals that a small
fry can't put together.
So, you know, reiterated your point, which
is,
you know, you really don't
want to kind of go this alone
as an inexperienced investor. You want to
leverage the expertise of somebody who's
got a really good track record in
investing in this space.
Please send them our way.
Well, all right, so let's talk
about that. So we're
here at the end of the hour. David, as
always, you just leave it completely on
the field. Thank you so much for giving
such a great
dive into all the things that you're
looking at right now and the decisions
that you guys are making as capital
managers.
For folks that are interested in
learning more about you, following you
in your work after this interview,
where should they go? And in your answer,
for folks that have maybe looked at those
those fixed income strategies and saying,
"Hey, that's kind of interesting. I'd like
to learn more about that."
Tell them where they can go for that as
well.
Well, it's a great point because I've
actually, as you know, wear two hats. So
one of them is as Co-Chief Investment
Officer of Evergreen Gavcal. So that's
our partner for me
in Gavcal research. And they can go right
to our website, Evergreen Gavcal website,
and they can find all kinds of
information on our various strategies.
They can certainly email me. And
this is where I'm going to talk about my
other hat, which is
David Hay, the Haymaker. Haymaker_substack
is where you can find that.
And you can easily contact us there.
So it's, you know, it's a little bit of
unusual setup. But I do think that one of
the advantages I have as a newsletter
writer is the fact that, as you said,
for many, many years, many decades, I've
actually been managing money.
And a lot of my newsletter writing peers
don't do that.
And unfortunately, there's some
restrictions that come with that. I'd be
very careful about what I
recommend. And that's why I try to avoid
direct recommendations as opposed to just
kind of pointing out things that look
interesting. But thank you for that lead
in and thank you for all your great
questions. It's always such a
pleasure to talk with you, Adam.
Oh, thank you, my friend. It's a privilege
on my end as well, and on the audiences,
to get to hear from you. So just to make
sure folks completely understand. So, you
know, David writes his Haymaker newsletter
over at Substack. And David, when I edit
this, I'll put up the links to both
websites on the screen so folks know
exactly what he's talking about.
Thank you.
But I'm a subscriber to it. It's a
wonderful publication. And so if you
want to stay up to date with where David
sees the puck heading, you go to
Substack, you sign up for that.
If you're interested in perhaps having
some of your capital managed by David's
firm, and specifically, you know, if
you're particularly interested in those
fixed income strategies, that's where you
go to evergreengavcall.com and end up
talking to somebody there with your
questions, correct?
Right.
All right. All right, David. Well, look,
I've got one last question for you, and
I'm going to give you about 30 seconds
to think about it. And that's that we've
been talking all about money and finance
so far in this conversation, a little
bit about energy. But I'm very curious.
I've been asking this question to other
recent guests. You know, you're a worldly
man, successful gentleman. What's one
non-money related investment that you
would encourage folks to consider
adopting in your life? And while you chew
on that, I'm just going to do a quick
little series of housekeeping. One, if
you've enjoyed having David on this
program, I'd like to have him come back
anytime he sees something material on
his dashboard there that he'd like to
share with us. Please let him know that
by hitting the like button and then
clicking on the red subscribe button
below, as well as that little bell icon
right next to it. And a reminder that the
Thoughtful Money Spring Conference is
coming up fast now, and you only have a
couple days left to lock in the lowest
early bird discount price for that
conference. The conference itself takes
place on Saturday, March 16th. If you
can't actually watch live that day, don't
worry about it because we'll send replay
videos of the entire event, including
both the presentations and the live Q&As
to everybody who registers within 24
hours of the event. But if you want a lot,
if you act quickly, you can, like I
said, lock in that lowest early bird price
discount. And if you're a premium
subscriber to our sub stack, you get an
additional $50 off of that price. So to
go lock that in, just go to our sub stack,
put a URL to it right here. And again, I
think it only costs $15 a month to
subscribe. Happy if you spend 15 bucks
just to save the 50 and pocket the $35
yourself. I just want you to get the
lowest price. And then just as I do every
week, I highly encourage everybody who's,
the vast majority of people who are
watching, to navigate this uncertain road
ahead following the guidance of a good
professional financial advisor who
understands all of the risks that David
talked about here. If you're interested
in talking to David and his firm, go
to evergreengolfcall.com. And if
you've got a good one who's already doing
this for yourself, great, stick with them.
If they're doing a good job, they're
really worth their weight in gold. But if
you think you'd be helped by it, consider
scheduling a free consultation with one
of the financial advisors that Thoughtful
Money endorses to do that. Just go to
ThoughtfulMoney.com. These are the same
financial advisors you see with me on
this channel week after week. Lance
Roberts and his team at Real Investment
Advice, the guys from New Harbor, and the
guys from Rocklink Financial from
Canada. And just a reminder, these
free consultations don't cost you any
money. There's no commitment to work with
these guys. They just sit down with you,
hear about your personal financial
situation, tell you what they think you
should do. You can go off and do that
yourself. You could give that insight to
your own financial advisor and say, "Hey, I
like these guys' ideas. I want to do this."
Or you can keep talking to the guys if
you want to. It's just a free public
service that they offer. All right, David,
with all that housekeeping out of the
way, what non-money-related investment
would you encourage folks to think about?
Well, you called me worldly, which was
very fine. Really, elderly would be more
appropriate, having been in the business
45 years. But it actually is kind of a
good lead-in to what I was going to say,
which when I think back about my life and
how I had very few advantages when I
started out in the business, I was probably
the least likely to succeed in the
financial industry. In fact, I shouldn't
say this, but it's absolutely true. My
degree was in cinema studies and
filmmaking from the University of
Washington, not even UCLA. So not
exactly the right thing to go into the
financial industry in the late '70s when
I joined. But older people, that's really
the point I was going to make. I have had
so many benefits from older people. And I
would say that our society has become so
youth-oriented, and maybe that's
starting to shift a little bit. But I
would say invest and really treasure the
older people in your lives. Try to learn
from them and just appreciate them.
Great point. And that's something I've
talked a little bit about in this
program, but I'm so glad that you're
adding voice to it now, which is that
culturally, historically in our culture
and certainly in most cultures around
the world, you had the benefit of the
wisdom and the voice of the elders that
would influence the decision-making of
the younger people as they came into
power. It was a generational wisdom that
was passed down generation over
generation to hopefully help the culture
make better and better decisions as time
goes on. And it seems we really lost a
lot of that now for one reason or
another. And you said we're a very
youth-obsessed culture. We all think we
have all the answers to the world in our
pockets here. Instead, we tend to use
this stuff for very superficial reasons.
And, yeah, there's just a massive wealth
of knowledge and perspective that is
just sitting there untapped by a lot of
society today.
And I think my generation, the boomers,
were particularly guilty of that. And
that's a great point that Neil Howe
brings up in his book, is just how we
just try to move away from everything
our parents believed in and how the
millennials are very different that way.
And I think that's really bullish for
America. I think millennials are going
to lead us out of this fiasco my
generation has got us into. I hope so.
I think you're an exer, aren't you? You're
not a boomer. You're an exer. I'm an
exer. Yeah. Yeah. We're the ignored ones
who just want to be left alone and watch
the world burn. But that's right. You
were the guys who said don't trust
anybody over 30, right?
And I have to say I was not of that
mindset. I just value the older
influences of my life greatly. And that
was a tremendous benefit for us, maybe
the only thing I had going for me at the
beginning of my career. Well, I got to
tell you personally, I have benefited
extremely by the strategy that you're
recommending here, just leveraging the
expertise, the experience and the insight
of those who have gone before me and
learned from the school of hard knocks,
particularly learning about not just
what to avoid, which is obviously very
useful, but hearing from them what
really works. You can save yourself years
to decades sometimes of frustration and
hard learning if you just listen closely
to the people who are willing to share
their success stories with you.
Absolutely. All right. Well, thank you
for sharing your insights with us, my
friend. Look forward to having you back
on the program anytime you'd like to
come back on everybody else. Thanks so
much for watching. Thanks, Adam.
