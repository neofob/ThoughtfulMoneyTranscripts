Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
According to the latest government data, the US economy is growing faster than expected.
Inflation is largely under control, jobs are plentiful and consumer households remain resilient.
From this perspective, times are good.
But talk to real consumers and you hear a very different story.
The cost of living is at crippling levels, forcing consumers to stop saving and put an
increasing amount of their living costs on revolving credit, which currently charges
record high APRs.
Consumers looking for new jobs report the market is not nearly as hungry for workers
as the government numbers suggest.
Instead, hiring freezes and layoffs are prevalent.
From their view, times are tight and getting tougher.
Which story is the more accurate one?
And should we expect things to get better or worse from here?
For answers, we're fortunate to turn to Danielle Park, president and portfolio manager for
Venable Park Investment Council, Inc., where she manages millions for some of Canada's
wealthiest families.
She's also proprietor of the daily financial website jugglingdynamite.com.
Danielle, thanks so much for joining us today.
Oh, my pleasure, Adam.
Alright, well look, Danielle, I had the pleasure of meeting you just a couple of days ago up
in Vancouver at Jay Martin's resource investor conference.
We actually got to share a panel together.
I really liked your approach in terms of how you just sort of look at the macro economy.
We spent some time in the green room with Danielle DiMartino Booth afterwards.
Really like how data driven you are, your command of the data, but also kind of when
I like to get into sort of observations about the macro economy that kind of get me a little
bit wound up, I sort of sense we get wound up about the same issues and so I'm excited
to have this discussion with you.
Lots of material to dig through.
If I can, though, let me start at the high level as I like to do with these discussions.
What's your current assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
So I've been at this now just over 25 years as an analyst, Adam, as a professional money
manager and what I've learned in that experience is that we cannot afford to be backward looking.
The only data that is certain is the stuff that's already happened and even some of that
gets revised in retrospect.
So you really have to be forward looking and it's very difficult to predict the future
because a lot of variables, as we've learned in the last few years, can happen.
Pandemics, wars, all kinds of crazy things can happen, but your job as a risk manager
is still to look forward and try and assess probabilities.
And so when I look forward at the current state of the world economy, all of the extraneous
events that have happened in the past few years, I think that we have earned a downturn
in the global economy, we're overdue.
I think we were heading into that in 2019 before the pandemic.
We had an expansion that was driven largely by really low interest rates, but there was
a lot of consumption.
South was peaking out just before the COVID pandemic hit and then we had this really anomalous
period of government stimulus and everything sort of changed the near term trends.
But now I think we've gone back to the longer term pattern, which is, again, a massive amount
of consumption and stimulus has now been consumed and we are heading into the contraction part
of the economy.
In fact, you know, typically when you get to the cutting cycle, although the markets
have been expressly jubilant of the idea of a Fed cutting cycle starting in 2024.
I know from experience that, in fact, that's when the bulk of the job losses actually start
to happen as you approach the cutting and during the recessionary part of the cycle.
And indeed, the worst of the bear market losses also happen once the Fed starts cutting because
they were there in response to the slowing economic picture.
And so I think that's why it's so hard for people to keep their wits about them to not
lose their way with all the noise and flashy stuff that's going on around us.
But you have to always be looking for what can go wrong.
Because if you can get that, if you can protect yourself from the losses, over time, you're
going to prosper better than if you're just chasing the latest trend.
Okay.
Very well said.
You talked sort of more about the downturn in the economy that we've earned, especially
as we head into this contractionary phase, which maybe counterintuitively in folks's
mind will largely start as the Fed is beginning to cut.
People generally tend to think, oh, easing is good.
But its history is pretty clear that when you look at the past number of recessions,
they basically followed a spike in interest rates.
And it was only after we started cutting that the recession really arrived in force.
You didn't talk so much about markets.
You made one comment about market losses.
The brunt of bear markets tend to happen on those rate cutting down cycles as well.
But does that mean that you're somewhat pessimistic for financial asset prices from here?
So for the risk side of the equation, typically during this part of the cycle, when you get
into the disappointment in terms of the economic data and you get revisions, as we saw today,
we had revisions to the 2023 jobs numbers, a reduction of some 430,000 jobs.
It's always sort of typical that you start seeing that because there's a lot of guesstimation
that goes on.
But yes, in terms of the risk cycle, this is the time when typically equities and commodities
and corporate debt all sort of disappoint, especially this cycle, Adam, because as you
know, we've come into this with really euphoric pricing.
We very much had a double top in terms of the broad markets, whether it's the NASDAQ
or the S&P and yes, held up by a handful of big tech names, but it still managed to complete
a double top back to near where we were in the October 2021, so more than two years ago.
And I remember a very similar pattern again in the 2000 cycle and in the 2008/9 cycle,
where you had that rebound on belief that we were going to get to the end of the easing
cycle and cuts and that that was going to solve all the ills.
And in fact, it doesn't solve all the ills because the cutting takes just as long to
filter through in terms of stimulus or relief as the hiking did.
So the hiking took 12 to 24 months to start hitting.
It's really now coming up with the refinancing, especially in the corporate debt market, especially
in households and especially in places like Canada.
But all of that is the reason why people take, you know, get it wrong or mistake the cutting
for, you know, the worst is sorry, the hiking as if the worst is behind us economically,
when in fact, it's only just starting now to really have that drag that that is in the
works.
OK, so now you've done it, Danielle.
You have you've fallen right into one of my favorite topics to talk about, which is the
lag effect.
So you talked about the drag, but that's basically caused by the lag of the tremendous amount
of of increase in the cost of capital that we forced onto the system over the past couple
of years.
So, you know, we deformed this.
So just to make sure I've got your progression correct.
You felt like the system was entering a contractionary phase at the end of twenty nineteen and probably
would have fallen into some sort of recessionary environment or at least slower growth environment
with some some clearing out of of malinvestment associated with that in twenty nineteen.
But then we had covid.
Right.
And then all the rules got thrown out.
We deformed the system to a greater extent, arguably, than it's ever been deformed before.
And at this point, a lot of that artificial intervention that was going on is now being
bled out of the system.
You could use a term I probably way overuse on this channel.
The pig is largely through the python at this point in time.
And so we're set up back to where we were in that twenty nineteen stage, except what's
different this time is we have a system that had become pretty much addicted to incredibly
cheap capital that now is facing a much, much higher capital cost because we've we've jacked
interest rates up so so much.
So everybody that's talking about a soft landing or no landing is essentially saying, well,
there's not going to be a lag effect this time.
And you're nodding as I'm saying this.
But I believe and you correct me here, but I believe that you think there will be a lag
effect.
We're already seeing lots of signs of it.
You mentioned corporations, you mentioned households.
So right now you just wrote a piece about how real rates in the US are now at two point
four percent.
That's the highest they've been since the great financial crisis.
You were citing the work of the folks at Hoizington, which is where Lacey Hunt works.
By the way, he's going to be I'm going to be interviewing him next week.
So I'll get him to weigh on this, too.
But what are the implications of this high real cost of debt right now, given where we
are in the cycle?
So as you'll notice, we've had a lot of layoffs announcements in the in twenty, twenty four
year to date.
The tech sector alone is laid off about twenty five thousand people, a huge amount of white
collar jobs.
And it's it's across the board right from DuPont to IBM to finance sector, you know,
to the tech space.
Everyone is really cutting back on these are the highest as I say, the highest paying jobs
are really in the line of fire.
And what you see at this part of the cycle, Adam, is that the companies become very fixated
on how do they cut their costs.
Right.
So there's a wall of maturities coming for the corporate sector who also borrowed a lot
of money when interest rates were at all time lows under one percent.
In many cases, those had terms to them which are coming up for renewal this year, next
year.
And the interest rates that they're facing are sometimes four and five percent higher
than what they had originally borrowed that money at all at a time when you're already
seeing a downturn in terms of durable goods, in terms of spending by the households, in
terms of capital investment by companies.
So the fixation now is on how do we cut overhead?
How do we lay people off, you know, pull back on investment all to kind of shore up cash
because the companies tend to be terrible at coming into these cycles as well as as
well as households in that they are spending a lot and thinking all is well when rates
are low, when you know, when sales are high and they're often underprepared for the downturn,
even though it's an absolutely natural reoccurring phenomenon, it seems to always strike people
as an utter, you know, unexpected event.
And so what they do initially is they lay people off.
And I think that we're going to see that continue.
It's quite typical when you get the the re steepening of the yield curve, which is what
you were referring to in the initial comments there that, you know, the spread starts to
get positive.
We've come in significantly.
The 10, two year spread was 108 basis points wide back in July.
And it's now almost actually flat.
And now we are likely to see that continue to steepen.
That is typically commensurate with this spike in job losses.
So this is all very textbook stuff that we're starting to see.
And again, it is, first of all, a boost that's often a boost in terms of stocks will sometimes
rally on the idea that the C-suite is cutting their costs.
There's an idea that they'll somehow be able to protect margins, right, profit margins
will go up.
Yeah, because yeah, and the consensus right now is still expecting or hoping for double
digit earnings growth for the S&P looking into the next year.
And that's all again, very typical.
The issue, though, is that sales start to fall more than they can cut costs.
And this is where margins, you know, it's it's one thing to manage your your overhead
and try and maintain your profit margin if your sales are steady or increasing.
But if they start to go down, then it becomes much harder.
And the sales start to diminish, typically because you're laying off so many people.
So all these consumption units in the economy start to become unable to keep up their spending
at the level that they were during full employment.
So again, all very typical stuff.
And it's in that next phase, when stocks realize that their price for protection, perfection,
and expecting, you know, starting at ridiculous price to earnings multiples.
And now if we get, as I say, a downdraft, and it's very typical to see earnings come
off 20 to 50%, sometimes Adam at this point in the cycle, when the economy starts contracting.
And so then you realize that the PE that was already rude at 30 times earnings was actually
more like 50 times earnings or 40 times earnings.
And that's when you tend to get a liquidation beginning.
And also, central banks always cut faster than it took them to hike, right.
And again, once they start cutting, they start to look a little panicked, and that really
adds to the fuel of a negative sentiment in terms of people thinking that the world is
ending.
Okay, lots to dig into there.
So you say that, you know, we're seeing a lot of textbook signs right now of going into
a contractionary cycle.
And to your point about January, which is not even over yet, you know, has seen a pretty
pronounced spike in layoffs at big brands across a number of different industry sectors.
If this continues to play out textbook wise in a way that you think it may, what ending
are we in right now in terms of the contraction and maybe let's just start with with job losses?
Do you expect us to just sort of see a steady dribble?
Do you expect us to turn into a flood?
You know, I just want to remind folks when we go back into previous recessions that we've
seen like '08 and '01, you know, you'd have these months where you would have hundreds
of thousands of people laid off every month, like would you expect us to get into that
type of territory?
Well, you know, it's more like a percentage thing.
It's very typical to see the unemployment rise at least a full percent in the first
year of a recession.
And in Canada, which is a very cyclical economy, because 60 percent of our, for example, of
the TSX is materials, financials and the oil and gas sector.
So we tend to be a very cyclically employed economy as well.
So it is common that we would see even a two to three percent increase in our unemployment
rate during a recession.
We've already seen it spike up from just under five percent to about five point eight percent
today.
The U.S. economy, again, that's been a very slow to move.
The unemployment rate is sub four percent still, but it would be very typical to see
the unemployment rate rise a percent or a percent and a half over the next year or so.
And the thing that is also really difficult or challenging in these cycles is that while
unemployment is slow to move at the start of the contraction, you know, people are loathe
to lay people off.
The companies try and keep their, you know, cut back the work week, which we've seen the
average work week has come down.
The amount of people trying to work two and three jobs to make ends meet, that's all very
textbook again.
But the really difficult part is that even when the economy bottoms in terms of GDP and,
you know, you start to get some recovery and typically the stock market will start to sniff
that out at some point, you know, after you've had the central banks cutting for several
months already.
Again, we never get a bottom in the stock market until central banks have been cutting
rates for some time already.
So this idea or hope that we could have seen the bottom in 2022 when they were only increasing
interest rates at that time would be extremely unusual and anomaly historically.
And what you typically will see is that the unemployment rate will continue to rise even
after the economy is bottomed out.
So that's why it's really hard on household sector who comes into it with low savings
and too much debt.
And we've really seen that in spades in Canada, really bad.
We are worse today than you guys were at the top of your 2006 household sector credit bubble
property mania.
I know you've had a big run in the property market again in the last couple of years,
but relative to Canada, you guys are really sober because we're amateurs when it comes
to housing bubbles relative to you guys have lost our banana up here.
It is horrendous.
And so I'm really worried about the Canadian economy this time.
We're much less diversified.
We're much more levered.
And I think that, you know, even if the U.S. doesn't have to have a deep recession this
cycle, and let's not forget, Adam, that you had a very relatively mild recession the last
time the tech bubble burst in 2000.
It wasn't really until 2001 that you had some sort of contraction.
But the stock market still fell more than 50 percent.
And I'm talking the broad market and of course, the NASDAQ lost 80 percent and took 15 years
to recover its prior cycle.
And we are really back at that kind of extreme valuation when it comes to love and adoration
for the tech sector.
We've really gone overboard again here.
The A.I. phenomenon, you know, just belief that somehow that was going to change the
world overnight.
That's all fed into it.
And of course, we still have all the crazy, you know, bullish sentiment, speculative fever.
We still have, you know, a sentiment at all time highs and lots of people doing.
How do I play this daily sort of mentality?
And all that tells me that we haven't yet seen the bottom here.
All right, so haven't yet seen the bottom is, I don't know, it's kinder terminology
than maybe, hey, we are really diluting ourselves and being excessively speculative and we could
be setting ourselves up for some really painful losses here.
And I don't want to put those words in your mouth, but just kind of connecting a lot of
the dots from what I hear you saying, I get the impression that you think that we could
be at one of those cycle highs that we look at when we look at the historic charts and
say, boy, this really looks like the type of euphoria and lack of worry about the future
that investors tend to exhibit right before the wheels come off and you have some pretty
big market corrections like 50% generally or whatnot.
So how worried are you that we are really sort of at that danger zone right now?
I don't see any reason why we shouldn't expect a downturn like we've seen in the last two
cycles because we really haven't mended anything in terms of the lack of rules and controls
on financial speculation in the whole sector.
We have a lot of really crazy retail products that have come to market in the low rate environment
Adam, which was that suppression of more than a decade when money was free.
That was a horrible training ground.
I've likened it to those of us who like to run or hike that it was training people to
run only downhill and now we're into the mountainous terrain and they're realizing that they can
barely walk flat, nevermind scale mountains.
That's really what we're dealing with here.
We have a whole generation of people who don't understand anything about the value of money
or how investments are valued and I don't even blame them because they've been trained
really by, as I say, this environment where everyone was getting free credit and it was
as if it was paying to borrow money at one point there when the opposite a few years
ago.
So we really set people up for a big failure here and it's the financial sector in general.
I'm very critical of the salesmanship in the financial sector because I've seen it over
and over again.
They have this vested purpose in getting people to buy the riskiest assets, the junkiest junk
that they wrap in all these fancy marketing labels.
We're seeing that with Bitcoin ETFs today but we've seen it with all kinds of private
credit and private equity.
Again, these used to be the purview of billionaires who could afford to put a little bit of capital
into something that was really speculative and know that they may probably lose that
money but there's a small chance they could make something over time.
What we've really got in the last few years is this obsession with trying to win money
instead of investing and it's been a tricky time to be someone who is trained in taking
measurements because it was as if your whole body of knowledge was irrelevant.
If you would do analysis as a fundamental analyst, I would do work on certain asset
classes or companies or sectors and determine that it was probably 30% over fair value and
yet it would go up for a considerable period of time.
You have to be really, as I say, a grown-up, sober, you have to continue to have a discipline
because if you don't, you really will fall for any scam that's going.
I think, again, the internet and the social media bonanza has really kept us all very
click-orientated, short-term focused and that's really been perfect for the financial pariahs
out there, the predatory environment that sucks people in.
Look at the Robin Hood craze where everyone was seduced by flashing lights and beeps to
take on all kinds of gambling risk and that's really gutted the strengths out of the household
sector, out of a lot of the companies too.
As you know, Adam, there's something like 40% of the smaller, more economically sensitive
Russell 2000 companies today are negative, burning cash, don't make enough to actually
keep their doors open if they can't access free money, so you've got a whole bunch of
people in the real estate sector, there was a bunch of private investors, individuals
buying up properties that didn't make any sense.
I was writing about it two years ago, even when rates were, mortgage rates in Canada,
you could get a mortgage rate of 1.5%, but people were paying so much for these properties
that they were still negative carry, even at that and they were subsidizing that out
of household income thinking, oh well, it's an investment, it doesn't matter, I'll just
refinance it later.
That wall of refinancing is now coming up, a lot of people took out five-year terms during
the pandemic which are coming up for renewal this year, next year and those rates that
they're facing, even if the central bank is back to cutting sometimes in the second half
of 2024, that doesn't mean mortgage rates will be back under 2% anytime soon and so
the negative carry on those properties is going to continue to erode the cash flow which
is increasingly declining and that's going to bring more things to want to be liquidated
and sold and it's that liquidation phase that we really are waiting for because all of the
ingredients is there and liquidation means people are indiscriminate selling in the way
that they've been indiscriminately buying the past few years.
So there's a lot of opportunity in that, but only for the people that are very careful
about preparing for it in advance.
All right, I'm making a big earmark here to make sure that near the end of the discussion
we get to ways in which people could prepare in advance for that, what you think might
be some prudent ways for that.
Danielle, you do such a great job of packing like 20 things that I want to dig into your
answers and I want to talk in a moment about the Canadian market and how in many areas
it is giving and we have a number of Canadian viewers of this program, so obviously I want
to make sure that they get some good Canadian content, but I think for a lot of US viewers,
Canada is offering a preview of coming attractions given how your economy is set up.
One you talked about how it's more concentrated, so it's probably going to be more sensitive
to some of the dynamics we're talking about, but also your housing market, you have a different
mortgage duration structure in Canada and I think it's something like 20 plus percent
of your mortgages rerate every year, maybe even more than that because you have a certain
amount of people that take out variable mortgages from day one.
And so the lag effect and its impact on the housing market will be felt presumably much
faster in your country than it will be here.
Let me ask you this question first though, again, just to try to do a little bit of counterbalancing
here.
We just got the Q4 GDP numbers for the US and they came out at 3.3% versus 2% expectations,
so that was a five sigma beat when you look at the distribution curve of what analytics
expectations were, so the narrative, at least this week here in the US is what recession
worries?
Economy is growing much stronger than anybody could have hoped for.
Janet Yellen, former Fed chair, now head of the treasury, was just interviewed and she
said she thinks that 2024 is going to be "a very good economic year".
She lists a whole bunch of reasons why, consumer confidence, their spending, jobs are strong
and then she concludes by saying, "I see no reason why that can't continue."
So you've got people on that side of the story saying, "Listen, you bearish guys, you always
try to see any kind of puff of cloud on a beautiful blue sky day.
Obviously there's a lot of other stuff going on and you've done a good job of reciting
a litany of all the things that you look at, but what's your counter to that?"
So the first thing is no offense to Ms. Yellen, but if you listen to her, you would have made
catastrophic errors repeatedly throughout your life in terms of finance.
Those people are meant to be cheerleaders for the economy, they want to get reelected,
that's their job.
I'm not saying they're bad at their job, clearly they are in positions of power and have maintained
that a very successful bureaucratic career, but having said that, there's never a politician
that's going to look forward and say, "Hey guys, I think storms are coming, you better
take shelter", because they have this belief that if you say anything like that, you're
going to make it worse in terms of rising concern or making people more defensive and
that as they pull back, you're going to make the downtown worse.
So their job is to be the economic cheerleaders, that's for sure.
The second thing about GDP numbers is they are, as you know, backward looking.
They will continue to revise those over the next several quarters, sometimes years after
the fact, Adam, and guess what?
They always revise them down, right?
So the first estimates are always more optimistic and positive, but again, backward looking.
The other factor there, of course, is that we know, and Daniel DeMartino Booth has done
some great work on this in terms of the additional stimulus that was flowing into the US economy
just out of handouts to small businesses up until even the summer, and those were not
in any of our models in terms of expectations because they were just random handouts that
continued and many of them fraudulent and many of them will be clawed back.
So this gets to my point about, you can make things look great in the near term by all
kinds of means, but at some point in the retrospect, they start to become downsized.
And I think that they could, what Ms. Yellen is talking about there, you could see that
they try and do more of that.
I mean, it is an election year, no one has to tell you that.
So they are doing everything they can to placate the masses.
The thing here is that the business cycle has never been arrested permanently and no
election has ever been able to stave it off other than there's just too much weight to
the overall economy that the government doesn't have enough means to offset it with handouts.
And you've got, as I say, this huge default cycle unfolding across, whether it's student
debt, whether it's bankruptcy surging 30%, I mean, this is real stuff happening in the
real economy and just pointing out hopes and dreams doesn't counteract the weight of that.
So the other thing I would like to point out is that, again, you didn't have a big recession
in 2001, actually, in Canada, we didn't have a recession at all in 2001 cycle and our stock
market still fell 50% and our corporate debt market still is highly correlated with the
equity cycle.
We still had a significant amount of layoffs.
And the lesson that Canada took, unfortunately, you were saying we're a precursor or a warning
for you in America.
The irony of that, of course, is that we followed your playbook to a T. So the reason that Canada
didn't have such a challenging time in the 2008 recession and that our housing market,
we did have a downturn, but it really rebounded very quickly, is that we did not follow down
the path of the junk debt that was propping up the U.S. housing market, the securitization
of all that junk debt.
The big short factors were not widely prevalent in the Canadian market.
We wanted them to be, don't get us wrong, the politicians were calling for a replication
in Canada of your liar loans and zero principal payment, interest only, all that.
We started to follow you, but fortunately, you were just that much ahead of us.
And when the wheels started to come off in the credit markets in 2007, our government
pulled back from some of the things that were about to be approved or widely spread here.
But the lesson that was taken in Canada was, unfortunately, that we were superior or somehow
conservative, you know, our Mark Carney, the head of our Bank of Canada, became widely
lauded and went on to head the Bank of England and the Financial Stability Committee.
And really, Canada got this rap as this really special, prudent place.
In fact, we just got lucky because we didn't get into all the craziness in time for the
big collapse.
But we went on to replicate you the last 10 years in that we have really doubled down
on the housing bubble.
So I took our playbook and then you put it on steroids.
Exactly.
As did China, by the way.
And I think that's a major factor for the world, too.
You know, the second largest economy next to the United States, they really took a playbook.
Canada and China were really Australia, New Zealand.
Some of the commodity centric countries were really in cahoots, so to speak, with China
and its demand and its stimulus that it brought in after the 2009 collapse.
And they really set about, you know, building out the property sector of all kinds in China,
which took a huge amount of commodities.
So the commodity producers rebounded more quickly.
And we saw that, you know, the U.S. struggled more.
But now we have the opposite conditions where China is in the middle of a big bust happening
in their property sector, as you know.
Their stock market has fallen back to where it was in 2005, for heaven's sake.
And my concern with regard to the Canadian stock market, we haven't seen anything like
the S&P 500 style appreciation.
We've had basically, you know, the peak of the cycle in 2008, our TSX got to about 15,000,
today around 21,000.
We've had about 2% a year of growth, if you average that out over that time.
But the problem here today is, again, 30% of the market being in financials, which are
highly levered to this whole imploding credit problem in the household sector.
And we've got now the probability that the TSX could retouch 11,000, which would be almost
a 50% drop from here, with just kind of being a run of the mill recession.
And we know from history that the worst recessions, the deepest and the most difficult to recover
from, are the ones that are led by housing.
So that's why I'm really concerned, particularly about Canada.
Now, on the upside from that, we desperately need lower prices.
We have had such a misallocation of capital over the past many years, as people obsessed
about granite counters and, you know, adding all sorts of other things to their homes,
or having two and three homes, a ski chalet and a cottage, all of them with mortgages,
all of them levered, all of them dependent on very low interest rates.
And of course, none of that made us more productive, none of that invested anything that was going
to produce income down the road.
So we really had a very destructive period in our economy.
And I think we're going to be paying for that.
The one positive note I would add is the immigration influx, which we have had, which has been
much better than most developed economies, certainly better growth rate than, you know,
in Europe or the UK, or even in the United States.
Now it's very difficult and problematic in the short run to absorb millions of new people
over a short period of time.
And there's a lot of friction and, you know, waiting lines and it drove up rents and it's
caused the inflationary impulse to get worse in Canada.
But on the upside, those people over time will help us to reboot our economy because
we have an aging demographic here as well.
So it is an investment.
That's what an investment looks like.
And this is, I guess, the point that I'd like to make above all else, which is we've become
so misguided in our idea of what an investment looks like.
People think an investment is something that, you know, makes you X dollars right away and
every year thereafter it grows by a certain amount.
And if they don't get that, they're disappointed.
And that's ultimately not what an investment is.
An investment is something where you put capital in with the idea that it will add to your
prosperity or your efficiency or your innovation or your, you know, your products that help
you in terms of making things that the world will want down the road.
So the influx of immigration is actually going to help us, but it's going to be an expense
for a few years here as we help those people get on their feet.
And then we really do have to reboot our economy for the new energy economy.
We have still this, you know, fixation on oil and gas in Canada primarily.
And we really need to build out all kinds of energy and to diversify our economy.
So there's a lot of technological stuff there that's come on stream, which will help us
do that.
But a lot of the policies and subsidies are still antiquated and focused on the wrong
things.
All right, gosh, again, so much to dig into there.
I do very much appreciate your point there about the need to have a renewed respect for
what an investment is.
I've railed many times that we've sort of created, especially in the millennial and
Gen Z generations, a culture of speculation.
We basically taught them that speculating is investing or speculating.
And because governments keep having your back.
Right.
So, you know, people are critical of the young generation and I get it.
I've got a couple of 20 somethings myself.
And they're very critical of this idea that people, you know, the young people don't want
to work and they don't want to pay their share and all this sort of thing.
And I would say, well, what do you think they would take from watching the last 15 years
where, you know, even back twenty three years ago, when the long term capital debacle started
and Alan Greenspan taught the world that we could financialize our way out of everything
and that, you know, they were the maestros in the every every 2008 blow up, you have
the government taxpayers coming to the rescue and people not taking their hits, not taking
their lumps.
You've really just got that on steroids again over the past few years.
So, you know, every time that the that the taxpayers are brought in to bail out financial
institutions or malactors are allowed to get away with breaking all the rules and paying
small fines, you really engender a whole population of people who thinks, well, why should I have
to pay back my student loans or my business debts or the things?
Why would I have to when the whole world is getting a bailout?
And I think that's the mentality that's really brought us down and is going to cost us over
the next while.
Yeah.
And I think kind of tied to that, it's almost been a survival mechanism, which is, you know,
if you're in the younger generation, you're looking at the highly unattainable cost of
living for a middle class lifestyle.
You know, you ask a Gen Z or about buying a house, they've already given up.
Right.
And the only way they see it to potentially being able to do that is, well, maybe if I
buy the right crypto or the right meme stock and I get one of those winning lottery tickets,
well, then that's my way to that lifestyle.
So again, that's just how they've adopted.
I guess that's how I need to invest is to try to get these lottery tickets as opposed
to what you're referring to, which is the old tried and true short term sacrifice in
the near term for a long term greater goal.
That's right.
And you know what?
Again, during the pandemic, there was a lot of people our age, Adam, who thought that
helping their kids and grandkids meant giving them money so they could lever themselves
into overvalued property market.
Right.
That was actually not helping them.
So we have to get away from I saw a stat today.
I think it was what was it, 50 percent of parents say they help their, you know, 20
something and 30 something children make car payments and mortgage payments.
And the point would be that that's actually not helping people.
You know, if a person doesn't have enough income to to pay for a car, the correct thing
to do is actually to walk, drive a bike or take the transit until you save enough.
That's certainly what I did.
And I'm not trying to be holier than thou.
I'm just saying it's normal to be broke when you're young, unless you come from a wealthy
family that gives you money.
And even that doesn't show up as positive over the lifetime of a person if they're given
too much help and they don't develop their own muscles.
So we have to get away from the idea that everybody needs a car and everybody needs
a house.
We need to invest in things like public transit and bike lanes and things so that people can
get around without having to take on a car payment because guess what, then they're building
up their savings and then they have funds to invest in things like their education.
And then the same thing goes with the house.
If you do the math, it's not hard to figure out if it's more cost effective to rent than
it is to buy.
But, you know, this is the millionaire next door.
Remember that great book from, was it the 90s?
Absolutely.
Stan Lee and Danko.
Yeah.
Right.
It's got all the studies.
I've actually interviewed William Danko, one of the living authors of the book.
So yeah.
There you go.
So it shows in there, the studies confirm that it doesn't help people to get them into
things before their time, so to speak.
And it actually, the most intelligent thing to do is find a cheaper rent, share with someone,
find a way to keep your costs low so that you can build up your savings.
And then at some point when property prices come down, and they will Adam, I definitely
don't buy into this idea that property prices are at a permanently high plateau and they
will never come back down again.
That simply flies in the face of all historical evidence.
And I would submit that at some point, and there are certain areas where you can do this.
Nick Gurley, I know you, I think you interviewed Nick, but he does that great, you know, looking
at individual cities and showing where it is more cost effective to rent than buy.
There are some places where the math will make more sense to buy than rent, but right
now the preponderance of area is because pricing, you know, in Canada, home prices basically
doubled in about a four year period.
You know, at the peak of the 2022, in the spring of 2022, our average home price up
here was $850,000 Adam, and we're talking about starter homes around seven and $800,000.
In the big cities where the bulk of the population lives in Vancouver, where we were, or in Toronto
near where I live, the average home price was more like a million dollars.
So again, it's just bonkers.
It makes no sense.
And yet people were thinking that if they didn't buy that, you know, that they were
missing out.
The FOMO was incredible, and young people were being encouraged by older people that
they had to get on the property ladder ladder.
You're going to recognize all this, of course, from your own experience in the United States
cycle in the 2006 episode, where, you know, immigrants and every person was thinking they
had to somehow do anything possible to get themselves into property at any price.
Well, that's obviously a terrible idea.
And we went back to that.
Maybe not as crazy as you guys, but during COVID, when that money really started flowing,
that's exactly what happened.
And zero rates.
You know, I love to talk about a mortgage calculator.
You can find them online for free, and you know, the reality is that most people could
not afford to buy the home that they have today if they were looking to put a, you know,
a good down payment down and borrow at current rates.
So all the people that think they're going to have a ton of buyers coming out of the
woodwork here, you know, in the spring, there's a lot of hope about hopium about the spring
right now that, you know, at the current prices, they're just completely unaffordable.
So yeah, you might see a sort of elation again and people thinking, oh, great, even if the
central banks were to start cutting rates, the bond market is always already, you know,
rallied significantly since the fall, such that mortgage rates have come down a percent.
But we're still talking about 5% ish, you know, rather than less than 2% ish at the
very bottom in rates during the pandemic.
So in 5% is a really modest rate of interest historically.
As you know, Adam, it's not a high mortgage rate.
So it's not that rates are important.
It's that prices remain important.
Yeah.
All right.
So Danielle, I knew I liked you.
You said so many things that I want to respond to and one I'll just squeeze in is there's
all sorts of reasons, many of which I've talked about previously on this program, why you
don't want to come in and become a financial backstop for your kids because they don't
develop the muscles to overcome adversity and learn how to do all this stuff and all
that.
And I think the huge issue that we saw where people were saying, "Yeah, I'm helping my
kids get into one of these properties," is they put money down to help the kid get into
the overpriced house with the big mortgage and now the kid is stuck as a mortgage surf
for the rest of their life.
So it's definitely not helping those kids that actually, once they're in there, even
with that initial parental help, can't afford it.
They're just trapped in that thing.
And people don't stay.
People don't stay, Adam, as you know.
The reasons people move are divorce and change of job.
They need to be mobile for career purposes.
Space no longer fits.
There's a whole bunch of reasons that people ultimately don't stay in a property indefinitely
infinitum and, in fact, what they more likely do is develop a very negative sentiment and
start thinking, "I got to get out of this thing."
And that's already starting, not just in the short-term rental cohort where people piled
in thinking they could rent from seeing short-term rentals and keep paying.
And now they're realizing that they're subsidizing that monthly and the panic starts to become
really palpable.
And I think that's already beginning.
Okay.
And that's what I want to dig into.
So we're beginning to run low on time and I want to make sure I get to your market outlook
and how you think people can prudently prepare for what's coming from an asset allocation
standpoint.
But as I mentioned earlier, your housing market is on a faster timeline than mine here in
the US, given how your mortgages are set up.
Given the craziness that you've described for us of the current market there, as mortgages
are starting to re-rate at these much higher mortgage rates on a relative basis, are you
beginning to see any bursting or initial bursting at all of the property market there?
Yes, for sure.
We're seeing north of the city or actually in and around, it's called the greater Toronto
area, in and around the city of Toronto, there's many municipalities, by the way, where millions
of the new immigrants, some 60% of the 4 million people that have come to Canada in the last
few years, have migrated into this high population area called the GTA.
And all the bedroom communities within commute, an hour commute kind of thing of the city,
have saw during the pandemic a whole bunch of people moving out to the suburbs, whether
it was for work, for home, or just to get more green space because concern about the
virus or what have you.
A lot of people, as I said, went to the cottage country, which is in this area or ski areas
and bought up properties and already, and I tracked several realtors, mortgage lenders
in this area, and they are posting constantly the listings that are coming up by power of
sale.
I have several friends in the legal community who are extremely busy right now with the
power of sale flow that is coming through the court system, and this is not just alternate
lenders now, this is big banks, the big five or big six banks, as we call them in Canada,
which have supposedly the more conservative loan portfolio, but again, during the pandemic,
they were doing all sorts of crazy things, including letting people negatively amortize
their interest and add it to the principal.
So you've got these mortgages, which have grown in terms of amortization periods from
what was always conventional 20, 25 years.
Many of them have mortgages now in the 35, 40, 50 and beyond in terms of the time it's
going to take them to pay off.
Some are literally getting the little infinity symbol on their statement because there's
no chance that they're going to be able to pay it off at the current way that they're
doing.
So again, what we're noticing is liquidation starting.
We're also noticing in a lot of suburbs, people setting homes on fire.
I mean, if that's not desperation, I don't know what is, Adam, but they are seeing price
declines of 20%, already 30%.
And if you look at the national averages, it's come off perhaps 12% so far, but in cities
like Toronto, I mean, we're having the lowest home sales numbers that we've seen in 40 years
in many areas.
So I remember the 1980 cycle, I was a teenager back then, but my father was a builder.
I remember it very well, how he had to carry homes for a couple of years before he could
find buyers.
And that is typical.
It is normal for a housing cycle to take four or six years before it bottoms and then for
prices to not recover for many years after that back to the prior peak.
So this is why if you come into them heavily levered, there's very little chance that the
majority of people will be able to wait that out or wait until prices recover.
And so that is the issue, the more desperation spreads.
And again, as I say, this is still with unemployment at, historically, the average unemployment
rate in Canada has been 8%.
We're not yet at six, we're only at 5.8.
And we're already seeing great stress in terms of defaults and consumer solvencies, the trustees
and bankruptcy are up 30% volume year over year.
So they're coming into their very busy period.
And so they should because they went through a time of extremely low volume when everyone
was getting free money and deferrals.
All right.
Well, so many of these conversations that I have with experts like you, it really does
come down to the criticality of what happens with employment from here.
If the employment market really starts to crack and we start having job losses at any
really sizable scale, then I think all of the remaining underpinnings kind of keeping
this whole edifice together really start breaking and it kind of becomes game on for those contractionary
forces that you talked about at the beginning.
You're nodding as I'm saying all this.
All right.
I could, I mean, Danielle, I could keep talking with you for hours and hours here.
So we're just going to have to have you back on the program in the future.
As we begin to wrap up here, what is your general market outlook over say the next year
or so?
What are you expecting in 2024 from the markets?
And if you can talk to an allocation standpoint, what assets do you like, do you not like in
terms of your earlier comment about helping people, people who prudently prepare today
and hopefully avoid a lot of this pain and I don't know, maybe position for some game.
You tell me.
Yeah.
Well, we made actually 8% in 2008 in our client portfolios because we came into that downturn
well positioned.
Now it caused this, we had to do it in advance.
You know, it's very hard to make the changes while the sort of world's on fire.
You kind of have to be, do your analysis in advance and have good personal discipline
about how long and how patient you are for these trends to unfold.
But basically the nub of the matter is that during the panic phase or the liquidation
phase, when layoffs are rising and defaults are rising, that's typically when you want
to be holding lots of things that are liquid like cash.
US cash for Canadians is always a good spot to see some capital gains without having to
take on equity risk.
Also in terms of government bonds, we have a significant allocation in our portfolios
to provincial municipal government bonds at this point.
Those are also one of the few asset classes that rise in value while the risk side is
falling out of bed.
The commodity space always takes a pretty big hit during a recession.
You know, the oil price in Canada is quite significant in terms of people's sentiment
and business models and factors that they do in terms of anticipating earnings.
It's common to see the price of WTI go down to the 40s.
It has peaked during the Ukraine invasion many, many months ago, but it is still in
and around the 70 range here, so you could see significant downside.
People think of commodities as some kind of a diversifier in terms of some of the other
types of risk.
However, during a recession, they tend to take a hit as well, so you have to be careful.
The producers typically are just equities, so they all too will trade off as people are
selling anything and everything to raise cash in this environment.
I would suggest that, you know, I was saying this during the ultra low rate environment
and I do know some people did this and I'm so grateful when they say, "Hey, I did that
during the low rate environment," which was to pay off their debt.
I said if we could use low rates to get out of debt, when we get to the next part of the
cycle, you'll be, now that's what you call a real investment, something where you, you
know, use your cash flow to pay off your bills so that you have net positive cash flow that
you can now divert into savings for the rest of your life.
I mean that is a huge positive, so it's still not too late if people have cash.
I know a lot of people think they have to put all their life savings in the stock market
regardless and they will be sitting there with mortgages on their personal home and
have money in the stock market, non-registered money and I often look at those scenarios
and say you should be paying off your debt with this cash.
It's not really investment money so long as you have personal liabilities because they're
not tax deductible in Canada.
I understand they are in America but I would still suggest to people that it is not such
a great thing to have debt even if it's tax deductible because it's much better to have
things paid for, your stability and your peace of mind and your ability to save will be so
greatly enhanced by that.
So I just say, you know, look at your overall portfolio in terms of your, how much of it
in house equity, how much is it in equities.
Right now the ratio of people that have any money in the safest bonds is about 4% when
you look at the overall household allocation and about 10% cash which is actually higher
than I've seen in many portfolios when people show us their sort of holdings and say what
do you think and that's not surprising, right, because the financial industry is really populated
primarily by sales people whether it's realtor sales people or investment product sales people
and so they make their money by getting you to give them their cash and they put it into
these various things.
So you have to always be very sober in that in terms of an individual and look, as I say,
if you can take cash out of some of these riskier things, it's not too late to do that.
Certainly if you're going to reduce your leverage so you're one of the few stable people and
then you can have building up your savings, making your buy list because if I'm right
about the setup that we've got here, it's going to be probably just as good as what
we saw in 2000, 2008 and that means you could have a very significant decline in some of
these asset prices where everything will be on sale all at once and then it'll be hard
to pick from all the things that are great value.
All right, so it sounds like priority should be capital preservation so that you have that
dry powder to deploy when valuations are much more attractive.
Just one comment on bonds.
Obviously, and I think when you talk about cash, you probably mean putting cash in things
like T-bills or Canada's equivalent of that or whatnot, right?
But also, you talked about the municipal government bonds but longer duration bonds, would you
expect those to do well in this type of contraction that you're expecting, particularly if the
central banks are chasing it all the way down with rate cuts and therefore you'll get some
cash flow from the bonds but you'll also get appreciation as rates go down?
Sure.
So the long-term treasuries like the 20 and 30-year issues, they came off 40% in 21, 22.
So that was a horrendous bear market for those assets.
Now, we don't hold those in client accounts because of the propensity for that kind of
extreme downward skew is very disruptive or unsettling for most people.
But basically now, you're also looking at a time when they have been greatly discounted.
Now, things that have come off 40% may not get back up to par because again, if they
were issued when rates were next to nothing, I'm not suggesting we're going to be back
at zero rates in the next year.
I really hope we're not, Adam.
I really hope that we've learned something from the prior period and we've not decided
to go back to the zero bound but we shall see.
That is impossible to know at this point.
But basically, I do think the long end of the treasury curve is for the people that
can stomach it and I say that with all seriousness because a lot of people just would find that
kind of volatility too unnerving but there is an opportunity there for even a 20% rise
in some of that long dated stuff that had sold off so significantly in the past couple
of years.
So I think that that's more like an equity market style volatility but it would be one
of the few things that rises when equities fall typically.
And the 10-year even is a less extreme positioning that you can take the 10-year treasury again
sold off.
Now it rose something like 14% in the fourth quarter of 2023 so we have participated in
some of that gains already and that's great but again, it is the more volatile end of
the paper so the person has to always be careful about what portion of their money they want
in that kind of volatile asset because you don't want to be scared out of it at the wrong
time.
All right, very well said.
I feel like we're just scratching the surface of the iceberg here, Danielle.
I look forward very much to having you on more in the rest of 2024.
Two last questions for you.
First one, for folks that have really enjoyed this conversation, perhaps this is their first
introduction to you, where can they go to follow you and your work?
So I write a daily blog for free.
I've done it for 16 years.
I think I'm in year 17.
It's called jugglingdynamite.com.
It's named after a book I wrote of the same name and our firm website is vinnablepark.com
but basically I do media regularly and write on the blog daily and most people follow me
there.
All right and Danielle, when I edit this, I'll put up the links to both your websites
on the screen so folks know exactly where to go.
Folks will also put links in the description below this video too if you want to just go
there with one click.
All right and something I've been doing recently with other speakers I'd like to do with you,
Danielle, which is we've been talking about money and finances the whole time here.
What's one non-money related non-financial investment you'd encourage folks to consider
adopting in their lives?
For me, that's really simple, Adam, and I think you would agree too.
It's your health and I don't mean that to sound trite.
I mean, I spoke about this mentality that's developed of governments will save us, will
back us, will bail us out.
I would say we've developed that kind of an attitude with respect to pharmaceutical interventions
and some kind of hopelessness that everyone gets very unhealthy as they age and I would
suggest to you that that self-reliance piece is really important.
Investing in your own strength and stability doesn't just mean trying to live debt-free
and building up your savings and trying to avoid gambling, which is a highly destructive
occupation, but also just figuring out ways and that means just exercise, diet, eating,
but also your mental health, things that give you strength and stability mentally.
Not letting the world grab your eyeball and treat you with like a, give you severe ADD
every five seconds, but actually decide when you're going to view and what you're going
to intake and how much you're going to invest in terms of your own strength and calm.
I spend a lot of time keeping myself calm because I really think that is where our true
power comes from.
Really well said.
Amen, sister.
I got to meet you and your partner there in Vancouver and very obviously you guys take
very good care of yourselves physically and having met you, I can attest to that degree
of calm and poise, so you're living your advice and I couldn't agree with it more.
Danielle, this has just been wonderful.
Thank you so much.
Like I said, I'd love to have you back on this channel later on multiple times this
year if you're game for it.
Hopefully you are.
Oh, Adam, I'm a big fan of you and of your new channel and I've followed your work for
some time, so I'm just very appreciative that you thought to ask me.
Thank you.
Oh, that's a huge honor.
All right.
Well, we'll see you soon, Danielle.
Thanks so much for coming on.
Thank you.
All right.
Well, now is the time when the program where we bring in the lead partners from New Harbor
Financial, one of the endorsed financial advisory firms by Thoughtful Money, to both react to
what Danielle just said and also talk about anything that caught their attention in the
markets over the past week.
This week, I'm joined by lead partner Mike Preston.
John Loder has the week off.
Mike, how are you doing and what did you think of Danielle?
I'm great, Adam.
Thank you.
I really enjoyed that.
That was just so fact-packed.
That talk was a little over an hour, I think.
I've got a page and a half of notes.
I just can't believe how much Danielle was able to cram into that short period of time.
So I know we don't have a whole lot of time, so what I'm going to try to do here is just
reiterate or recap what I thought the highlights were of her talk.
It's obvious that Danielle has a lot of experience.
She says she's got 25 years experience in this industry.
Her firm manages funds for wealthy families, and she talked a couple different times about
how our money manager has to be forward-looking.
It's absolutely right, and it's really the hardest thing about this business, and it's
the hardest thing for an individual investor as well.
You have to try to predict the future, and it's pretty difficult when the Fed keeps tinkering
with things all the time, and certainly have been over the last 15 or 20 years, but you
have to position yourself ahead of time, and things can go on a lot longer than you think
they can.
So this bubble has gone on a lot longer than we thought it could, and we've been publicly
saying that we've been fairly conservative for the last handful of years, and so you
can feel out of step.
You can even look like an idiot, and you can look like an idiot now, or you can look like
an idiot later, basically, is your choice.
Classy John Hussman quote, right?
Yeah, and it's the truth, and sometimes you can look like an idiot for a long time, but
you have to position ahead of time.
You have to make a call.
So many in this business are afraid to make a call, and what I heard from Danielle is
somebody that's not afraid to make a call.
She talked about a double top in the S&P.
It's true, the S&P 500 so far has put in what you would call a double top.
Just today, the S&P hit an all-time high yet again.
We're starting to see some signs of weakening.
The volume is slower, mid-cap stocks, like the Russell 2000 has been weaker again versus
the S&P 500.
Some of these things are warning signs, but nobody rings a bell at the top, and we're
not even saying that this is the top.
In fact, there's no real indication that we're going to turn over imminently.
That's the hard thing.
Our short-term indicators are still bullish.
We did a video yesterday on what some of our indicators are.
They're telling us so far that the market is likely to go higher, and in fact, if I
had to guess or if I had to bet on it, I'd say the market is likely to put in a little
bit more of a blow off top here.
That's what the indicators are saying, but at the same time, the turn could come at any
moment.
You have to be somewhat positioned ahead of time.
We're at around 38% or 39% stock exposure, 15% or more of that is hedged with an out
of the money put option down at 4,500 on the S&P, which takes us immediately down to the
low 20s, 22%, 23%, 24% on that type of pullback, so we are positioned for that ahead of time.
At the same time, we're trying to ride the market a little bit if we get a little bit
more of a move.
Danielle talked about so many other things.
She talked about the spread, the 10-2 spread, and I actually have that chart up, and I'm
going to try to share it here.
I think it's pretty important.
It's been talked a lot.
We've all been talking a lot about it over the last bunch of years, but finally, it looks
like we're close to coming back to the zero bound.
This is right from the St. Louis Fed.
The St. Louis Fed, for people that don't know about it, has a whole bunch of great charts
for free that anybody can access, and this chart goes back to 1980 or so, and you could
see every time in this blue line here is the 10-2 spread, spread between 10-year bonds
and two-year bonds.
Every time it's gone negative and then gone back positive, there's been a recession.
The recession is in gray here, so every single time.
Now we've been going on the longest time since a recession, since the 2008 recession.
This COVID recession here, in my opinion, could be hardly called a recession, but after
getting inverted by more than one point, we're only about 0.2% inverted here, so it wouldn't
take much for this to un-invert.
Our view is that short-term rates will come down.
It seems like the market is anticipating the Fed's going to cut rates, but they don't totally
believe it because short-term rates are still up there near 5%, and it's the short-term
rates that the Fed controls, but still, the market is speaking here, the bond market that
is, and it looks like we're not too far from what we would call an un-inversion, so that's
a bad thing, ultimately.
Don't forget what Danielle said about layoffs and stock market losses.
She said that most of the damage comes after the Fed cuts.
We certainly saw that in the housing crisis in 2008, 2009.
Be careful for what you wish for, because when the Fed is easing, things are generally
falling apart, and when you do so from these levels of the most overvalued market we've
ever seen, with the most constant intervention that we've ever seen, and really, with no,
in my opinion, plan B, Fed doesn't really have a backup plan, I think it's just more
or the same, the downside could be severe, and it could be long.
So just to recap my thoughts about what she said, she ended with a little statement about
speculation versus investment, we've all, or many of us have been drawn into speculation
over the last bunch of years because the Fed drove us crazy with this, there is no alternative
in the zero interest rate policy, but investment is more important now than ever, speculation
is almost certainly going to be punished.
And she said payoff debt.
There's a lot of risk in the current environment, the way that the Fed has constantly intervened
over the last 20 years.
Really one of the best things you can do, like Danielle said, payoff debt.
First thing you should do, payoff debt.
Take cashflow and or assets, reduce debt.
You put yourself in a much safer position.
Also think about buying hard assets, gold, silver, and even real estate, although real
estate is a difficult one, as Danielle just talked about, the northern part of Toronto
there has just seen a ridiculous bubble, even more so than in your neck of the woods it
sounds like in San Francisco, although I'm not sure if Danielle's from Toronto or Vancouver,
I'm sorry about that Adam, I think you met in Vancouver.
I met in Vancouver, she's from Toronto.
Alright, well good.
And then she finished by saying a few things about the long bond.
The long bond I think is going to go higher.
And that probably will coincide with the stock market drop or crash.
I believe that the 10 year bond will go back below 3%.
It's about 4.2 right now.
If that happens it would be a 10 to 15% increase or capital gain in the value of the bond and
you get paid to wait.
Everything I would say should be carefully considered in terms of your exposure or your
allocation but if you have no exposure to longer bonds, 10%, 15% in the 10 to 20 year
Treasury makes a lot of sense here.
So with that I will pause and let you speak.
Great.
I'll take it over because you're going right in the direction I wanted you to do, which
is Danielle did a good job of giving a long litany of reasons to be concerned.
I mean who knows what's going to happen from here, we're going to watch and that's why
you're on this program every week with me here.
Mike is helping us keep track of it in real time.
But she I think definitely made a good case for hey, the lag effect is real.
It is going to matter this time.
Folks that are singing soft landing, no landing, they're basically depending upon it being
different this time.
And it may not be in fact based on a lot of the indicators she looks at, she said, look,
this is sort of the textbook set of indicators I would expect to see going into a contractionary
phase.
So if we go into one of the general magnitude it sounds like that she's expecting that I
think Mike you think is certainly possible, a lot of regular investors, one that sounds
kind of scary and a lot of them are saying, well, geez, how can I position for that?
How should I be starting to prepare in advance prudently like Danielle was saying, but maybe
also still playing in the game to a certain extent now, but just reducing my risk exposure
if we did start heading down into a contractionary environment.
And so this gets to some big news that I just want to share with folks here, which is that
you all heard me talk about the security exam that I was studying for the other week and
thankfully passed.
So now I'm able to activate the other big part of thoughtful money that I've been waiting
to do, which is the ability to connect regular investors who are asking these questions with
good professional financial advisors who can just give them free advice.
So folks may remember from my previous company, if you want to have a free consultation, would
I basically encourage everybody to do is to first make the decision, am I going to be
a DIY investor or am I going to work with a financial professional, somebody who can
be my financial quarterback and come up with a plan and probably hopefully even execute
it for me.
Because most people, as we've talked about Mike, they don't have the expertise, they
don't have the bandwidth and many cases they don't have the desire to be the main quarterback
of their financial life and they're looking to outsource to that to a good professional
who can do it.
Now, I think that probably covers most people watching this video and myself included.
I work with a professional financial advisor too.
The key is to find a good one and that's where people have a lot of challenges.
And what I say is try to find one that's been in business for a good while, has a brand
to protect, is in good standing with FINRA and the authorities, but also really like
understands and takes into account the macro topics that we talk about on this channel
with all the guests we have on like Danielle.
And that's where I think the universe gets a lot smaller.
There's a lot of financial advisors who just have played the buy and hold, market's going
to take care of you in the long run, just buy the dips whenever there's a dip.
They're playing the playbook that's actually worked pretty well over the past 10 years
while there's been so much intervention going on.
But a lot of that era I think is ending and as Danielle said even better than I could,
the road ahead is probably going to get a lot more uncertain.
And so that's where you want a good experienced, well-informed financial advisor to advise
you.
So if you can find a good one through your own means, excellent.
That's perfect.
I'm agnostic whom you work with.
But if you want to talk to one so that you can ask your questions and basically just
get some general advice and then figure out what to do, Thoughtful Money is now over to
put you in touch with the financial advisors that you see on this program.
So Mike and John from New Harbor Financial, Lance and his team from Real Investment Advice,
and then Jonathan Wellen's team at Rocklink Investments up in Canada.
And these consultations are totally free.
And Mike, you might want to just take a minute here and just tell folks generally what that
conversation goes like, but this is where you just listen to their questions, you hear
about their personal financial situation.
You give them your advice of, "Hey, if you were a client of ours, these are the type
of things that we would do."
But that's it.
There's no commitment to work with you.
There's no cost to this.
It's just basically a free financial mind meld with a good professional like yourself
and the person can take that advice and do a DIY strategy on their own.
They can bring that advice to their existing financial advisor and say, "Hey, I talked
to these smart guys, do this instead."
Or if they like you guys, they can continue conversations from there.
So anyways, folks, the big news is if you want to set up one of those free consultations,
just go to ThoughtfulMoney.com, fill out the short form there.
You'll be connected with whichever advisor is the best fit or the one that you want to
talk to.
But Mike, if you can just take a minute here and explain to folks what those conversations
are like, what they could expect to have within them, just sort of how they go.
Let folks know.
Yeah, Adam, thanks to you, we've been lucky enough to talk to thousands of people over
the last bunch of years and we've been working with you for more than 10 years.
And our message has really always been the same.
We're happy to talk to people, there's never any obligation.
We have been very, very fortunate to have grown our business quite a bit through this
fashion as well because some of these people decide to work with us.
But I'll tell you how it works, and it's really the best part of my job.
I've been in this business since 1999, so I've been around the block a few times.
I've been hardened, I've seen the ups and downs, I've felt all the emotions, I've gone
through all of the psychology with clients.
Two great bubbles and two crashes so far, and the third bubble we're living in right
now.
So much of what we do is about psychology, and when I connect with somebody on the phone,
I can really feel where they're coming from, where their fears or aspirations are.
And so much of the time, people just want to feel like things are going to be okay.
They want to feel like it's okay to make a mistake, because a lot of times people make
mistakes.
I've made mistakes, I've made lots of mistakes.
I'm completely human, and believe it or not, I don't know what's going to happen next month.
I think I know what's going to happen over the totality of this market cycle.
But we talk to lots of people every week, and if we talk to 20 people, maybe a couple
of them decide to become clients, but there's never a push or an obligation for that.
So what we're offering is a 30-minute conversation, we'll get right into it, talk about what's
going on in your life, what concerns you, and then whoever you're talking to, well if
it's me, I'll tell you exactly how it goes, I'll give you some advice, I'll give you my
opinion right on the spot, I'll share what we're doing, I'll share even details about
what we're doing in our portfolio.
Our attitude is if we try to deliver value to the world, then we're going to get something
back too, and that's exactly what's happened.
So thanks to you Adam, we've been a great beneficiary of all of that, we hope to talk
to a lot more folks, and it's been a fun ride.
So thank you.
Alright, well thank you for all the many people that you've helped over the years, and folks
like I said, all I'm trying to do here is to help get as many people as possible connected
with a good resource to help them have higher odds of building enough wealth to fund their
life goals.
And if you're able to do that on your own, fantastic.
If you're able to get good advice from these free consultations and then use that to find
an advisor in your local area, great.
Or if you like these guys and you think they might be someone you want to work with, that's
fantastic.
I'm just trying to get as many people into a good lifeboat as possible because I hear
from so many folks about just the very human concerns, fears, frustrations they have about
having to be the steward of their own capital in an investing environment that is uncertain
and confusing as the one that we appear to be entering into here, and they just feel
very vulnerable and kind of naked on their own.
And like I said, most people, they don't have the bandwidth, the expertise, or the interest
to do this, but they're still doing it on their own right now and they just feel like
just super exposed and they're afraid they're going to make some sort of catastrophic decision.
So again, folks, if you want to have one of these consultations, go to ThoughtfulMoney.com.
All right, moving on real quick to another bit of good news is not only I think I've
shared with folks here before that I've locked in a date for the Thoughtful Money online
conference that's coming up in March.
And just as a reminder, that's Saturday, March 16th.
But now I've actually got a place to drive you to to actually sign up for that.
That's at ThoughtfulMoney.com/Conference and there you'll be able to see all the speakers
that we've lined up for the event so far and lock in the early bird discount for the event.
Real quick, let me just tell you who's said yes in terms of the faculty.
It's already a fantastic lineup.
We've got Lacey Hunt, we've got Michael Pinto, we've got Stephanie Pomboy, we've got Ted
Oakley, we've got Tom McClelland, we've got Danielle DiMartino Booth, we've got Brent
Johnson and Mike Liebowitz, I was going to talk on bonds, Matt Peipenberg just agreed
to sign on.
So folks, this is becoming like the best of the best of folks that have appeared on Thoughtful
Money so far.
It should be a phenomenal day.
Don't worry if you can't watch live on the actual day on Saturday, that Saturday the
16th if you've got something else going on, because replay videos of the entire conference,
all the presentations and all the live Q&A are going to be sent to everybody within 24
hours of the event's end.
Just a quick reminder too, like I said, if you go now, you'll lock in the early bird
discount price.
If you are a premium subscriber to my substack, you'll get an additional $50 off the price.
So I think the early bird price is like 30% off of what the full ticket price will be.
And then if you're, like I said, a premium subscriber member to my substack, you'll get
an additional $50 off of that 30% discount.
And look, I'm happy if you want to game the system.
It costs $15 a month to sign up for my substack.
If you want to sign up for a month for $15 just to get the $50 off, so you put $35 in
your pocket, I'm totally fine with that.
I think you'll get a lot of other value by being a premium subscriber.
But if it's just that $35 savings that attracts you, hey, go wild on it.
One last thing to let folks know.
Next week is a Fed announcement week, the Federal Open Market Committee is meeting and
releasing their notes.
I'm going to have Fed watcher Axel Merck on this program the day after doing a live reaction
to Jerome Powell's press conference.
So if you want to get a real time debrief by a true Fed expert, stick around and keep
your eyes peeled for that video with Axel.
Again, if you're a premium subscriber to my substack, you'll be able to participate live
in that discussion with Axel will give us his thoughts and then we'll take live questions
from that premium audience.
So just one more reason to go to AdamTaggart.substack.com and upgrade.
Alright, folks, we're here at the end of the video and I got to rush off and grab a flight
to go to Lance Roberts's firm's conference that he's having this weekend in Houston.
Before I do, though, I just want to say look, if you've enjoyed this interview here with
Danielle and would like to see her come back on the program, please let me know and vote
your support for that by hitting the like button, then clicking on the red subscribe
button below, as well as that little bell icon right next to it.
Mike, thanks so much for joining me again for yet another week.
I'll let you have the last word here.
Well, thanks, it's been a great interview, Adam, I don't really have much to say in closing
other than we're watching the market carefully.
And if I had to guess, I'd say it goes a little higher for a little longer.
But you know, beware and we have protections on and again, happy to talk to anybody that
wants to talk.
Thanks again.
See you soon.
Thanks, Mike.
