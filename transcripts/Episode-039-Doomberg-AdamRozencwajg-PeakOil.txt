Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. A month ago, energy analyst
Doomburg published a report titled "Peak Cheap Oil is a Myth" and a few weeks back I interviewed him
about it. To say it ruffled feathers would be a huge understatement. Those in the peak cheap oil
camp have clamored for a chance to respond to Doomburg's claims and that's exactly what we're
going to do here in this video. Today, Adam Rosenzweig, managing partner of Gering and Rosenzweig,
natural resource investors, sits down for a discussion with Doomburg, which will be moderated
by yours truly to debate or better to co-explore the question, "When looking out at the next 50 years
is the threat of peak cheap oil fact or overblown fear?" Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us
today. Well, thank you so much for having me. I'm really excited to be here. Yeah, same here I must say.
Other than Corolla, I think I'm talking to two of my favorite Adams in the world so it's gonna be a
fantastic discussion. Alright, we'll have to get Adam Corolla on for the next one. Well, gentlemen,
thank you so much for joining me today. As I mentioned in the intro, a lot of interest was stirred
up by your recent report, Doomburg. When you and I had recorded our interview, we had noted
that there was probably going to be some response. There certainly was and we had talked about the
idea of maybe bringing on somebody who could argue basically the other side of the story and I
remember at the time you said, "Wow, my preference for that would be Adam Rosenzweig," and I think like
three or four hours after we said that, Adam actually reached out to you to say, "Hey, I'd actually
like to talk about this." So it seems like this discussion was written in the stars. Again, a lot
of people have been following this over the past couple of weeks. I'm so glad that you both agreed
to sit down with us today and actually hash through this. I've got a progression of questions
I'd like to try to get through but we'll let the conversation kind of go where it will.
My hope is at the end of it, the audience has a very clear understanding of the points upon which
you both agree and the areas in which you differ and where you differ, why you differ. So gentlemen,
without further ado, let's just jump right in and maybe we can do that by just defining for
the audience a few things. First off, what is peak cheap oil and why are those who are concerned
about it concerned about it? Adam, if we could start with you and let you just sort of set the
table here with that answer. No, that sounds great and look, I'm very excited to
be talking with both of you today. Doomburg, we read all of your writings. We've spoken on a
panel or two in the past as well and we think that your work is very, very good. It's always easier
to disagree with people that you don't admire their work than to have a different opinion when
you do admire their work but I think today it'll be exciting to go through some of the things that
we agree on and some of the things that we have a little bit of a different approach on because
ultimately there's a lot of overlap. There's a lot of commonality but I think our conclusions are
dramatically different so it should make for a really interesting discussion. When we talk about
peak oil and we talk about the end of peak cheap oil, what we're really talking about are the work
of King Hubbard and for those of you who are unaware, King Hubbard was a shell geologist who
was very prolific in the 1950s and he made some very controversial claims and both in his lifetime
and then even after his death, his views and his research were always mired in controversy so I
think it's very fitting that here we are today talking and debating about these same issues that
have been debated for quite some time. So I'm going to share my screen for a second here when
we talk about peak oil and peak cheap oil because what we're really talking about, as I mentioned,
are the works of King Hubbard and peak oil. There he is there and on the inset you'll see what
effectively was the culmination of a lot of his work and that was to tie together the concept of
reserves and production. Makes sense, it's simple on the face but the idea that your total peak
production rate of a field or of a given hydrocarbon basin would ultimately be determined by
how much recoverable reserve was there. The bigger the field, the more it could produce,
the higher the production rate and the longer it could sustain that rate and one of his views was
that once half the reserves of a field had been produced, the field would then peak in its
production and roll over and using these theories in these doctrines, King Hubbard got up in front
of a meeting of the American Petroleum Institute in the late 1950s and made the prediction that by
1970 US production, which to that point had been a big, big growth driver in global non-OPEC oil
production and global oil production since this predates OPEC, would peak in 1970. Very
controversial and so what happened, everyone waited with bated breath for the next 20 years or so and
sure enough, right on cue in 1971, oil production in the United States peaks and begins to roll
over and it rolls over all the way really until the late 2000s. By 2005, we saw another huge
resurgence in the views and the research of King Hubbard and peak oil and Hubbard's peak and this
type of stuff made famous by Matt Simmons who wrote Twilight in the Desert, made famous by the
oil drum and things of that nature and it was becoming a Wall Street kind of obsession and
favorite topic which should always make anybody a little bit nervous because no sooner than everyone
had sort of internalized peak oil than this happened. The United States production all of
a sudden started to grow. Not only did it grow, it surged. It went from about four and a half
million barrels all the way up to 13 million barrels that we have today. The most unbelievable
turnaround in the history of hydrocarbons and why? Well, of course, it's because of the shales
but what goes much less discussed is the idea that if you look only at conventional production
in the United States, meaning not shale production, you take out the shales, you'll see that in fact
for the last 12 years, post 2008, post 2009, US conventional production has continued to follow
its Hubbard's curve. It's continued to decline and decline and decline and what we've done is
we've filled in the shales right on top of that. Now, there's no taking away the importance and the
impacts of the shales in the last 15 years. They have been absolutely everything in global oil
markets but the real question I think before us today is here on the left you have the conventional
Hubbard peak for conventional US oil and on the right you have the shale production up until now
and the question is whether this will continue to grow, whether it will continue to provide
ample growth to meet global demand and to meet declines elsewhere or is what we're looking at
here the left-hand side of a secondary Hubbard curve? You treat almost the shales and the
conventional independently. That's what we're talking about when we talk about peak oil is
the idea of whether or not the shales will ultimately follow a lot of the same geological
constraints and considerations as the conventional oil production in the United States has and if it
does, does that mean that this major growth driver, in fact the only growth driver over the last 15
years is now potentially behind us and in that type of a world prices stay higher for longer.
We end up in a very, very tight energy market and I think you have a very, very strong bull run for
commodities and for energy going forward. Now, one thing we don't think peak oil and peak cheap oil
is and I just want to be clear on this, we're not inherently Malthusian, we're not Cassandras that
think the world is going to end and in fact there have been peak oil scares in the past and there
have been some have been right and some have been wrong, but ultimately I do think we resolve out
of these situations over a long enough time period. I don't think we're going to go back to living in
our pre-industrialized age, although Germany is trying to do that as we speak now, but what I do
think is that the era of abundant cheap energy that we've enjoyed for the last 15 years where
we brought on 13 million barrels a day effectively of unexpected production is not going to be
repeated in the next 15 or 20 years and I think that we're going to have a very, very tight market
because of that. Alright, and Dumerg, I'm going to give you a chance to respond in just a second.
A couple quick questions for you, Adam. First is I just want to underscore the point you just made.
You're not predicting in any sort of way like a Mad Max or a world made by hand kind of
dystopian future here where we kind of run out of energy. You're just saying that for the reasons
you just mentioned, supply is going to get increasingly marginally harder and more expensive
to extract and that, again, on the margin, oil will become more expensive as we go into the
future on average, correct? So we just have a little bit less available to us to drive our
economy as time goes on. Yeah, that's right and I think if you want to take one step back, so yes,
I think that's exactly right, Adam. I don't expect that we're going to go back to our Mad Max,
not that we ever were in a Mad Max post-apocalyptic world, but I don't think that
that's where we're headed. I think that our best days lie ahead of us and I think our most energy
abundant days lie ahead of us, but there's going to be major, major dislocation as we find ourselves
in an energy-constrained and an energy-tight world and I should point out everything in energy
markets is all set on the marginal unit of supply and demand. So when we talk about surpluses,
we're talking about a market that's never more than one percent in surplus and a deficit that
sees prices rise tenfold is never more than one or two percent in deficit. So everything's set on the
margin and I think on the margin in the last 15 years you can safely say you've been running into
additional supplies. It's been easier and easier and easier than anyone had expected in any given
moment to bring on new productive capacity and I think that's what's changing now. It's going to
become more and more and more and more difficult. So yes, the changes will feel subtle. They're not
going to run into a wall apocalyptically, but for investors, for consumers, the price action could
be quite dramatic. Alright, and then one last question before we get to you. I know
you're chomping at the bit. You talked about King Hubbard's peak oil theory where conventional
fields peak sort of on a bell curve. Then you showed how production took off when we tapped
into shale. Shale wells don't really decline on a gradual bell curve like that. They tend to decline
much more asymptotically. Is that accurate? So it is and it isn't. So yes, here you have some of the
earliest shale fields, the Barnett, which exhibits a very, very, very interesting bell-shaped curve,
much more than I think anyone had expected from a tight oil tight gas reserve, and the Fayetteville,
which is even more so. And I have a couple others in the Eagleford and the Bakken, which are a little
bit noisier, largely due to the effects of COVID. And here's the Permian. So the Permian is the big
wildcard. Will this end up looking like a bell-shaped curve or not? And I think that
that is one of the most fascinating peculiarities and subtleties here with the shales is that, yeah,
given the fact that they're completely different geologically, the fact that you're fracture
stimulating rock that effectively has no porosity and no permeability, and that you're introducing
artificial stimulation, you have these huge flush productions, and then they've declined 90%,
yet the fields seem to exhibit exactly the same tendencies as a conventional oil field well.
And I do think that that's one of the most interesting nuances that very, very few people
appreciate. So yeah, the shale wells are completely different. They have completely
different systems. They have different pathways and different matrix contributions to production.
And yet, there they are. They seem to, at least for the earliest ones that have now been in
production for about 10 or 12 years, generate a lot of the similar trends that the conventional
fields do. All right. Interesting. And I appreciate you clarifying that just because I know that some
of the peak oil folks say, yeah, we're having this party in the shale right now, but it's going to
disappear a lot faster because of the asymptotic nature. You're saying, well, so far looking at the
data, they seem to be following a similar bell curve. That's exactly right. Great. Thanks.
Duberg, you've been very patient here. Let me give you a chance to just respond to Adam's opening
there. You bet. And let me begin by reiterating what we said at the beginning. Very happy to be
here. I really love Adam's work and the G&R team, and I read everything they put out as well.
And I don't view today as the objective is to be right. The objective is to learn where the
differences lie and then let the audience decide in their own way where they think the world is
headed. So I would say that I agree with almost everything that Adam just said, but I would point
out a few inconvenient facts for the peak cheap oil crowd. And I would say that Adam's definition
of peak cheap oil is a little more reasonable than some of the hyperbole that we see out there
in the Twitter community in particular, and on some of the more less balanced YouTube channels
than your show, for example, Adam Taggart. Hubbard was largely correct about conventional
oil production in the US, and it did peak in 1970, 1971. And I would point out that integrated
across the world, the globe was producing 48 million barrels a day of oil in 1970. Now,
the US peaking in its production had huge ramifications for the world. The US ultimately
removed itself from the gold standard. I believe that the common belief in Washington DC that the
US had, in fact, irreversibly confronted peak oil led to many of the disastrous foreign adventures
that the country has embarked upon in the past 50 years. And another thing, the oil production
of the world has basically doubled since then. So Hubbard was completely right about US conventional
oil production. And yet on the larger picture, the picture that mattered to the global economy,
peak cheap oil was nowhere in sight. It is always the case that certain fields that are currently
being exploited that account for the totality or a significant portion of marginal production,
they will eventually roll over. No oil field is inexhaustible. But for the reasons we articulated
on our last appearance, Adam, I just think that you jump to the conclusion that an important
contributor to today's energy mix is possibly going to roll over, that this signals a meaningful
change in the long arc of oil production around the world, is an assumption that I think has
proven wrong for the past 50 years. And we see nothing on the immediate horizon that would make
us assume that would be the case today. One final data point, if you could pull up the inflation
adjusted price of oil chart that I sent you, Adam. As Adam Rosenzweig correctly mentioned,
the last time that we had such a mania around peak cheap oil and we reached the all-time high price,
both nominally and adjusted for inflation, was, in fact, at the beginning of the global financial
crisis. And since that time, we've added 20 million barrels a day of oil production and
a huge amount of natural gas production around the world. Nobody would argue that the global
financial crisis wasn't real, wasn't substantial, wasn't impactful, but measured over decades,
it was essentially meaningless in the overall global production of primary energy units.
And I would say that this chart that we've produced is very difficult for people in the
peak cheap oil crowd to explain away. This is the inflation adjusted price of oil using
the Bloomberg indices. And show me on the chart where peak cheap oil is being called
by the markets. Oil today is priced reasonably balanced. And I should say,
the inflation numbers used to create this chart are the official US government CPI statistics,
which I think many in the peak cheap oil community would argue radically understate the inflation
that we've all experienced. And so both can't be true, because if that's true, then oil is
even cheaper on an inflation adjusted basis than this chart shows. And this is a 40-year chart.
If we were truly on the edge of a tectonic shift in the production of primary energy,
I just don't think that we would be seeing the prices we're currently seeing.
Well, can I actually-- because I find that a really fascinating point and a couple of things
that I would be interested to respond to. If you look at that inflation adjusted oil price chart
again, the last time you had oil prices at these comparable levels was just as non-OPEC supply was
slowing in 2005. And you did have that big run up to which would nominally make it $145 a barrel oil.
And you did have major, major slowing in the non-OPEC oil supply base, which was saved really
only by the completely unexpected ramp up of the shales. And so, Bloomberg, as you and I have
talked about when we were chatting in the lead up to this call, I think always and forever in energy
markets, the key is to be looking sort of-- trying your best to look around the next corner and see
where the next potential source of new supply will be. Because clearly, in our mind, we could
talk all about the shales at great length. We've done a lot of work on the shales. I think the
shales continue to be extremely misunderstood by many people in the market. And a good example of
that is that most people now are talking about this surging supply in the fourth quarter of last
year from the shales. It's just not in the data. I don't know where people are getting their numbers
from. It's just, frankly, not in any of the official or in the well by well or in the public
company data. So the shales continue to be really misunderstood. But you go back to 1970 and you go
back to 2005. And there was a huge amount of ingenuity. There's a huge amount of engineering
prowess being put to work in the oil patch. And yet that didn't stop oil prices from 1970,
effectively going up 11 fold from $3 to $35. And in 2000 to 2005, going from $11 to $145,
there was a huge amount of effort looking for the next field. There's a huge amount of effort
trying to develop new production to, as you said, counteract the depletion of a major
source of existing supply. But in 1970, it wasn't enough to overcome the slowing of the major source
of Western world oil supply, which was the United States, and nothing could really overcome that.
And that's why prices ended up rallying 11 fold. And in 2005, as the non-OPEC block in general was
beginning to slow, prices again started to move up again on a factor of about 10 as OPEC began
to gain pricing power and market share. Since 2010, there's been no such tensions at all.
Because as you rightly mentioned, the US has basically brought on, when you include NGLs,
which I know is a whole other point in this conversation, you basically brought on 20
million barrels of oil from the shale. So we have been running into oil for the last 15 years.
And that's why prices have been weak. And that's why prices, as you rightly point out on an
inflation-adjusted basis, remain weak. But if we start to get that first derivative inflection,
where the rate of change of the growth begins to turn negative, production peaks and rolls over in
the shales, the only source of growth, I think that that begins to undo that. OPEC begins to
gain market share pricing power. And you have a totally new regime until you bring on a new
source of supply, which right now is unclear where it'll come from. And Adam, if I may, I agree with
almost everything you just said. And I think this is an important point to draw out. The crises that
followed the peaking of US production in the 1970s or the crises that led to the global financial
crisis in the mid to mid to late 2000s were not episodes of peak cheap oil. They were precursors
to a period of relative energy shortage that led to massive moves in the price of oil. And if that
were to happen today, which we freely admit is entirely possible, our argument is that would
not constitute peak cheap oil. It would constitute a temporary crisis of energy shortage that would
very quickly, as it has always done, be corrected, initially by destruction of demand and economic
contraction, but eventually by the deployment of new technology, the loosening of politics,
the widening of the definition of oil, and so on, such that the long-term price of oil
will regress to the historical mean. And so I don't think we're actually disagreeing on the main
point. I readily admit that we are currently in a period of relative energy excess driven
predominantly by marginal production in the shale patch. And if that were to change in a time frame
that makes it difficult for the rest of the world to step up supply or to wipe away political
constraints or to implement new technologies, we would certainly be in a multi-year energy bull
market. But our view is that is very far away from calling the long-term top of peak cheap oil.
And our prediction is by 2040, we will be producing meaningfully more oil than we are today.
The path function from here to there might be rocky. Some people might make a lot of money,
some people might lose a lot of money. But the long arc of the human endeavor is we grind out
more primary energy every year, not less. And we see nothing on the horizon that would substantially
change that. And final point is if we were having this discussion in 2008 during the mania,
the Simmons famous bet that we described in our piece, none of us would have any idea that shale
was on the horizon and would have the impact that it did, which basically just says we don't know
what it will be that saves humanity from peak cheap oil. But it'll be something we have some
thoughts which we can get into. But I would say, sure, we could have a meaningful crisis. And I
guess it comes down to a matter of degree. How big of a crisis would we need to see in the next,
say, two to three years for the Bloomberg side to tip the hat and say, yep, for practical purpose,
we were we were wrong in our analysis or vice versa, like how small a crisis would the peak
cheap oil crowd have to see before production rebounded in a variety of ways before they would
say, yeah, okay, maybe we've still got 20, 30, 40, 50 years to go on this incredible journey?
Well, and I suppose, you know, that's where ultimately we find our greatest point of
overlap and our greatest point of divergence. I also believe that human ingenuity and engineers
will find a way through this and we'll, our best days lie ahead of us from both an energy
consumption perspective, and from a GDP and economic development perspective. I suppose
using the past cycles as a interesting point of reference in history. If you can, if you think,
you know, you take the minus $40 print that we had in the heart of COVID, you call $20 a reasonable
low for this cycle. And your 27 was the low made in 16. And then you basically had a couple months
of 20 bucks through COVID as well. So let's call 20 the cycle low. And if you rose 11 fold off of
20 to $220 in this cycle, because of a supply issue, and the inability to meaningfully bring
on new production to be able to meet global demand growth, and or a period of curtailment from OPEC,
because of their feeling that they had retained pricing power and market share, I would consider
that an energy tight market, I would consider that a market of which we are not a wash in oil,
which we're not readily running into new supplies. And whether or not you ring the bell and call it
the top of peak cheap oil, I think with crude at $200, there's probably a little victory lap that
comes from the folks that we're calling for some type of a peak oil. And this is where definitions
can get confounded and mixed up. And to some extent, it makes all the difference is how you
define these things. And to some extent, you know, it's a little bit like you know it when you see
it. So I think if we get if we get a price spike, if we move forward, if there's a feeling that it's
very difficult to bring on the marginal barrel of supply, if inventories continue to trend lower,
then I do think that that the peak cheap oil people, at least the more moderates,
could put a little feather in their cap 50 years from now, I bet we are producing, we're certainly
producing more energy of that I have absolutely no doubt, I tend to think we're probably going
to be producing more oil as well, mostly because it's the most efficient form of absent nuclear
of energy that we can meaningfully harness and and use. And so yeah, I think that prices will
send the right signal, I think that engineers will do their thing. And I think we'll probably
will resolve in 30 years from now with production, I would suspect a little bit higher than we are
today. Let me let me clarify a couple of things. But let me let me dig into that point you just
made for a second, Adam. So if if we're talking about peak cheap oil, but you're kind of agreeing
that in 50 years or so for using that as the timeline here, that we're going to be producing
more oil. And you know, you've said our better days are ahead of us. How worried are you about
that? I think a lot of people are gonna say, Well, wait a minute, I was kind of thinking we'd have
less oil, or at least, you know, much more expensive oil, and that would be shrinking GDP,
or at least preventing GDP from from rising much. Well, I do think it's gonna be but I do think it's
gonna be much more expensive. And I think if you look at right now, with the resource in the reserve
of the world is today, it doesn't immediately jump out at you where you're going to boost production
above where we are today at 102 million barrels per day, maybe you get to 103, 104, 105. But
absent major new discoveries of which we have had scant few over the last 10 or 15 years, and absent
the exporting of the US shale technologies to the rest of the world, which is a wonderful point that
I think we need to discuss at length, it doesn't really immediately jump out, you can't put your
finger and say, Okay, I see exactly here, the pathway to where we're going to get to 120. Does
that mean you can't get to 120 barrels a day? Absolutely not. However, it probably does mean
that you need to use the price mechanism to incentivize new investment and a new price
cycle coming. And in that environment, you know, particularly as investors in that environment,
that's effectively what we're looking for. I'm and I'm a total optimist. Yeah, I don't think you can
be an investor in equities without being a long term optimist. Certainly history is not on your
side if you're not a long term optimist. And I think our best days are ahead of us because we're
going to continue as Bloomberg said, to grind out year after year, additional sources of energy,
whether they're cheap, whether they're expensive remains to be seen. And I think it's going to be
put towards productive economic output, because at the end of the day, GDP is effectively just
a different way of talking about energy. And so do you think you're going to produce more energy
going forward? Well, that asks, do you think the world is going to grow? And I think, of course,
the world will continue to grow, it's going to be harder and harder to find oil on the marginal
barrel of supply versus demand. I think things are looking tough. And I think unfortunately,
in this cycle, what I do, what I am a little bit pessimistic about is that I do think, when I look
at what's going to end a bull run in crude, which is something I think is very important to look at
any commodity that we look at, I don't think it's going to be, as of right now, new supply that
comes on and overwhelms this market. I think it's going to be demand destruction. I think it's going
to be high prices that squeeze out the incremental barrel of demand for this cycle. And so I think
that there's a period of time here where we need to work through, I think there's a period of time
where prices move a lot higher. And I think there's a period of time where investors are
going to be rewarded amply and richly for being involved in energy stocks, and particularly oil
stocks. All right, great. And again, I'm just trying to zero in on really where the points of
difference are here. Because I believe both you think there are cycles here where, over the next
couple of decades, there's going to be price spikes, there's going to be lows in price as well.
Doomburg, if I remember correctly from our previous interview, you basically said over
the next 50 years, you sort of expect oil supply to increase on average about 2% a year. And that
it would, on average, sort of remain in the inflation-adjusted price band that we currently
are in right now. You don't see like a secularly higher real price of oil as we head off into the
future. Adam, I think that's where you disagree. It sounds like you think that on a real inflation
basis, adjusted basis, the price of oil is going to grind higher. How about to Doomburg's 2% per
annum supply prediction? Can I just give one point of reference here? It's probably integrated across
oil and natural gas. Natural gas is growing at 2.5% CAGR since 1998, almost in a straight line,
and oil is probably closer to between 1 and 1.5. But integrated over the hydrocarbons,
we are grinding out about 2% a year. So before Adam jumped in, I just wanted to make sure that
I clarified the numerical references I was making in my own head last time we talked, Adam.
Great. Thanks. And I want to get in a second to just sort of make sure we agree on the definition
of what is oil because Doomburg, I know you have a bit of a different descriptor of it than maybe
a lot of the peak oil folks do. But Adam, did I describe it correctly where you differ on kind
of the price direction, obviously? Do you think his supply prediction is -- because 2% per annum
compounds over 50 years. Do you think that's too rosy or do you think you guys more aligned there
than maybe I imagined? I think looking at it right now that might be a little bit rosy. With the
caveat just like Doomburg puts out his caveat that we're only a geopolitical event away from a crisis,
I would put out the caveat that it's difficult to try to look around the corner to find the next
undiscovered potential field. But as of right now, it looks as though we're going to enter into 2024
with likely declines across the shale basins, likely declines in the rest of the non-OPEC world.
And so if I'm looking at the market for the next five to 10 years, which is sort of our investment
time horizon, the main source of new supply is probably going to be the deep water. And can the
deep water provide 2 million barrels per day per year of net growth in order to hit that 2% number?
That seemed high to me. And I know they're making distinctions between natural gas and oil,
but actually we think that a lot of the depletion that's taking place in crude oil is actually
taking place in natural gas as well, which is even a more controversial comment. Because even
the peak oil guys think we have as much gas as we need, but we're not so sure. So I think 2%
is probably too rosy based on how we see things now. So Adam, can I respond to a couple of the
points that Adam has made? Absolutely. Just to let you guys know, what I do want to get to
relatively soon is your outlooks for supply and demand. But before we get to there,
I do want you to give your definition of what oil is. Doomburg, just in case if Adam has a
difference of opinion, we can get that on the table first too. But yes, go respond away.
A quick response to the last couple of points that Adam has made about where the new supply
is going to come from. And then we could shift to the definition of oil and its uses and how
there are other alternatives that smart engineers will implement in the face of $200 oil. I will say
I think $200 oil in the next five years is totally possible. And I just don't think that would mark
peak cheap oil. But where would the price of oil be today if we weren't engaged in a proxy war with
the world's most important energy exporter, Russia? Where would the price of oil be today
if we didn't have a kinetic conflict that we are basically directly involved in,
in the heart of the Middle East? Where would the price of oil be today if Venezuela hadn't lost
3 million barrels a day of production because of political chaos? I don't think anybody would argue
that the decline in Venezuelan oil production has anything to do with geology.
Where would the price of oil be if the discovery of oil offshore in Guyana was used as a catalyst
to develop a more productive relationship with Venezuela in a way that allowed Guyana's resources
to be developed and Venezuela's resources to recover? We could talk about Mexico. We could
talk about political leadership changes in Canada, leading to perhaps further exploitation of the tar
sands in Alberta. Where would the price of oil be if OPEC hadn't voluntarily cut 2 million barrels
a day of production? Where will the price of oil be if the shale resources in Russia and Argentina
and even China eventually get properly exploited? I think there's all manner of relatively low
barrier changes to the way the world currently operates that could very well bridge us for the
next 5 to 10 years, even in the face of a relatively unexpected slowdown in the shale
patch. That's our base case. If you want, I could pivot to what we think oil should be defined as,
but maybe you could set it up with a question first.
Duberg, I just want to say one thing to that because I find that's a fascinating set of
comments. I agree with you that when you do look through 2023 and into 2024, I do agree that I
would have expected a dust-up in Europe and a major conflict in the Middle East. Dust-up is
obviously a bit of a glib term, but major kinetic war in both continental Europe and in the Middle
East to have elicited a higher price, and I do find that a little bit curious to say the least.
When I look at some of the releases from the SPR through 2022-2023, I think I can understand some
of what was being glossed over with the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and I think just the
unbelievable bearish sentiment in the fourth quarter, but the problem with counterfactuals
is that they're kind of difficult to argue against and they're kind of difficult to see the other
side of, and so what I would propose back to you is where would oil prices be if we hadn't brought
on nearly 20 million barrels of unexpected new supply, 20% of global oil production from the U.S.
back in 2010? I mean, no one had that in their models. George Mitchell and Mitchell Energy was
sort of down to his last dollar, having gone broke, trying and trying and trying in a way that
only American ingenuity allows for, and finally in sort of his last gasp effort was able to make
horizontal drilling and hydrological fracturing work, and yet here we are today still with oil
basically in its long term, as you mentioned, inflation-adjusted range. What happens if we
lose that source of growth, which I believe is very, very likely based on the reserves of these
massive fields that have been huge contributors but are ultimately finite in nature? And the same
thing is true in gas. I mean, gas is just astounding when you kind of think of the counterfactual.
I remember back in 2009, and this may be a good segue into talking about what makes for oil and
different forms of hydrocarbons, but all the way back in 2009, we had Wood Mac in our office,
their big energy consultant firm, and they were talking about the LNG market. We were really
bullish on LNG, and they were super bearish on LNG at the time, and the reason they were so bearish
on LNG was that Qatar was about to ramp up their major new RAS gas 3 or RAS gas 4, whatever it was.
This could be a huge new source of LNG onto the world stage, and it was going to massively,
massively overwhelm supply-demand balances, and prices would fall effectively to zero,
to the marginal cost of supply, which was Qatari gas, effectively free feedstock,
and just the cost to ship it. This was such a pervasive view that, of course, the United States
actually built a massive import terminal to try to soak up all this free gas that would be floating
on the water come summertime, because we were the only country in the world that had salt dome
storages. So how could you measure whether gas LNG on the water is cheap or not? The conventional
wisdom is you look at its parity to crude oil, 6 to 1 plus transportation. If it holds its oil
link price, that's a view that the LNG market's pretty tight, it's trading up to its oil premium.
Otherwise, if it's a wash, then it'll break that price. So from 2010, what has happened? Well,
not only did all the Qatari gas come on, not only did they double expand their LNG exports,
but the world's biggest importer, the United States, became the world's biggest exporter.
So you had a double order of magnitude swing. The world's biggest importer shut off, and a new
world's biggest exporter was crowned. And yet LNG over that entire time held its oil link price.
There's a few exceptions based on whether, but for the most part, and here we are today, continues
to hold its LNG price. And so some of these counterfactuals are a little bit difficult. Like
where would LNG prices be if the United States was still importing 6 or 7 BCF a day instead of
exporting 13 or 14? That's the huge contribution that these shells have brought to the world.
And the fact that they're potentially beginning to slow, I think, has to be -- if the shells were the
most important oil story of the last 15 years, the slowing of the shale, I worry, will be the
most important oil story and gas story of the next. All right. Well, that raises, again, some supply
questions that I want to get to in terms of your outlooks, one being the shale basins that you're
largely referencing there, Adam, are ones in the US. So one big question is, are there geologies
elsewhere in the world that could potentially be exploited? Before we get to that, Doomburg,
because I just want to make sure that you guys are agreeing when you say the word oil.
Doomburg, can you give your definition of oil, and Adam, if you want to react to that in any way,
that'd be great. So I think this is an important point, and one that I think ruffled a few
feathers, and a few loud voices out there are misconstruing what we said, and certainly what we
meant when we said it on your show, perhaps having not read what we actually wrote in our pieces.
And one of the sayings that we have around here is, we're always happy to defend what we wrote,
but not what you think you read, because sometimes, amazingly, they can be very different things.
If you want to understand what the proper definition of oil is, the first thing you
have to understand is, what is it used for? And in the vast majority of use cases,
setting aside the six or seven percent that is transformed into chemicals, oil is burned in
engines to do work. That's a very broad definition of oil, and right now, the world has billions of
machines and engines that burn oil to do work, and those machines are tuned to receive certain
refined products. So a diesel engine can't run on gasoline, and a gasoline engine can't
run on diesel and so on. And so our refinery network, the Global Refinery Network, its job
is to convert hydrocarbons into those well-specified products. And so for today, our definition of oil
is any hydrocarbon that finds its way into a refinery. And I think as refineries become
more flexible, chemists and chemical engineers work their magic. When feedstocks are abundant,
because no refinery could really use them, inventions and investments are made in order to
close that molecular arbitrage. If heavy oil is plentiful, what you see is refineries invest in
sulfur removal technologies where they might not have had to do so before because they were
built to handle light, sweet, crude, and so on. And over time, as refineries become more flexible,
the variety of hydrocarbons that can find their way in, either directly or through blending,
to displace what traditional crude oil had provided the market, the definition of oil
necessarily must run. And so it's interesting that Adam bifurcated the conventional oil and
the shale oil as though they were meaningfully different. But I would argue that as refineries
become more flexible and can adapt to the molecular arbitrage on offer, as abundant
feedstocks are cheap and feedstocks everyone can already refine today get more expensive,
those things tend to converge over time. Now over the long run, we have a whole other
handle we could pull, which is something we're publishing on tomorrow, which will be out before
this podcast publishes I suspect, which is you could just change the engines. And in fact,
you could run most of the engines on natural gas directly. We could run cars on natural gas,
we could run long haul trucks, we could run mining equipment, ag equipment, we can even run
cargo shipping vessels on natural gas if we had to. Now that would involve
some financial investment. But as long as natural gas is cheaper than refined products,
you could skip the refinery step and just use natural gas directly. And in the US where we
have an unexpected glut at $2.35 as we're recording this podcast per million BTU,
I mean, a million BTU natural gas in the US costs less than a six pack of nuggets at McDonald's,
it would get put to use. People would change their engines and run their cars and their trucks
on natural gas in a true crisis if we did see $250, $300, $500 oil, like some people predict.
The more violent the crisis in our view, the quicker the snapback. And that means that in
the longest of long terms, all hydrocarbons will be oiled and they will effectively trade for the
same price. That is the ultimate end point of the deflationary machine that is modern technology.
>> All right. That is a pretty bold stake in the ground in terms of what oil is. I'm curious,
Adam, do you agree, strongly disagree? What's your reaction?
>> No, it's funny. I don't find it to be that bold of a commentary at all. I mean, to the extent
nobody consumes crude oil in an explicit sense, I suppose, other than if you're a finery, but when
somebody says, okay, Doomburg, okay, Adam, what's your per capita oil consumption? I mean, I don't
know what you guys are doing with it, but for the most part, what you're consuming is vehicle miles
traveled in a car. And so I completely agree that what we're looking at is the inherent energy
in any of these fuels. And there are certain physical properties, like the fact that
crude oil, typically considered crude oil, liquid crude oil, has a certain amount of methane,
a certain amount of various other hydrocarbons and tends to be a liquid of a various range of
viscosities at room temperature. But other than that, what we're really getting after is the
underlying energy that's contained in it. To some extent, I think it's a little bit of a moot point
because you do need to consider all the various sources of energy. And I don't think that we look
at oil in a complete isolation from natural gas. And in fact, a lot of the trends that we see
taking place and sort of peaking out of shale resources and crude oil is actually also taking
place in gas. And actually, if you really want to look at it, the two fields that have had the
biggest, most pronounced, Hubbard-style rollovers have been shale gas fields, not shale oil fields.
So they're definitely subject to the same limitations. Now, one distinction, though,
that I think is really important to make is that while we have a degree of flexibility and while we
can change crude slates or we can add byproducts or we can start to strip out NGLs from liquids-rich
streams and begin to reprocess them, and the refining system is this unbelievable optimizer
that kind of sits in the middle of the value chain and of the supply chain. While that's all true,
I think we effectively need to, or at least you can, Doomburg, agree or disagree with me that
there's kind of two distinctions here in my mind, because I was thinking about it as you were
talking, how to really frame this. The one would be, if we ran into a new source of hydrocarbon,
let's say we found a new shale oil field or a new shale gas field, and it had various properties
that were not exactly consistent or conforming with the current refining slate and the refining
complexities, meaning the refiners couldn't easily take that new source of oil or that new source of
gas. Well, ultimately, what that would do over a fairly short term, we can argue what the exact
short term is, but a fairly short term, what you would end up with was a system in which that new
source of energy, which was very, very efficient, because it's a new virgin field producing at
really flush rates, would find its way into the system through tweaks and through engineering
changes to allow for that. And ultimately, it probably would end up in greater than trend
economic growth to effectively use that new source of energy. That would be kind of one side of the
equation, and I think that's kind of the world that you're envisioning here, where we're broadening
our scope, engineering acumen is allowing us to now treat NGLs, gas, oil as not quite fungible,
but nearly fungible, and that, as you put it, at the end of this deflationary path, you'll have
complete energy parity, because we'll have abundance throughout the different supply chains
and the ability to go back and forth. And I would say you've got to compare and contrast that with
actually a lot of the historical precedent of things like gas to liquids. And as we have
discussed in the past, gas to liquids was really engineered first in Germany during World War II as
a solution to get around the fact that they didn't have ready available supplies of crude oil to make
for aviation fuel. And then secondly, in South Africa as an attempt to get around apartheid state
sanctions and inabilities to access global energy markets from a crude basis. And in that case,
what you're doing is you're turning, in the case of South Africa, coal, but you could turn natural
gas or coal into a synthetic gasoline. So that kind of fits your bill too, right, that over time,
we'll be able to get what we need through the system. But that's inherently done from a position
of scarcity, because you have to with very poor energy efficiency and very poor energetics,
versus we're running into huge new supplies of feedstock, we're awash in a new super light
condensate. And so we're going to change the slates to be able to accommodate that.
I see us more going in the first example that I gave, the sort of Germany, South Africa example,
where we're coming at it from a position of supply scarcity, and we do what we have to do to get what
we need. But to me, that's inherently inflationary, as opposed to, I think, your view of the world,
where we have this expanded view, because we're just awash in everything, and we need the
flexibility to go back and forth. And we have a culmination of a deflationary event in energy.
So I think the logic's the same. But again, the outcome's really, really different, because I just
don't think that we're running into molecules anymore. So let me give you a standard debate
tactic, which is a yes, and. So I actually agree with everything that you said. And those two
examples from history are instructive, because they do identify what we would do if situations
got bad enough, and the technology exists, and we have continued to perfect it over time. I would
argue what Shell is doing at the Pearl GTL plant is different than what the Nazis were doing in
World War II, out of necessity. But we have an even more recent example, which I think is very
instructive as to what, quote unquote, we would do if your predictions in the Shell patch and in the
US do pan out. And it's the European energy crisis of '21 and '22. And what did they do?
They scoured the world for every molecule of energy they could get their hands on,
regardless of carbon footprint, regardless of price, and regardless of impact on
emerging markets. And in fact, Germany retreated to using coal on a massive scale
to buttress the worst impacts, to shave the worst risks off the energy crisis. And I think the US
would do much the same. I think the US would limit exports of all manner of refined products and LNG.
I think we would quickly ramp back up coal production and the use of coal to produce
electricity to offset natural gas that would be otherwise used for those efforts. I think
this gets to the second category of why we think the repertoire of responses available to humanity
to the development of a temporary period of relative energy shortage would involve a wiping
away of politics. Look, there's strong support for coal in the US. There's huge controversy about its
phase out, even if it's being replaced with natural gas. And I think a lot of that would get
wiped away if we did see 200, 250 dollar oil and the inevitable recession that would follow.
And so I think the European example, and look, this is Germany, the global capital of the green
energy transition, because of one year's worth of crisis, where oil leaped to 130 dollars a barrel,
roughly, but most importantly, natural gas hit unbelievable numbers, tenfold type numbers,
like Adam explained earlier, is possible. $100 per million BTU natural gas in Europe,
intraday high at the top, really remarkable. But what did they do? They suffered economically,
and they still are through their own, I think, idiotic policies. But they immediately
wiped away political constraints to getting their hands on any hydrocarbon that would work. And as
I think we both agree, it doesn't take but two to three million barrels either way to swing the
market violently from negative $27 a barrel to $130 a barrel, like we saw during the COVID
emergency and the era that followed. And so I think there are things we would do. We wouldn't
need to do them at scale. If we did five million barrels a day of GTL, that would probably buy us a
decade. If we got serious about developing all the conventional resources, like I talked about
earlier, that really are just inherently constrained by politics, I think $200 a barrel
oil would wipe away those political constraints. And so humans have an amazing way to regress to
the mean. And the production of energy resources like oil and natural gas and NGLs and condensates
and even coal is an upward sloping curve with a bit of a sine wave to it.
Well, look, I think, again, on so many of these details, I agree totally. But I guess in some,
it's the perspective and it's the conclusion that I reach is a little bit different. So if oil
prices went to $200 and the United States feared a normalization of its US gas price, natural gas
price with world prices, which then subjected an export ban on LNG, leading to effectively a pretty
tough spot for most NATO countries who have come to rely on a US LNG backstop to offset Russian
production, thereby exporting what we're seeing here in the United States to the rest of the world.
I would call that pretty pessimistic and kind of in my vein of what I would worry about for
an energy crisis in the next five years. So if coming out of the back of that, we end up with
low energy prices again, I don't know that I would consider that a defeat on my, if we're making our
hypothetical Matt Simmons style bet, particularly because as you and I will find something else to
agree on, when we go down the path and we look ultimately 20 and 30 years out, I think we both
agree on the unbelievable high efficiency and low carbon footprint of nuclear power and uranium.
And so I think we all know where we need to get eventually. And that's why ultimately I am quite
optimistic and bullish long-term. I think our best days do lie ahead of us because
if you look through human history, there was two major inflection points in human history, and
both of them corresponded to a step change in energy efficiency. The first is when we went from
sort of hunting and gathering to domesticated farm life. And that was commensurate, give or
take a couple of thousand years with the written word and civilization as we know it. And then the
second was civilization was basically static for the next three plus thousand years until we move
from that grain-based diet and using animal locomotion to burning coal and using fossil
fuels. And we went from an EROI five to one to 30 to one. Well, with nuclear, we could go to 101 or
180 to one on some of the USMRs. And so I think that really, I'm hyper bullish if you really kind
of coax me out of it in the long term, because I think that what this energy crisis is beginning
to elicit is a proper appreciation for the benefits of nuclear power. And if that's what
comes of all this, and if you chalk up renewables and EVs and a lot of the nonsense that we've had
in the last 10 years to the cost of doing business to ultimately getting us to a nuclear future,
then I think it's all well worth it. And I do think that the best, most prolific days lie ahead.
Adam, can I ask a question on that? Because this is where I was going to get to around your demand
outlook. What kind of probability do you put on advances in other forms of energy that may
reduce the world's need for fossil fuels going forward? So let's say we go into a nuclear
renaissance, and we do end up electrifying a much greater percentage of the transportation
system. So we just need fewer fossil fuels to power it going forward. Could that essentially
push off your concerns about peak cheap oil until the next 100 years?
Well, look, so let me take a big step back, because this could fill a whole podcast in
and of itself. And I want to be concise. I want to let Bloomberg have some time,
and I want to be able to talk about some other things here as well that you find
interesting and germane. So we look at everything through the lens of EROI, or Energy Return on
Investment. How much energy do you get out for every unit you put in? And all of human history
has been a massive unidirectional push towards things that have higher and higher and higher EROIs.
We started out, as I mentioned, hunting and gathering, then we dealt with grain-based,
domesticated crops and farm life, and then we moved to coal, and then ultimately to oil,
natural gas, and then finally to nuclear power in the second half of last century.
We can't move towards something that has inferior energetics. Renewables have inferior energetics.
We're never going to move towards them. That's why this push has been so painful.
If they were really much more efficient, we would have readily adopted them. If the windmill was the
answer to our problems, it would have been adopted when Don Quixote was fighting the windmills. It
would not have to be in 2024 such as it is, and it's still a painful experience because the
energetics don't work. The only thing where the energetics do work is nuclear. Nuclear is off
the charts. Everything else in the thermal, when you're looking at chemical energy and releasing
energy by breaking bonds of hydrocarbons or anything else for that matter, the only thing
that beats that is nuclear power. So if we can go down the nuclear road, you can electrify anything
you want. The EV by the time you build its battery and you power it with renewables doesn't make a
lick of sense. It's terrible energy efficiency. It emits more CO2 than if you just burnt the gasoline
in the first place. If we want to go to an all nuclear world, have at it. That is by far the
most efficient and cleanest, but the most efficient, most importantly, form of energy we've ever come
to know, and you can do dumb things with it. You could have nuclear power plants that made hydrogen
to run in airplanes if you really wanted to. So yeah, if we moved to 100% of a nuclear world,
then I think that you could conceivably begin to wean yourself off of fossil fuels and hydrocarbons.
And I would frankly be the first in line to buy a ticket to see that show because I think it would
be just fabulous. So 100% agreement, obviously, on our part. Everything Adam just said, we would
wholeheartedly agree on and we would stand in line right behind him to buy that ticket. I will just
have one nuance to that statement, which is even in that scenario, all primary energy production
is additive and we would still produce more oil, more natural gas and more coal than we do today,
because not all of the world is ready to receive and operate nuclear power facilities.
They're very sophisticated to build, operate and maintain safely. And we don't necessarily want
all the world to be in possession of this technology for national security concerns,
but all the world does want to develop. And your standard of living is defined by how much energy
you get to harvest. And in a world where the West, US, G7, G20 countries have proliferated
nuclear power to the extent that both Adam and I wish they would, there's five to six billion
people who would greedily, happily, readily consume the incremental barrel of oil, natural gas
and ton of coal, thus freed up. And I think even if you look at the renewables contribution as
inefficient and uneconomic as they are, the arc of history is the total primary energy consumed
by humans always goes up. There's an infinite demand for private energy at reasonable prices.
And in a world where we did proliferate nuclear power, that would have a temporary dampening
effect on the price of oil, gas and coal, which would then create new demand for it in the
developing world who are desperate to raise their standard of living to something we would consider
even recognizable. Yeah, I think that's a wonderful point. And I think that it gets to this idea of
what is energy and its relationship with the economy. I mean, to me, energy is the economy.
There's nothing that we do in our world that doesn't use energy to transform some material
from one form to another, or move some good someplace to another, or move some person
someplace to another. So the entire system that we live in is nothing but a giant energy conversion
apparatus and machine. And to the same extent that there's no upper bound on where we would accept
per capita GDP, we would always take more, I think that there's absolutely no upper bound. So you're
probably right. If you had almost unlimited, incredibly efficient energy coming from nuclear
power, you probably would consume that and the oil and the coal and the gas, up until you exhausted
all. So you're probably right about that. Obviously, the other thing is being a little
bit facetious. I said if the world all goes 100% nuclear, then you could get rid of hydrocarbons
and get rid of your cars. I mean, I think if you did not invest in oil and gas on the
hypothesis that we were going to go 100% nuclear and drive electric vehicles on 100% nuclear
power load, you would miss quite a bit of an investment cycle in between. So obviously,
I say that a little bit tongue-in-cheek. All right, well look, we're coming up on the hour,
Marc, here. Gentlemen, I will go as long as you want to go here, and I want to make sure we talk
about whatever topics are important to you that we haven't yet. I'm going to ask maybe my last major
question and let you guys just drive how you want to wrap this up, or where you want to take it
before we wrap it up. But if I can, I just want to get to your outlooks for supply going forward.
Doomburg, if I sort of understand your perspective well, it's that there are a couple of factors that
you factor into why supply could go up in the future. One is you talk about expanding our
definition of what the oil feedstock is, and obviously new technologies will continue to help
play a role in expanding that and accelerating that. The second is that there's the potential
for new development and potentially hopefully new discoveries of energy deposits around the world.
We haven't really talked about all that much yet in this conversation. And then the third is,
we get to a point that you made in our discussion earlier, Doomburg, that it's much easier
to remove a political constraint than a geological constraint, and that there's lots of oil out there
that we know of that we're just not tapping yet for a whole host of different political or
geopolitical reasons. And in a crisis, if I understand your logic correctly, you think that
we'll become much more amenable to tapping those resources so we could potentially
sort of change the availability game and supply pretty quickly if we all of a sudden say that
we'll have got together and said, "Hey, let's help Venezuela really tap their resources." It's just
one example. So if maybe, Doomburg, we could start with you with, A, did I summarize that well,
and B, just going to give a sense of your outlook here because I want to see if you
guys agree that there is indeed enough oil that could come out of the ground here if we do these
things right, or if you actually have difference of opinions on actually how much oil is out there
to tap going forward. So I would say, first of all, thank you. It's been a wonderful discussion,
a real honor to be invited to participate in it, and you have mostly accurately reflected our view.
I would add the following. We often say, and I think Adam would agree with this, that the single
most important question you have to ask yourself about whatever economy that you're analyzing is,
is that economy currently in a period of relative energy abundance or deficit?
And the answer to that question drives significant influences on the answer to all other questions
about the economy because I agree with Adam that ultimately GDP is just an expression of how much
energy you are producing and how efficiently you are translating that energy into increased
standard of living. To the descriptor of what we would do if we were to pivot from what I believe
today is a period of relative energy abundance, I think it's pretty undeniable with natural gas in
the U.S. at two and change and LNG at eight and a half and coal at 125 and oil in the low 70s,
despite all of the geopolitical risk premium that's undoubtedly baked into those prices,
that the world is at worst balanced but most likely in a period of relative energy abundance.
If we pivot to a temporary period of energy deficit, the cost curve of implementation options
include all manner of things, including developing resources that we know exist that are trapped by
politics, including putting a ceiling on the equilibrium price of oil by building out
all different manner of ways to use natural gas around the world to substitute either directly
or indirectly for the reasons we use oil. And then the last point I'd make that we haven't
talked about yet, as we alluded to heading into the 2010s, nobody would have had the impact of
shale on the horizon. And it's an interesting question sitting here today. What could that be
in the next 10 years? And we would argue one possibility is relieving this most recent energy
crisis with a far more efficient global supply chain network for the exploration, exploitation
and use of natural gas. We're in two to three years, we're going to be able to ship natural
gas to and from far flung places around the globe that would have seemed inconceivable before the
European energy crisis. And as Adam correctly said, I'm old enough to remember when Freeport LNG was
an import terminal and how quickly have we turned the tables? And we would argue that we would be
just as quick at turning the tables in the face of an energy crisis. So to your question, we are
currently in a period of relative energy abundance. If that were to change, there's a menu of options
with a cost associated with each of those options and a thickness of the wedge that could temporarily
bridge the gap until the next technology miracle inevitably comes around the corner. And I don't
know if it's from the proliferation of AI across the oil majors or some political... The great reset
after the fourth turning leads to a world that collaborates far more efficiently with less
friction on energy. And so who knows? But it is always and forever the direction of the world that
we produce more primary energy and we exploit it for the betterment of humanity. And I choose to
live in a world where that continues. Great. Well, Bloomberg, I think that we should have a Neil Howe
fourth turning podcast on a regular basis because I think we might either do well by that or we
would quickly have you fall from number one down to number something else. But I'm glad to see
you're a big fourth turning fan as well as are we here at GNR. So look, I think that the biggest
single event that's happened to global energy markets in the last arguably 100 years and
certainly in the last 20 years has been the unexpected introduction of nearly 13 million
barrels a day of straight crude. And if you add in NGLs and if you add into straight natural gas,
you're talking about probably close to 30 to 40 million barrels of oil equivalent when it's all
said and done. Unbelievable volumes of unexpected oil and natural gas that we made available. It's
not that we discovered it. We always knew it was there, but we made it available. And if you don't
think that that is the or has been the seminal event of the last 20 years in the energy markets,
you're living under a rock. I don't know what to tell you. We believe based on the geological
properties of the shales, based on how much total resource and recoverable reserve is in each of
these shales. And I should point out, we have tools and analyses that I don't think anyone else has.
We have developed our own neural networks, talked about AI. We've been developing neural networks
here for seven or eight years to try to assess shale qualities, to try to assess the production
profiles of each individual well in the shale, and ultimately to try to get at a number of how
much reserve is in that shale to determine when half of that has been produced and when we think
production could roll over. And I don't know anybody else that's working on this type of stuff,
mainly probably because it's very technical, but also because with energy at 3.8% of the S&P
versus 15% historically, you've decimated investment houses, you've decimated sell-side
research, you've decimated buy-side guys. No one is doing this type of work anymore or very, very,
very few people with any type of a historical context. But we have the tools. Maybe we'll be
right, maybe we'll be wrong. We have high degree of confidence that we'll be right. And what those
models are all pointing to is the fact that now most of the shales, the Barnett, the Fayetteville,
the Eagle for the Bakken have already peaked and rolled over. And that the two big ones driving
supply thus far, the Permian on the oil side and the Marcellus on the gas side are set to roll over
in 2024. And if you look at the beginning of this year, January of this year, year-on-year growth in
the Permian was like six, 700,000 barrels a day. It's 40,000 barrels a day as at the last reading.
This growth on a year-on-year basis has slowed to nearly zero. It's about to turn negative. And
if you don't think that the biggest source of production rolling over is going to have as big
an impact as when it ramped up, I think you're going to be in for a little bit of a shock.
So do I think we can resolve out of this eventually? I do. Do I see exactly what
path that's going to take? Of course not. However, I think that in 2024 and beyond,
the idea that you've had this major seminal once in a century almost move in terms of bringing on
new production this quickly, now turning from a tailwind to a headwind, it has to be taken into
account. It has to be monitored very, very closely. And I think, frankly, it has to be invested in.
And the one thing that I would caution is this idea that the next shale, whether it literally
means the next shale on an international basis or the next shale style technology improvement
is right around the corner, that's a tough prediction. Of course, the answer is maybe.
However, I would caution against banking our hopes on an equilibrium or even oversupplied market
on the fact that we're going to pull another rabbit out of the hat the way we did with the
shales. The shales were really, really unique in a lot of ways. We knew where they were. We needed
a way to extract them. We figured out that way. And then we had this big whoosh as new supply came
on line. Look at the copper industry, just to give you a quick analogy. They did this in the 1990s
with something called solvent extraction electro winnowing, new technology. It boosted copper
supply by 20% over two or three years, maybe four or five years. Not dissimilar to what we're
talking about with shale. We're talking about bringing on 20 million barrels on 100 million
barrel market in the same ballpark. It depressed prices for nearly a decade, and then it peaked,
rolled over, and ran out. And now copper prices, instead of being 45, 50 cents, are 10 times
multiple of that. That's what I worry is happening here. We had this big shock to the system. I don't
know where the next one's coming. Maybe it will, but maybe it won't. And as of now, I don't see
evidence that we have that around the corner. Adam, first off, thank you so much for sharing
the forecasts, sobering as they are, from your proprietary model there about the production from
the shale. Let me just ask one question I think might be on viewers' minds here, which is, again,
most of the shale that we've talked about, the shale supply we've talked about so far in this
discussion, have been US-based. And so I think a regular person might say, OK, well, aren't there
other shale fields around the rest of the world that we can go after now that we have the technology
pretty much refined? It seems like you think that is not a slam dunk or wouldn't be necessarily easy
or fast. Why? So about 10 years ago, we asked ourselves the same question. And the reason we
asked ourselves this question was that the answers that people were putting forward, we felt to be
largely unsatisfactory. Most people were saying, well, the US has special land mineral laws,
different from anywhere else. And that means that we can do shale here, but not internationally,
because we own our minerals privately. Other people were saying, well, we have the pressure pumping
equipment here in the US. We don't have it anywhere else. And so we can't do it elsewhere.
And to me, I thought that was all complete nonsense. I mean, you could have made the same
case for conventional oil drilling after Colonel Drake struck oil in Pennsylvania. You could have
said, well, you can't do that in the Middle East. They don't have any rigs out there. Sure enough,
we brought the rigs out there. And I was convinced that the same would be true here.
What was more predictive when looking at the energy markets was instead the geology, the
endowment. Do you have major oil fields in other parts of the world? Do you have major shale basins
in other parts of the world? And so we tried to put that together. We put together a model.
The USGS has a lot of the data. It's just compiled very poorly. We put it together
in a way that we found was usable. We spoke to shale industry experts and said, look,
if you had to design a shale from the ground up, what would its geological qualities be?
Things like thickness and thermal maturity and seismicity, organic content, clay content,
all these different things, permeability, porosity, temperature as well. And so all
these different things we put into the matrix. And we said, OK, look, how do the US shales rank?
And how do the rest of the world shales rank? And the US shales of the 10 best, the US were the 7,
7 of the 10 best. It seems unfair. There's this sense, well, how could all of the shale be in the
US? Obviously, you're looking at it wrong. But the truth of the matter is that resource endowment on
a global basis is not uniform. It averages to something, but it's not a uniform average. South
Africa has the gold mines. Russia has the PGM deposits. Canada has the diamond, kimberlite
deposits. The United States has the shale deposits. It has to do with the fact that
most of the continent used to be this quiet inland sea. It was the perfect depositional
environment. It's quiet. It allowed for very thick sand packages. It had very low clay,
very high silica, all these things that made for a perfect shale. Where are the other ones? Well,
one's in Argentina, one's in Colombia, one's in Russia. Argentina's the Vaca Muerte. I would watch
that very closely. You know, YPF just suffered another unforced or self-enforced error just the
other day with its privatization efforts. So, you know, again, it's not looking like that's coming
on anytime soon. Colombia has a moratorium on shale production. And Russia has a triple mint
sanction on sharing Western shale technologies with Russia. That wasn't true in place for the
last 15 years. Whenever, you know, the Obama administration took off the Russian sanctions
or amended things, it was never on the table to even discuss the sanctions pertaining to Western
shale technologies into Russia. So is that something that could be removed one day? It's
totally possible. Is it something that they can do themselves and ultimately develop that industry
themselves? Certainly not on the timeline that we would need to avert a near-term energy crisis,
but medium-term and long-term, possible. Something to watch very, very closely. That would be the
mother of all shales. That would be like another Permian Basin that comes online. The question is,
I suppose, has depletion taken hold by that point to the point where we need another Permian Basin?
Time will tell. All right. Well, gentlemen, before we get to concluding remarks, I just want to make
sure there aren't any remaining key points that you wanted to raise in this discussion that I
haven't had the foresight to do so yet. Doomburg, maybe we'll start with you. Yeah, no, I would say
I very much enjoyed it. And even to what Adam just said, I think if those scenarios came to pass, I
would argue they don't necessarily mark cheap oil. They mark a temporary energy crisis that would
quickly resolve. For example, the Chinese could steal our technology and give it to the Russians
if things got bad enough. And frankly, it's not like we don't have a long enough track record of
that happening. And so, yeah, I just want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think conversations
like this, where people respect each other and politely articulate their views, are far too rare
in the clickbait-driven social media world that we all live in. And so I, for one, am very thrilled
to have been a participant of it. I read the GNR team stuff every time it comes out. And I certainly
am mindful that they do the same with us. And you, Adam, of course, are a gentleman of the highest
order. And so it's really fantastic and I'm proud to have been part of it. Well, thank you. Mr.
Rosenzweig? No, I had a wonderful time as well. We really respect your work. I'm glad to see we agree
on more than we disagree on. Please take me up on our fourth turning podcast idea. I think we could
easily fill an hour once a week and leave everyone depressed and also wanting more. I think that human
ingenuity is wonderful. I think our best days do lie ahead. But I think we're in an awful lot of
trouble here, mainly because we haven't spent enough money in the last 15 years on our energy
supply. And Doonberg, I thank you for putting out some of the really insightful analysis that you do,
even the ones that we don't agree with. I think you add a lot to the discourse of the global energy
market at a time when there's not a lot of people that are left doing this. So more power to you.
Continue to read your stuff. And thank you so much, Adam, for having us boast here. And I
thought it was great. Well, it's such a joy to be able to host discussions like this,
these respectful co-explorations rather than heated debates. I think, as Doonberg said,
way too rare. I appreciate you, too, for doing this in such a gentlemanly, scholarly way. I
think folks have learned an awful lot through this conversation. Both of you are welcome back
on this platform anytime you like, together, individually. If you haven't gotten that
poor-turning podcast up and running, but you want to do a trial run, please do it here.
As we wrap up here, folks, I do want to give both of you a chance to let folks
know, if they've really enjoyed your commentary, would like to follow you and your work,
where they should go. Doonberg, why don't we start with you?

Yeah, you can find us at Garing and Rosenzweig. If you get anywhere close to spelling it right,
Google will point you in the right direction, but our website is gorosen.com. We post all of
our quarterly letters and all of our podcasts and everything like that. I'll just say, in the spirit
of respectful dialogue, the one thing I might ask, just a little minor nit here, is, Doonberg,
could you put a tie on next time when we talk like this, just in the question of respect?
I'll put a tie on when Adam does, yeah.
All right, fair.
There we go. That might be a while, guys. All right, well, look, thanks so much, folks. If
