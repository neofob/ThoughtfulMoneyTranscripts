- Welcome to "Thoughtful Money."
It's founder and your host, Adam Taggart,
welcoming you here back at the end of yet another week
for another weekly market recap,
featuring my good friend,
Aquiline portfolio manager, Lance Roberts.
How you doing Lance?
- Maybe you're really stretching this week.
- You did, well look, I'm curious,
do you know what Aquiline means?
- I'm gonna just say no.
- Yeah, pass, that's the smart thing to do.
It means like an eagle, right?
We're familiar with hearing it like an Aquiline nose, right?
And that really is sort of like a beak-like nose,
like the eagle, but it's actually a general term
of or like an eagle.
And since you guys at RIA,
strive to be the eagle flying above the bulls and the bears,
I thought it was a particularly apt descriptor for you.
- Yeah, you know, we go along with Steve Miller, so.
(laughing)
- There you go, that should be like our lead-in theme song
for these things.
- Exactly, people are like,
"Well, let's talk about Steve Miller's who?"
I know, you got the old, you're old if you know,
it's so funny, they have all these videos out now,
it says, "Do you recognize these songs?"
And it's like these songs from the late 70s and early 80s.
And if you recognize three of the 10 songs,
you're officially an old person.
Like I know all 10 of them.
- Yeah, it's crazy they have these lists on the internet
of like sounds that like millennials and Gen Z
have never heard, like a busy signal, right?
Or the sound of a rotary phone
or the sound of a typewriter or, you know,
all these other things that us dinosaurs are like,
"Wow, really, they never heard that?"
But yeah.
- Exactly, internet dial-up.
- Internet dial-up, yeah, I haven't even heard that,
the AOL modem, yeah, exactly.
All right, well, look, let's talk about, first off,
glad to see that you're still alive
after the cold snap hitting Texas.
- Yeah, so it's really no big deal.
It's so funny, I mean, everybody was just like freaking out.
All the store shelves were completely barren.
And you know, you live in Texas, right?
So how do you know you live in Texas?
When you go to the store and all the sweet tea is sold out,
but there's plenty of unsweet tea, you know you're in Texas.
(both laughing)
- I mean, we're willing to stock up on the essentials,
but only, yeah, exactly.
Not only the ones that taste good.
- Yeah, go to the meat section.
The meat section is completely empty,
but go to the vegan section.
Plenty of fake meat there.
So you know you're in Texas.
- Plenty of kale still leftover.
- Exactly.
- All right, well, look, lots to talk about,
including the S&P knocking on the door of all-time highs.
Real quick, just want to let you give any update
you want to give about your upcoming event,
'cause that's coming up close now.
- Yeah, not just real close.
I mean, it's like next weekend.
So this coming Saturday,
not today when you're watching this video,
but this following Saturday, we're going to have our event
with Greg Valliere talking about presidential election cycles.
Adam will be there, myself,
Michael Leibovitz talking about bonds.
We're going to go through the markets, outlooks.
You know, all this about how to invest in this year
as we get ready to head into what is likely going to be
a fairly contentious presidential election
with all kinds of potential outcomes.
Greg Valliere is a really, really great speaker
and he's politically agnostic.
So he just talks about the facts, the data.
So it's not like a political commentary,
but it's the impact of politics on the markets
and how to invest for it.
So it's going to be really great.
We're opening the doors at 7.30, feed you breakfast.
We're going to have several presentations
going in the afternoon, feed you lunch.
And then Adam's going to narrate a panel for us
where we'll take live Q&A from the audience.
So if you have questions, I would love to see you there.
We can't record this because of copyright issues,
so it's a live event only.
So we're actually having it in Hotel Sinesta in Houston.
So you can book a room there, spend the night
and come to the conference the next morning
and then get back to the airport,
which is really easy from that particular hotel.
It's a straight shot back to Intercontinental Airport.
Tickets are online now though.
So go to realinvestmentadvice.com,
click on the banner at the top of the page.
I've got lots of emails from people going,
"Where is the banner?"
It's top of the page, realinvestmentadvice.com.
Just click that link.
It takes you right to Eventbrite
and you can buy your ticket.
- Great, and folks, I think I did this last time.
I will have a link to the actual conference page
down as the pinned comment underneath this video.
So if you want to get there quickly,
just click on that link and go.
Yeah, I'm always looking forward,
I mean, I'm looking forward to the event.
I always enjoy events like these, Lance.
I mean, one for the Idea Exchange
and to hang out with you and Mike and others there
in person is going to be great.
Can't wait to see the main keynote.
But I also really enjoy these just for the mingling.
Like they'd be able to hang out and talk to people
that are regular viewers who come up
and have regular questions, feedback
on what we should do with the show.
They're just always super interesting people.
I always have great discussions.
So looking forward to seeing you there in a week, buddy.
Okay, all right, let's see here.
Let's start with the market action.
The day that you and I are recording this, Lance,
S&P looks like it's got a shot
to potentially hit a new all-time high.
If it doesn't, it's probably going to hit it pretty soon.
So what are you seeing in this market action?
Is this looking bullish to you?
Is he getting concerned about valuations?
I know you have a piece out
where you're saying they're still at risk.
So what do you think?
Well, right now, in the short term,
valuations don't matter.
We talk a lot about fundamentals
and earnings and these type of things,
but from day-to-day action, it means nothing.
Very interesting chart out on Twitter this morning,
talking about what do you think
the biggest driver of the markets is?
And by and large, it's Fed policy.
And then earnings are kind of coming second,
and third is liquidity, which is Fed policy.
So really by and large, it's not earnings,
it's not valuations.
We don't invest on fundamentals anymore.
We invest on what the Fed is doing
and whether or not they're expanding monetary policy or not.
So that's what drives markets.
And so just a couple of things here is,
let's not get too overly excited just yet.
Yes, markets have rallied here for a couple of days,
which has been nice.
And we are starting to push up.
The NASDAQ did set a new all-time high earlier this week.
And yes, the S&P will follow here at some point.
But right now, we're still within this consolidation range.
We're just trying to break out above it on Friday.
But we're right there.
And the markets have got to make a convincing breakout
to the upside.
We're still on a sell signal as shown in the upper panel.
We're still overbought as shown by the lower panel.
We're still working through that overbought process.
But none of that means that the market can't go ahead
and push higher here and try to make an all-time high.
So, and again, because the NASDAQ has done it
and because the big drivers that are in the NASDAQ
are also the big drivers of the S&P,
that's your magnificent seven,
considering those are what's driving the market
once again this year so far,
we'll probably see that new high sooner than later.
And it is what it is.
I mean, just because markets are on a sell signal
and they currently are overbought
doesn't mean markets can't gravitate higher short-term.
It does suggest though that upside is probably limited,
which has really been the case this year.
Ever since we've kind of triggered the sell signal,
markets really haven't gone anywhere.
We just kind of traded back and forth.
We keep kind of, we rally a little bit for a couple of days
and we sell off for a couple of days
and rally for a couple of days.
And that's really all that's been going on here
really ever since mid December.
But again, that's also bullish
because markets are consolidating.
They're not selling off, which means,
and one thing we've seen repeatedly
is at the end of the day,
like the markets will sell off early in the day
and then rally into the end of the day.
And so buyers are showing up in those institutional hours
at the last part of the day to step in and buy stocks.
That's kind of what you want to see.
And that's very bullish.
In two weeks, and remember we talked about this
specifically back in last October
when markets were selling off and were deeply oversold.
And we said, "Hey, we're going to get a year-end rally."
One of the key drivers, there's gonna be three drivers
for that, one is negative sentiment,
two is year-end positioning,
and three is corporate buybacks.
And in October, that corporate buyback window was closed.
It was going to open first part of November.
And that's when the rally started.
And we had a huge surge in corporate share buybacks
in November and December,
which was a key driver behind that rally
for those two months.
That window closed mid December, heading into earnings.
It's now going to reopen in two more weeks.
So once we get through this month,
that corporate share buyback window will open
as we head into February and March.
And we could see some potential,
depending on how strong those buybacks are,
that's going to be another kind of support
to push asset prices here in the short term.
So again, nothing wrong here at all with the markets.
They're continuing to kind of do what they do.
If you want to talk about, there's a concern
or whatever it is, the only concern that I can come up with
and again, it's really just a question
of how the markets are behaving.
We're back to the same type of analysis
that we were doing last year.
The big madness of seven, which is Google,
which is your communication space,
Meta, which is in your communication space,
Apple, Microsoft and video, which is in technology,
those by and far away are driving the S&P
versus everything else.
And so, eventually you would think at some point
that we're going to get some type of rotation
within the markets and some of these out of favor sectors
will become much more relevant to the overall market.
But you can kind of see this once again,
when we look at the relative
versus absolute performance of the market,
communications by far and away the leaders.
And then at the bottom is energy utilities and materials,
which are economically sensitive.
So again, and this little dot over here is technology.
So the communications and tech by far and away,
leading kind of the momentum of the market momentarily.
And we would expect that to change at some point,
but this was the story of all last year as well.
- Right.
- And then the same thing really goes
if we take a look at factors,
which are all the different kind of forms
of what drives the market,
whether it's small cap, mid cap, large cap,
mega capital growth, mega cap growth, those types of things.
We see momentum, mega cap growth,
the large cap stock driven indexes,
those are leading the charge
and everything else is just kind of dragging around.
Gold miners are way out of favor, equal weights dropping.
So we're seeing that same kind of rotation in the market
so far this year that drove the market most of last year,
that's disappointing because it leaves a lot of stocks
out of the race, but it is what it is.
- Right, and it's interesting to see ARK down there
in that bottom left quadrant, because it, I believe,
correct me if I'm wrong, is it's showing,
it really is the mag seven that's pulling everything up
that even the rest of technology is being left behind.
- Yeah, and same thing with RSP is fairly down here
and heading towards oversold small caps,
international markets.
Remember, we had all this conversation last year
that international is cheap relative to the US,
it's going to be the place to be
and it's already underperforming this year
by a significant degree.
A lot of the rally that small caps had
in November and December, they've given that up.
So, again, we're just seeing that migration
out of those areas back into this handful of stocks
where it's more, two reasons for that.
One is high liquidity, it's easy in, easy out.
So, if I'm managing a couple of billion dollars
or 5 billion or a hundred billion,
it's easy for me to buy Apple, Microsoft, and Google.
I can shove a lot of money in there,
it doesn't affect the price of the stock.
And if something goes wrong,
I can get it out fairly quickly
without devastating the stock price.
Can't do that with all these small cap companies.
The second thing is what we call earning certain.
These companies, we know going into earning season,
they're going to crank out their earnings, right?
They're going to, Google, Microsoft,
they're going to have earnings growth,
Amazon's going to have earnings growth.
We're going to see that on the data side of their business.
So, from an earning certain standpoint,
we see that there and if we look at earnings overall,
earnings growth is expected to come
from technology and communications.
Pretty much everything else is going to have
flat to negative earnings growth this year,
a little bit coming out of healthcare as well,
but not nearly to the extent of the drivers
being technology, communications,
kind of really just driving that whole earnings growth
that we're expecting to see out of the market.
- I guess there's another factor on that too,
which is just, and it's what works, right?
I mean, for a long time, I mean, a long time,
back when they were FANG and then there was MAGA
and then there was all sorts of FANG men
and I mean, just all sorts of other acronyms.
Now it's the magnificent seven, right?
Basically that small complex has been the engine
that has pulled the markets higher
for really the past decade minus 2022, right?
- Yeah, well, and again, we've talked about it before,
it's when every dollar that goes into an ETF,
30 cents of it goes into basically 10 stocks.
- I think it's like 37 cents or something,
that's closer to 40, I think.
- Yeah, it's pushing up there.
So, but again, when you have,
and with most people now giving up trading stocks
and just buying ETFs, especially on the retail side
and you take a look at retail flows
of how much money's flowing in from retail investors,
how much money there's flowing into ETFs
versus individual stocks, there's this big divergence.
So, every time they just pile in and buy,
I'm just gonna buy the S&P and just kind of live my life,
that's fine and dandy,
but you're sending 40 cents of 35, 40,
whatever the number is now into just a handful of stocks.
So they just keep getting this money flow.
Again, another reason why hedge funds
wanna buy these stocks is they know
they're gonna get an embedded amount of inflow of capital
into those stocks,
which are gonna drive the stock prices higher.
- All right.
Hey, do me a favor, pull back up the original chart you had,
the normal one that we see every week.
- Oh, okay.
- I just want you to, I kind of get it,
but I just want you to explain to people,
'cause I think in some people's brains,
it just feels counterintuitive
that we can still have a sell signal in place,
but be hitting an all time high.
- Yeah.
Well, just because sell signals are always interesting
from standpoint, because it doesn't mean
that just because you have a sell signal,
it doesn't mean markets have to crash, right?
And this is why people get confused by technical indicators.
Oh, they don't, technical indicators is all voodoo,
it doesn't work.
And sometimes technical indicators will give you a signal
and then the market will do something else
for a period of time.
And we can kind of look back at a similar period,
we got a sell signal back in late June.
And we were talking about here on the show,
we're saying, "Hey, we got a sell signal here,
suggest that upside might be somewhat limited in the market."
And then the market just kept rallying into July,
'cause we had all this chase of AI
right in the middle of that whole momentum driven AI moment.
And so it's like, "Ah, see, the technical indicators
are wrong, the markets are still going up
because of what it is."
We're like, "Hey, just be careful with this,
because what this indicator is telling you
is that you're going to have a correction of some sort."
And we did, it just took a little bit longer to get there.
And then you had that 10% correction
going into October of last year.
So it's not uncommon when you have a sell signal
that the market's upside is limited,
doesn't mean it has to go down.
And we have been working through this overbought process
now for over a month.
So again, it's not surprising.
And we talked about before,
even in the correction of anything,
whether it's economic data
or whether it's stock market prices
or an individual stock price,
the stock price can be declining,
but it's going to bounce on the way down, right?
It's going to head to lower lows,
it's headed in that direction.
But even during that bounce lower,
you're going to have these spurts of activity
where buyers step in and buy it.
They run the price up a bit and then they sell it all again.
And so that's what happens sometimes
with these technical indicators
is they give you a good signal.
We've had a good signal here for the last month or so.
And now we're starting to get some indicators.
And again, if this sell signal turns back into a buy signal,
it's going to do so at a fairly high level.
So what does that mean?
Well, it means the market's likely going to go up,
but that upside advance is probably limited
because you're moving from a slightly reduced level
back to a very overbought level very quickly.
So the upside of the market is going to be a lot more limited.
So in other words,
instead of seeing another 15% advance
like we saw in October, November,
where we started from extremely oversold levels,
see, this was a perfect setup back in October,
late October, September and late October,
because we were very oversold on multiple levels.
And that gave the market room.
We had very negative sentiment, positioning was weak.
People had sold everything.
The outlook was terrible.
And that's a great contrarian setup
for a nice rally in the market,
which is exactly what we saw.
So we had this nice 15% advance.
If you get a buy signal here, that's fine.
It's going to suggest the market's
going to set an all time high,
but we're likely not going to get a whole bunch more
after that because you're already back to overbought.
You've already stretched the buyers and sellers.
We never had a big reduction in the buyers.
The sellers really never came out in force.
So that imbalance of buyers and sellers
is still not there yet that you need
to create a much bigger advance in the market.
Optimism's still high.
Allocations are very high.
Cash allocations are very low.
So that's, you will get a breakout to the upside.
It may move another two, three, 4%,
but then we're going to have another correction
coming fairly shortly.
- Okay.
So we've been trading in this pink box
for the past month or so.
So we've been range bound.
If I heard you correctly earlier,
the longer we trade in that box,
the more bullish you become
about the market's future direction.
'Cause it's consolidating.
It's burning off whatever might remain
of the previous overbought conditions
and then giving the market a little bit more room
to run higher.
But before we turned on the camera here,
we were sort of talking about the psychological
magnetic force of both big round numbers
and all time highs and whatnot.
So from that conversation,
it seems like you and I both agree
that we're probably going to hit a new all time high here
if one hasn't even been hit by the end of the day,
just because markets like to say,
don't think I can make a new all time high?
Here, hold my beer, right?
Yeah, so with that,
the gravitational force of a big round number,
at 4,800 on the S&P, 5,000 isn't all that far away.
So I'm just going to ask you
to prognosticate a little bit.
You think we'll hit 5,000 this year?
- Our target for this year.
So look, you've always got to,
at the beginning of every year,
Wall Street comes out and they go,
here's our estimate of ranges for this year.
And the market's going to do this or that
or the other thing, whatever it is.
And they're always bullish.
They're always extremely optimistic
about the outlook for the market
and kind of where we're going to be
over the next year or so, whatever.
And right now the average estimate for the S&P
is around 5,100 for this year.
So I don't like doing that because again,
there's so many things that can happen
and trying to predict anything more than about a year out
is really kind of futile to do that.
But that's why we do this analysis
that we publish at the beginning of every year,
which looks at a variety of ranges in the market.
So if you take a look at valuations,
earnings growth, those types of things,
and then we can say, okay, look,
if we have a year where we have multiple expansions,
so it's a year where we increase the multiple of the market,
but we don't really grow earnings that much,
which is kind of what we saw in 2020, last year in 2023.
We had a big year, multiple expansion, market was up 22%.
Earnings didn't really grow that much.
So if we want to say, look,
we're going to be at 24 times earnings
at the end of this year on a multiple expansion basis,
that's 5,200.
But if we do have an economic slowdown
and we have to reprice for lower earnings,
then you're probably talking about a historical multiple
closer to 19, and now you're talking maybe 4,600
in that range, somewhere around there.
So there's nothing that, and again,
this is just how the market's going to process data
this year, a lot's going to depend on the Fed,
whether they aggressively loosen policy or not,
whether or not you have a recession,
whether or not economic activity is going to generate
the earnings growth that people expect.
And so from that, you can build kind of a range of estimates
that run anywhere right now from about 4,200 to 5,200.
So you've got about a thousand point range.
That's really anybody's guess of how this year turns out.
- All right, all right.
And I was just sort of thinking as we get closer to 5,000,
do you get this increased like tractor beam old to it?
Just because of the psychology, right?
We want to ring that bell.
- Yeah, no, absolutely.
If we can break the site.
So the all time highs right around 4,804,
and we're knocking on that door right now
for an all time high.
So we're not there yet.
We haven't set it as a Friday while we're talking right now.
We haven't done it yet.
It doesn't mean we won't by the end of the day.
But no, if you can break decisively above 4,800,
then that, you're going to get a lot of excitement
in the headlines and the media is like,
"Oh, it's a new all time high.
The bear market of 2022 is now officially over."
So it wasn't a bear market.
It was a correction because you consolidated it
and broke out of it very quickly.
If there's a bear market,
bear markets generally take five years
to get back to new all time highs.
Different story, different conversation the other day.
But if we get above that level,
the correction will officially be over.
Investors will now have made some money
over the last two years.
So they'll start to actually catch up
on your 6% a year that they've missed out on.
And now that push towards
that psychological big round number of 5,000,
it's going to be there, but it's 200 points.
200 points on 5,000.
I mean, it's not that it's 10%.
So it's not that big of an advance
from where we are right now.
But again, that's about average
for what we would expect in a pre-presidential election.
- Okay. All right.
Well, look, I got to move on from here
just because we got a ton of other stuff coming up,
but related to this conversation,
you do have a new piece out.
It's titled Q4 Earnings Season Gets Underway
With Low Expectations.
This just sort of seems like more what we're used to, right?
You like to call it millennial earning season, right?
Where everybody gets a trophy, right?
We keep ratcheting down the expectations
so at the end of the day, everybody can step over it
and declare victory.
A lot of charts, a lot of other stuff in that piece.
Anything about it you want to highlight, let's do that.
I do want to note in there just because it's relevant
to what we were just talking about,
you do have a section in there called
valuations still at risk.
And so I do want to get a sense for your level of comfort
right now with general market valuations
given that we're at this breakout point, right?
If you're concerned, presumably,
if you're concerned about where valuations are today,
they jump higher from here in the short term,
I'm going to guess you're going to get even more concerned
about valuations.
- Right. Well, look, I'm a fundamental investor.
At the end of the day,
when it's all said and done, we look at fundamentals.
In the short term, fundamentals don't matter.
Valuations don't matter.
Value in the course of 12 months.
So again, the crime that we have committed as Wall Street
and the media on individual investors
is that we have turned the markets into a giant casino.
Look, shows like yours, shows like mine, shows like CNBC,
we talk about stuff that's here and now today, right?
It's like, oh, this is happening in China,
or this is happening in Israel.
And so we all immediately gravitate,
trying to figure out what does that mean for the markets
over the next one day, two day, five day, 10 day.
It really doesn't matter.
What we should be doing,
if we were being prudent analysts,
we should be saying, look, over the next five years,
this is what the market should do
based on these economic drivers.
What happens between one year and five years is irrelevant.
But when you're talking about fundamentals,
it takes time for these fundamental plays to work out.
And so you've got to give them time.
The problem is the average holding period for investors
is now less than four months.
So what's the point of talking about valuations
that are going to take five or 10 years to play out
when you're holding periods four months, right?
So valuations matter and they matter a lot
because valuations are what will ultimately drive
your returns over time.
And it is a function of just how math works.
So if valuations are expected to contract
because they're very elevated right now,
and we expect the valuation contraction
over the next 10 years,
your returns will be closer to zero or less.
If you have a good valuation multiple
and you can make the case for a valuation expansion
over the next 10 years, your returns are going to be high.
So it's just simply that.
But so we don't even talk about that.
We're all focused right now.
And I've ranted on this a good bit on our show last year,
talking about the biggest fallacy
and the biggest crime that individuals do to themselves.
And the reason that the majority of investors
are not successful at investing their own money.
And again, I'll say the majority, not all.
But most people are not successful
at managing their own money
because they benchmark their performance
from January the 1st to December 31st
and look at an S&P index, which has nothing to do
with your financial outcome.
Instead of looking at their portfolio over three years
or a five-year period,
say, have I done over three or five years?
Am I generating a rate of return
that'll get me to retirement?
It doesn't matter what the stock market does.
It doesn't.
What matters is, is are you generating enough money
to get to your goal?
- Are you making progress towards your goal?
- Right, yeah.
And that's what's important.
But see, we don't do that.
We're also focused on trying to beat
this mythical index game, which has no cash,
has a substitution effect, pays no taxes,
has no fees or expenses.
It's just, it has nothing to do
with how your portfolio actually works.
But this is what, we want to chase this phantom car
that doesn't even really exist in the real world.
So, and this is why we make so many mistakes
on managing our money
and why our return and outcomes are poor over time.
And if you don't believe that,
that's why 80% of people, even though they're invested,
have no money in the bank because they don't do well.
So, you know, this is, so valuation is very important.
Yes, I'm concerned.
Valuations are currently running
at about 24 times reported earnings,
21 times operating earnings,
which if you don't know what operating is are,
if you don't know, if you don't know the difference,
the reason that Wall Street switched
from GAAP earnings in the nineties
to operating earnings in 2000
was because operating earnings look a whole lot better
because basically it strips out all the stuff
that can happen to a company like paying expenses.
So, you know, it's the most optimistic outcome.
You know, and if you don't know what operating,
they're also called performa.
Performa earnings used to be in the back
of the 10Q report that was put out by companies.
GAAP earnings were in the front
because that's what's reported for IRS purposes.
In the very back, they said,
hey, this was our projection
of what we thought we would do this year,
the GAAP report, what we actually did.
And there's always a big difference between those two.
But because Wall Street like the operating numbers
are always positive and always optimistic
because there are unicorn numbers.
If everything in the world goes right this year,
we're going to have this fantastic rate of growth.
So Wall Street says, hey, let's use those numbers
because now that makes everything look better
and we can sell more stocks based on those numbers
than we can sell on GAAP earnings.
So we started using these operating earnings
to make everything look better.
So there's currently a big gap between operating earnings
going forward over the next 12 months
versus expected GAAP earnings.
And that GAAP is going to close at some point.
If you have an economic slowdown,
those operating numbers go right out the window.
And the problem with using operating earnings as an investor
is that you wind up overpaying for stocks consistently.
And then when GAAP becomes a reality,
that's why you have these big drawdowns in stocks
and why you lose a lot of money in stocks very quickly
is because that reality comes home very quickly
into the numbers.
So yes, I'm very concerned about valuations
over the next 10 years,
based on where valuations are right now,
your returns are going to be close to zero.
And look, you've already had two years
of a zero rate of return.
We're not back to all-time highs yet.
We went through January 22,
all the way through January of 23 to January of 24,
and the market's still not back to all-time highs yet.
Yes, we're close, but we're not there yet,
which means you've had two years.
If you were expecting 6% growth each year,
you have not done that.
You spent a year losing money and a year getting it back.
That's not making money, that's breaking even,
and that's not investing.
So that's how, over time,
you can have these big rallies in the markets
in a great period to go examine about valuations
and what happens in return.
Go look back in 2000 to 2017,
go back and look at 1960 to 1975.
Those are periods where markets returns,
and of course, not to mention 1929 to 1950,
those are periods where investors spent decades,
a decade or more, I should say, not decades,
that makes it sound much worse,
but they spend a decade or more basically making no money,
and returns, and you hear a lot of this stat,
you know, there's no period in history
where 10 years have had a negative rate of return.
Well, it's not exactly true once you include inflation.
There's no period where the market
had a negative rate of return.
Not really true after inflation.
There are very long periods,
but even if I have a 20-year period on a nominal basis,
making 1% over 20 years ain't getting me to my goal, right?
So valuations matter a lot.
We just don't recognize that now
because we're so tied up in our four-month window
that we're trading stocks.
We're not looking at the long-term ramifications,
what's going to happen to our money over time.
- Got it, all right.
Well put.
One quick clarification.
You kept mentioning gap earnings.
I just want to, and then you talked about the gap
between performers and gap earnings.
When you're talking about gap earnings,
you're talking about generally accepted
accounting principles, GAAP.
That's what that acronym stands for.
It's basically, you know,
because companies have to report on a regular basis,
the gap standard basically tells them what's acceptable.
In other words, you just can't make anything up,
report it willy-nilly any way you want to
to try to make it look as rosy as possible.
You actually have to follow these specific accounting rules.
And again, because they kind of bleed all the fun out of it,
you know, that's where the pro forma stuff got,
you know, it started getting more attention
because Wall Street realized it could sell that sizzle.
Right?
- Exactly.
And again, you know, and GAAP earnings
are also known as reported earnings.
So when you hear the term reported earnings, that is GAAP.
That's the same thing.
And by the way, just be careful with that statement, Adam,
because there was a study by McKinsey
and a couple of other big accounting firms,
and they surveyed the accounting statements
and CFOs of major companies.
And they found out that up to 10%
of the GAAP reported earnings
are fudged by the CFOs of companies
to make the numbers look better for reporting.
- Although that technically is called fraud, but.
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, yeah, we just fudge, it's just small fudges.
But that's why we do stock buybacks as well,
because it makes reported earnings look better.
- Right.
All right, and then, you know, to your point about,
if you're understandably very concerned about valuations
that we, you know, could be looking at a prolonged period
of kind of zero returns in the market,
you know, an investor might hear that and say,
well, geez, then why play the game then, right?
Like why put my money in the market
if it's not gonna do anything likely
for the next five years, right?
And I think the answer to that,
but I wanted you to give your own, you know, is,
hey, yeah, even in a period where the market is flat
from beginning point A to end point B,
there's a lot of road to travel in there,
and there's a lot of volatility,
and there's ups and there's downs,
and that, yes, a passive portfolio
may make zero return over this period,
but an actively managed portfolio has the potential
to make money on the upsides, money on the downsides.
You gotta get a good, you know,
experienced professional to help you navigate that,
but you can still make money over that time.
You're not doomed to a zero percent return.
- Yeah, no, that's right.
And again, if you look back, you know,
a great period to look back at,
and so, you know, we're talking about math, right?
And so if I have a year, just, you know,
let's just do it this way, right?
We'll make it really easy, so 10 years.
So in year one, I have a 10% return, a gain,
in year two, I have a 10% loss,
in year three, I have a 10% gain,
year four, I have a 10% loss, just back and forth.
We do that for 10 years, right?
Well, if you add that up over time,
because the 10% loss is always more ultimately on paper
than the 10% gain, you actually wind up losing money.
And so you look back over that 10 year period and go,
my return was basically zero, a little bit less.
My return was basically zero over 10 years,
but I had five years where I had 10% gains,
how does that happen?
And a great period to go look at is go look at 1999, 2000,
through 2013, '15, '17, somewhere around there.
And you can look at it nominally,
you can look at it inflation adjusted, it's all the same.
But during that period, returns were basically zero,
but you had very strong bull market rallies in there, right?
2003 to 2007 have a nice, big, strong bull market rally.
Then you have a 50% correction,
you have the 50% correction coming off the dotcom crash.
So when you start looking at these periods
where you give up big chunks of your gains,
you can look back over that timeframe and say,
what was my net return on a buy and hold basis?
But to your point, Adam,
this is the important thing about active management.
If I can avoid those big downturns to some degree,
I don't have to avoid all of it, right?
If the markets are down 50 and you're down 10, that's okay.
Nothing wrong with that.
Because when you get that next bull market cycle,
you're going to be back to even very quickly
and then start making money.
And there's going to be an any sideways market
over a period of time,
you're going to have these periods of a year or two
where the market really takes off, does tremendous,
and then you're going to wind up giving up a bunch of it.
My big concern going forward is looking back,
and we've written some articles about this here recently.
If you look back through history from 1900 to 2023,
the market return on average about 8% a year.
That's exactly what it should do.
That's 6% capital appreciation,
which aligns with 6% economic growth,
4% in dividends, less inflation.
So I get you about 8%.
That's exactly what the market should do.
So if you look at 1900 to 2008,
markets kicked off about 8% a year annualized.
Now that's not average, markets don't do that every year.
You didn't get 8% a year.
There were big long periods
where you had zero rates of return.
You have massive drawdowns in '74 and 2000 and 2008.
So you got to be careful when somebody says,
"Oh, the average return is this."
That's the average, that's not reality.
Very, very big difference about how that impacts your money.
But the important thing is,
is that from 2009 through 2023,
markets returned 12% a year on average.
And that's because of 43 trillion of capital
invested in the markets.
We talked about this in the show before.
So my concern going forward is,
unless the Fed is going to go back to zero interest rates,
doing successive rounds of quantitative easing
of $120 billion a month or whatever it is,
and the government's going to start sticking
a lot of capital back into the system,
sending checks to households or whatever,
then where's all the liquidity going to come from
to generate that 12% annualized rate of return?
X that, we get back to economic growth of 2%,
which means stocks will return 2%
because stocks and the economy are basically linked.
2% dividend yield, so there's four,
minus inflation of two, so you're back to two.
So without all that monetary liquidity,
returns are going to be a lot lower.
But even if returns go back to 8% a year,
that's going to be really disappointing
compared to the 12 everybody's gotten used to, right?
So it's going to, and look,
I get emails from people all the time.
It's like, "Oh, hey, look, Lance,
I'm going to give you some money to manage.
I just need 15% a year to reach my goal."
I'm like, "Thank you very much for emailing.
Have a great day."
It's not realistic,
but that's what people have gotten used to
over the last 10 years,
because all this massive surge in monetary liquidity,
and I don't know whether or not we can sustain that.
I do know that in order to sustain the level of spending
that we're doing, and I have an article out today
on the website at realinvestmentadvice.com
calls talking about how the deficits are sustaining
or economic growth.
- It's on my list, we're getting there.
- Okay, well, in order to fund that deficit,
the Federal Reserve will have to monetize
up to 40% of that debt long-term,
which means you're talking about a Fed balance sheet now
north of $30 trillion at some point
to monetize that debt into 2050.
So that's the only way you can keep justifying
just an exponentially high multiple in the market
and this continued growth rate in stocks,
because stocks are no longer attached to economic reality.
And either at some point,
stocks are gonna have to return back
to what the economy can actually generate,
or you're gonna have to have this massive surge of liquidity
that just continues indefinitely.
And at some point, stock buybacks even become problematic
because companies are gonna buy themselves back.
I mean, there's only so many shares out there.
And when was the last time you saw an Apple or a Microsoft
split their stock?
- Yeah, a long time.
This is sort of getting to the Stephanie Pomboy.
She's like, "Look, there's so many things
out there right now.
I really don't know what I have confidence in,
except that I think that the pressure release valve
for all this is going to be,
and she was talking about this more in a short term,
but I know she's talking about a long-term as well,
is gonna be the dollar,
meaning the purchasing power of the dollar
is gonna be sacrificed, right?
So the Fed goes and monetizes all that stuff,
regardless of what the reported inflation rate is,
the dollar is just gonna buy less, right?
- Maybe, but that didn't happen
during the last monetization round.
The dollar got stronger.
- No, no, no.
I think you're talking about the DXY.
I'm just talking about purchasing power.
I'm just talking about regular people
and what their money can buy.
Like, if you live the past,
if you lived during the period of leading up to 2022, right?
And we had too little inflation, right?
As the Fed kept saying.
The average person was like,
"What the hell are you talking about?"
I mean, we didn't have the crushing inflation
we've had in the past two years,
but the average person was seeing a lot of stuff go up.
You know, I remember railing about health insurance
going up double digit year after year after year
long before things got crazy with COVID, right?
- Well, but again, those are policy choices.
We've talked about that before.
I mean, you know, the affordable care-
- Well, so is monetizing 40% of the debt.
- Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But also, you know, Affordable Care Act,
when we talked about those issues previously,
you know, that's what drug or healthcare costs are.
- Oh, sure, but I could have said that
about a ton of other things as well.
- Yeah, so I'm saying it's not just the Fed monetizing debt
that causes that problem.
But yeah, I know I don't disagree
with what you or she is saying.
She's right from my standpoint.
You know, the problem with debt,
and we've said this so many times,
is it doesn't generate economic prosperity.
It does just the opposite.
It's a massive wealth transfer from the poor,
the middle class, to the rich.
And this is why, if you take a look at, you know,
it was an interesting chart out the other day.
It says, you know, 36% of the market is owned by households
and the rest is owned by foreign investors and pensions
and those types of things, right?
So, but households own a tremendous chunk
of the stock market.
Sounds encouraging until you realize that 90,
basically 90% of that is owned by 10% of income earners.
Actually, it's 93% that they just came out of.
Yeah, 93% is owned by the top 10% of households, yeah.
Be careful on this, Lance, 'cause you can wind me up
and we can talk a whole more time.
- I'm just saying, you know, the issue,
to Stephanie's point, I'm agreeing with her,
is that the things that we're doing
to sustain a minimal rate of economic activity
and rather than letting the economy grow organically
or contract organically, as it should be led to do,
we're just making things worse
for the vast majority of Americans,
'cause we're just transferring their wealth
to the upper income classes
or the ones that are providing the jobs,
providing the stuff, right, that we all use and consume,
the service, you know, the service providers,
whatever they are, you know,
those are the people that are absorbing the capital
that we're getting.
And so we keep doing these kinds of same, you know,
bad, making these bad same decisions
over and over and over again,
expecting a different outcome
and things just keep getting worse
for the poor and the middle class.
- All right, well, now you've done it
'cause I am gonna dig more deeply into this now with you.
And I still have a lot to get through,
so we have to box this.
Real quick, I just want to,
a note I made after reading your deficit spending piece.
I don't know if you saw it today,
but there was a little like TikTok clip
that was making its way around
that I grabbed it 'cause I said,
maybe this is the perfect visualization
for this eternal deficit spending.
It's a rat on the New York subway
and he got stuck on an escalator
and he's trying to get up the escalator,
but he didn't realize it's an escalator.
So he's just in this loop where he's not going anywhere,
but he keeps going up stair after stair after stair
and he's wondering why he's not getting anywhere, right?
And it's sort of-
- It's sad.
- It's sad.
And of course they're putting it to like Rocky music
and that stuff, right?
But is that a good visualization
of where we are right now, deficit spending,
where we have to kind of keep spending more and more
just to keep the system going
at this relatively anemic rate, right?
- Yeah, I mean, without the deficit spending,
we would be in a deep recession, right?
I mean, there's no two ways about it.
And so, yeah, we have to keep spending more.
If it wasn't for the CHIPS Act,
if it wasn't for the Inflation Reduction Act,
if it wasn't for all this other money
that we've put out there,
we would be in a much worse situation.
And by the way, just from a political standpoint,
it's not the president that does this.
We all blame the president,
President Trump, President Biden, whoever,
we're blaming for these issues.
They're not the ones that spend money, it's Congress.
Congress has the purse springs.
They're the ones that pass the bills and it approves it,
and that's how money gets spent.
And yes, the president has to sign off on it,
but Congress is the one that drives the spending.
And so, when we look at who we're really voting for,
the president really doesn't matter nearly as much,
and we make a big deal out of the president,
but you really got to look at who you're electing
in the Congress and the Senate.
That's where all the problems actually occur.
But we just keep,
our whole reality has now become,
and look at what's happening with this whole debt ceiling.
We just kind of keep kicking the debt ceiling out.
We say, oh, we got, we don't pass the spending bill,
which we just passed a spending bill yesterday,
which will kick the can down for another couple of months
until we hit the can again.
But we just keep spending more and more money
and we don't even have a budget.
We just, we'll just spend the same amount of money
and we'll just approve some more.
- Right, and starting to wrap it,
technically, we don't even have a debt ceiling right now.
- Yeah, exactly.
- It was Armageddon, and then we just agreed,
well, you know what, we'll just pretend it doesn't exist
for the next year.
- And so we can just kind of keep spending money at,
but this is what politicians want
because it keeps them in office.
It's what makes people feel good.
I thought there was a really great video
on TikTok the other day.
There was a reporter and he went into Chicago suburbs,
and most of these are the suburbs,
kind of these are the lower income suburbs of Chicago.
And President Biden recently passed a spending bill
that was going to spend like $240 million
in these underserved areas of Chicago and other major cities,
so Houston, Chicago, San Francisco and others,
where he spent all this money
on these underserved communities.
And so he was interviewing the people,
the citizens of these communities and say,
what do you think about this?
The Biden administration is going to spend all this money
in your community.
What do you think?
It's like, oh, this would be great.
We can get afterschool programs,
keep our kids off the street.
We can get better education system for our kids.
We can get better healthcare services for our families,
which are really lacking.
You know, one of the big problems right now
that's happening in a lot of these cities
is they're getting food deserts because of all the theft.
Grocery stores are leaving, and so they need services.
They need access to services.
And so they were like, this is great.
All this money will be fantastic for our community.
And then the reporter says, yeah,
they're going to be putting electric chargers
into your neighborhoods for electric vehicles.
And they're like,
nobody can afford an electric vehicle in the neighborhood.
What's this going to do for us, right?
But this is government, right?
We, you know, who's the, go back now,
and we've talked about this before,
who benefits from putting electric chargers
in these underserved communities, right?
What bill, what lobby effort was done saying,
oh, Mr. Biden, you need to put electric car chargers
in these underserved neighborhoods for electric vehicles
that they don't even have because they can't afford them.
This is good.
And so now we're going to spend all this money
that's going to make the providers of these chargers
a lot richer,
but it's not going to help society or the economy at all.
And this is the problem with all of our spending.
If you take a look at all of our spending,
it's never directed at increasing the economic prosperity
of the vast majority of Americans.
It always benefits a very small, finite group of people
that are generally the providers of the goods or services
that are the receivers of the money.
- It's lining the pocket of a special interest
that pushed for the initiative.
All right, look, we could talk about this forever.
So I got to not, but here was the,
I want to talk about it a little bit more
'cause this was the question I wanted to ask you.
And this is probably a whole video in and of itself,
but I just want to at least scratch it
with you here for a second.
- Okay.
- So to your point about how this is the way the system works
and basically the more spending we do,
the more it has to be funded,
the more it's funded and monetized,
that whole circle of spending
and what we might want to consider to be fiscal abuse
to a certain extent.
It manifests an increasingly transferring wealth
from the many to the few, right?
And here's the question I just wrestled with,
which is how do we get out of that?
Like that's the issue I find myself
sort of thinking about late at night is like,
I just wish I had more optimism where I felt like,
oh, well, here are some other options
where that might end, right?
I don't see that many.
I mean, short of the really bad ones,
the system breaking down, the currency failing,
or just civil unrest
where enough people just grab their pitchforks and say,
we're done and they march on the White House, right?
Do you have a different view?
Like I'm looking for optimism here.
- Yeah, no, look,
there are so many things that we could do, right?
Let's take an easy one right now.
One of the big concerns is our social security welfare system.
- But real quick,
let's talk about not just can, but likely, right?
- Yeah, yeah, no, no.
- I got a lot of great things we should be doing,
but I just don't feel like we're going there.
- Well, that's my whole point, right?
We have a choice and it's like with anything.
Look, let's take it from a different perspective, right?
So you're really out of shape.
You haven't taken care of yourself.
You've been overeating, eating for years.
You've been drinking heavily and smoking cigarettes, okay.
Now, you have a couple of choices.
Either you can start by making small changes, right?
So I'm gonna stop smoking,
but I'm still gonna drink and eat too much, right?
And then once I kick my cigarette habit,
then I work on my drinking habit.
And each one of those fixes are very tough to do,
but it's not just this massive life-shattering alteration.
- You're not going culture at the overnight, yeah.
- Correct, you can do that a little bit at a time
and improve your health and make yourself live longer
and have a much better life.
Or you can keep doing that until you wind up
in emergency care in the hospital
and the doctor says, here's your choice.
You either quit drinking, smoking, and overeating today,
or you're gonna die by tomorrow, right?
And all of a sudden you have to go through this massive shift
and this is the same thing in our environment today.
We have choices.
If we could elect, and again, it's not the president.
Get rid of this idea
that the president is gonna fix anything
because he's not the guy.
It's the people in Congress and the Senate.
That's who we should be.
We should be spending our effort
on electing the people in Congress and Senate
that are going to make better decisions
for us as a population, right?
We have 330 people, I'm sorry,
we have 550 people directing the outcome of 330 million.
Elect better people.
And so the point is,
is they could be making small decisions today
to start moving us in the right direction
that would be very less painful.
Yes, we're gonna have to give up a little here,
give up a little over there.
You're not gonna get a check sent to your household.
I'm sorry, in the next recession,
you're gonna have to just suffer through it
with everybody else.
Or at some point, to your point, the bond market, the dollar,
they're gonna fix the problem for you
and it's gonna be amazingly difficult when that happens
'cause now you're talking about the next depression
when that occurs.
And it will occur at some point, that system will break
because it's just simply a function of its own weight.
Now, probably you and I will be dead before that happens,
thankfully, but that's what our future will look like
if we don't start making some changes now.
But nobody in politics wants to actually do that.
- Yeah, so okay, so you're not making me feel any better.
I'll mark this for us to be able to talk about this.
I'm just not seeing signs, even glimmers of green shoots
that we are moving towards
the type of even small incremental
at first reforms that you're talking about.
It really does feel to my eyes that we are gonna,
the only thing that's gonna wake us up is the heart attack.
It's the massive coronary that we hopefully survive
and then we then maybe start listening to the doctor.
- Well, this is because citizens have learned
how to vote themselves a paycheck.
So once you have gotten to the point
where citizens are voting themselves a paycheck,
that is a very difficult thing to change.
- Okay, all right.
All right, sorry for that depressing diversion.
Let's get back on track here.
Okay, gosh, all these could be-
- And none of that has anything to do with today
or the market going up.
- Well, yeah, not with today today, but all right.
So I wanna talk about the reverse repo program, the BTFP.
For those that have not seen it,
I just wanna give a plug for the video
that just came out before this one with Dave Bianco.
I highly recommend you watch that one.
And actually, if you wanna understand
how these programs really work,
watch the video that came out before the Bianco one
with Andy Constant, where he spends a lot of time
just sort of talking about how the plumbing
of both those programs work.
But the reverse repo facility continues to see drawdowns
at its current pace.
It's looking to zero out by about March.
And Bianco and others, I think, are really beginning to say,
this may be why the Fed changed its tune
and surprised everybody.
Beginning of December,
we're not even thinking about rate cuts.
And then all of a sudden, two weeks later,
hey folks, rate cuts coming, get ready.
And Dave and I talk a fair amount about his reasons why.
But basically it comes down to the fact
that the reverse repo programs are a form of tightening.
But when you're doing less tightening,
when you're draining that program down,
it actually acts as easing.
And that has been a big cushion so far
against the quantitative tightening that's happened
and even to a certain extent, the rate cuts.
And there's been other spending out there,
the deficit spending that Lance was talking about
and a whole bunch of other things
that have been pushing liquidity up too.
But this has been a pretty big factor.
And the concern is that once that's drained,
like we haven't really been feeling the bite of QT
because we've had this offsetting program going on.
Once that gets drained, if it does indeed get drained,
then we really start to feel the bite of QT.
And presumably it's the kind of mental calculation
of how bad that bite would actually feel to the economy,
which has got the Fed saying, shoot,
we're worried about that.
But anyways, Lance,
so I just wanted to get your thoughts on this.
- So not surprisingly,
that is actually the subject of this weekend's newsletter
on the website at realinvestmentadvice.com.
As you always do, always generally ask me questions
about stuff I've already written something on.
- Just to be clear, I just mentioned things
and you have written on all of them.
- Yeah, well, so this weekend's newsletter
is going through exactly this,
is that you got two things that are going on right now.
So you have the draining of the repo,
reverse repos are getting drained.
At the same time in March, the bank term funding program
that was the backstop for regional banks last year,
that also ends.
And I can see the Fed letting the bank term funding program
end because it's no longer being used
for the purpose that it was meant for.
It's now being gained by the banks.
So the banks- - It's being abused.
I have the stats here.
Yeah, and it's just gone crazy.
Keep talking, I'm going to pull up a chart
of how it's been used 'cause you can see
that now that folks realize that it's just free money,
it's going through the roof.
- And see, this is the problem with all this stuff, right?
Is that when we do these things,
the markets are very smart and they go,
"Hey, wait a minute.
You mean I can borrow with this and I can loan at that
and I can pick up the arbitrage in between?
I'll do that."
And that's how they make money.
So they figured out how to make money
with this BTFP program and have been arbitraging the crap
out of it ever since this thing really kind of started.
And there's the chart for you.
- Yeah, look at that green shade.
You can see that's where word got out
on how sweet a deal this was.
And then everybody just started borrowing from it.
- So not surprising at all, right?
And so I can see them letting that program in
because it's not being done anything,
but the reverse repo is a different issue.
And I think we talked about this previously on the show,
but just a quick recap.
If you go back to 2018, in September of 2018,
the Fed was hiking rates, much like we're doing now.
And the Fed said, "Hey, we're nowhere near the neutral rate."
And that freaked the markets out
because the Fed's tightening hiking interest rates.
We were doing basically a QT at the time.
And so the markets started freaking out.
We were down by 20% over the next couple of months.
And by December, the Fed hadn't hiked rates anymore,
come December.
But in December, Donald Trump is threatening
to fire Jerome Powell and all this markets are down 20%.
And so Jerome Powell says,
"Oh, we're a lot closer to the neutral rate than we thought."
I mean, just this complete 180.
And then by June, they actually started cutting rates.
And then by September,
they're engaged in these massive reverse repo operations
to bail out the banking system.
Now, we didn't really have an idea
of what was going on at the time,
but there was all kinds of recessionary indicators
that were going on.
We had inverted yield curves,
the NFIB was signaling all kinds of recessionary signals out.
Everything was telling us a recession was coming
and we were just months away from a recession.
And then the trigger, the catalyst,
the match that lit the fuse
was basically shutting down the economy because of pandemic,
just threw everything into a recession.
So, but we had plenty of clues
that something was wrong in the system.
And so here we are today, very similarly,
the Fed's hiking rates and all of a sudden in two weeks,
they go, well, we're nowhere near the neutral rate,
but now we actually really are two weeks later.
And now we're starting to talk about rate cuts
and potentially ending QT and restarting QE later this year.
It just tells you that there's some financial stress.
There's some fractures in the financial system somewhere
that we may not actually see,
but we have inverted yield curves.
We have economic data that's telling us a recession
is potential, we have a potential for a recession.
You know, we talked, I think it was last week,
we talked about, you know, having the tender and the logs
and everything built to make sure we just needed a match.
We're just waiting on the match.
What that match is gonna be, we have no idea,
but everything is there.
And I think what the, you know,
what's going on with this reverse repo system
and what's happening with the banks.
And, you know, it's just telling us
that there's a lot more fragility to the system
than what the markets think.
And the markets are rallying up at this point,
not really paying attention to the risk,
but I think there's a lot more risks there.
- Yeah, and the market's priced in,
I wanna say not even six,
I think seven rate cuts for next year.
I mean, it's just like on crack.
- Yeah.
- So, you know, so what's interesting about this,
and I'm glad you mentioned the recent discussion
that QT itself is potentially gonna end by like end of Q1,
'cause that's a new rumor that's going around right now.
And when, you know,
Powell had his surprise revelation at the press conference,
you were out that week,
Mike Leibowitz was here with me recapping it.
And, you know, we talked about this and like I said, yeah,
you know, either the Fed really believes this stuff
that it's gonna achieve the immaculate disinflation
and it's gonna have a baby soft landing.
And yeah, now's the time to start cutting
'cause you don't wanna wait
until you get down to 2% inflation.
He said, or it's spooked by something
that it's not telling us.
And it seems now as more and more of this stuff
begins to become a little clearer,
probably it was the latter.
That the Fed probably was freaked out about something.
- Yeah, and again, you know, you have to end QT
if you're gonna rebuild the repo operations.
So, you know, you can't keep draining that liquidity
from the system if you're having to provide liquidity system.
So that's why, you know, that's why now everybody's going,
okay, yeah, QT is gonna end sooner than later.
Could be March, could be June,
but sometime within the first half of this year,
we'll probably be back towards, you know,
initially it'll just stop QT,
but I won't be surprised that shortly after that,
that they start increasing the balance sheet again.
- Okay, and if it does, it just proves that, you know,
we're never gonna normalize the balance sheet.
- No, no, and again, like we said before,
if the government's gonna keep spending
the way that they're spending money,
the Fed's gonna have to monetize up to 30% of that.
So there's no way you're gonna normalize the balance sheet,
and what is normal, right?
You have to remember the normal balance sheet
was 330 million free 2008, right?
And so, you know, when you're talking about trillions
upon trillions of dollars, we're nowhere near normal.
- Okay, my recollection, it was 800 billion.
- I'm sorry, it's 330 billion, I said million.
It was 330 billion, then it went to 800 billion.
But yeah, now we're getting to trillions.
So normalize, you know, back to even the billion dollar
range, right, just let's get back to a billion.
- Oh yeah, never gonna happen, right?
Remember the whole, oh, it's gonna be so boring.
It's gonna be like watching paint dry, right?
Just all that stuff is just lies, right?
Just like, well, maybe back then, I'm willing to say,
maybe back then it was naivete.
Now it's just gonna be lies if they ever tell you, you know,
oh, no, no, no, don't worry, we're gonna,
we gotta monetize today, but boy, we're gonna get rid
of this later on, just come on, yeah.
- No, and you know, it's just, and again, you know,
I've written the articles on this recently
about how the market has now been trained by the Fed,
you know, like the Pavlovian response of, you know,
Pavlov on the dog, training the bell, is that,
in the end, it's one of the markets are rallying so hard
is that they rang the bell.
They said, hey, rate cuts are coming in QE,
that means buy stocks.
- Yeah, all right, look, we can talk about this forever.
One last point on the bank term funding program.
So in the conversation I had with Andy Constant about this,
you know, I asked him, hey, how worried should we be
about this expiration, right?
'Cause it does look like it's probably gonna be ended.
And he said, I'm not that worried.
And the main reason why he said he wasn't that worried,
because, I mean, what I was asking is, look,
a lot of the assets that were impaired at the banks
that the rescue operation was designed to help get off
their books for a year, they're in even worse shape
right now with, you know, yields are higher now
than they were back then in March of last year.
So are these banks ready to reabsorb these bad assets?
And he said, well, look, not entirely sure
what's gonna happen, but he said,
what could certainly be done is the banks can just,
the very last day of the BTFP program,
it's a one year lending program.
They can just go back and re-loan everything
and they can buy themselves another year.
So basically, who knows what's gonna happen,
but to me, that feels like something that if it's available,
yeah, why wouldn't the banks just do that and say,
yeah, this has been good.
We'll just set the ticker for another year
and we'll worry about this a year from now.
- Yeah, look, if there's any,
you're gonna know very quickly.
So come March when this program ends,
if the Fed renews it for another year,
you know there's a lot of problem with the banks.
- Well, I don't know if they necessarily have to renew it
for a year, but it's when you borrow from the program,
it's a year borrowing.
- Right, no, yes, correct.
- Oh, but you're saying if they do extend it,
then that's a strong sign.
- Yeah, if they come up at the end of this period, say,
'cause again, we know the banks
are just gaining the system now, right?
- Right.
- And look, the regional banks are doing okay,
we haven't had any more failures, everything's fine so far,
but that's what I'm saying is that all of a sudden,
if the Fed says, oh yeah, we're gonna push that,
we're just gonna let that program run
for another 12 months or so,
that's just telling you that there's more problems
with those regional banks because of the delinquencies,
et cetera, than what they're telling us.
But again, remember Credit Suisse passed
the Fed stress test as they were being absorbed by UBS, so.
- Yep, exactly, yeah, the Fed gives you a pass
and that and the five bucks probably won't even buy you
a Starbucks coffee.
All right, I need your lightning round answer on this one.
- Yes, sir, two words.
So one of the things that Bianco and I talked
a fair amount about was his concerns,
and I'm using him as a proxy because a lot of people
I've talked about recently share these concerns,
that inflation may very well surprise to the upside
later this year.
And I know your partner, Mike Liebowitz,
just wrote a piece that says,
will we have another sort of 1970s style resurgence
of inflation?
How worried are you guys at RIA about that?
- Not.
- Not, okay.
- He said lightning round answer,
do you want me to actually explain it?
- Explain it in 60 seconds, but yeah.
- Okay, you'll see an uptick in inflation,
but you're not gonna go back to seeing the nine and 10,
11% rates that we saw previously,
because we don't have the economic capacity for it.
Debt is disinflationary,
the more debt we add on is more deflationary.
You don't have the manufacturing backdrop,
services are slowing down.
So all the money that we inject into the system
that created the inflation to start with,
that's leaving the system.
So without, now, if you send checks to households,
you got another big surge inflation.
But in the short term,
if we see a pickup in economic activity,
you're gonna see an uptick in inflation
because inflation tracks economic activity.
Yields will track inflation, which tracks economic activity.
- Right, and what if we see economic activity pick up?
I mean, it's measured by GDP.
It's still not doing that bad.
But to your point, let's say it ticks up,
but what if it ticks up at a point
where the Fed is cutting and ending QT?
That would be more inflationary, right?
- No, if economic activity,
so economic activity is running about 2%
for the fourth quarter, right?
So we average analyzed last year,
we're probably running close to three.
So if you say, well, economic growth
is gonna be 4% this year,
then inflation is gonna be about 4%.
So you'd see a pickup in inflation from three to 4%.
That's what you should expect.
Yields should be between four and a half percent
in that environment.
- But just to be clear, if the Fed does make good on,
hey, we're actually gonna do three rate cuts next year
and end QT, whatever, doesn't that potentially suggest
it could be even more inflationary?
- No, because rate cuts and QE
as a function are disinflationary.
If you go back and look at inflation
during the 2009 through 2020,
before we started going crazy with checks and households,
inflation ran close to 2%.
Economic growth was close to 2%.
And yields were basically depending on the maturity
between zero and 3%.
So all those are gonna be aligned to some form and fashion.
Now they're gonna go up and down based on economic activity,
but Fed rate cuts does not translate into economic activity.
- Okay, all right, oh, God.
- Because you're not, look, quantitative easing,
this is the big mistake that everybody makes.
All quantitative easing is,
is an asset swap between the banks and the Fed.
That's it, right?
There's no-
- Now it does creep into financial assets,
so we can have that discussion, but it's-
- But yes, it creeps into financial assets
because the banks then loan the money to the hedge funds,
blah, blah, blah,
loan the reserves to the hedge funds, et cetera.
But it doesn't create money supply
and it doesn't get to the household.
So you don't get increased economic activity inflation
from QE because it never gets to the household.
- Right, but rate, you said rate cuts aren't inflationary.
I mean, rate cuts theoretically stimulate the economy,
get spending going, all that type of stuff.
- Not really, no, because when the, because again,
and actually there's a chart in the article today
on the website.
Here, let me see if I can just find it for you real quick.
I'll just show you, one second.
- All right, no worries.
Yeah, I just, we're gonna have to put it,
once you pull up your chart,
we're gonna have to put a pin in this
'cause this is an important and interesting discussion,
but just one that deserves way more time
than have to get fit with the other things
I'm trying to get through before we wrap up.
- Hang on, here, hold on.
Let me just share this real quick here.
So this is federal surplus deficit economic growth.
So obviously the more deficits you have,
hold on, back up real quick.
So during this period from 2008 to 2020,
so that big spike right here on the end,
that's the 20 COVID bailout.
So you can look at over that period ahead of that,
that whole period where we were increasing the debt,
that's also when we're doing QE,
that's also when we have zero interest rates,
economic growth was flat.
It just, and this is nominal by the way, this is not real.
Inflation just, so it's just nominal GDP growth.
So we just kind of rolled along
at about 3% nominal growth for a decade.
And so we never saw that.
Now during that same period,
remember interest rates were zero by the Fed.
And as, and again, there's no historical correlation
between bigger deficits leading to higher interest rates
or Fed cuts leading to higher interest rates,
because again, that's all a function of economic activity.
So again, when we come back and we look at all these things
about what went on,
even all this monetary spending that we did
all during 2008, 2009, just this massive spending growth
never actually translated to economic activity.
Only during that COVID spike did we get inflation
and a pop in economic activity.
And now that's rolling off again.
So we spent $43 trillion and all this money
from the government, the Fed, QE, all this
to get 5.7 trillion of economic growth.
There's not a translation between QE,
economic growth, inflation, and interest rates.
- Okay, fascinating.
All right, I want to dig more into that,
but like I said, I got to put a pin in it.
All right, so RIA is saying we're not that worried
about inflation resurging later this year.
- No, no, no, no, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, back that up.
- Okay.
- No, we think inflation will tick back up,
but it's not going to 9%.
So we just have to be clear about,
are you talking about a resurgence of inflation
back to double digit levels are going from three to 4%.
Three to 4%, very likely that's going to happen
depending what happens economically.
- In five, six?
- Probably not, probably not.
- Okay, all right, okay.
God, I want to dig into that, but we got to move on.
All right.
- Next week, we'll do the fallacy of QE next week.
- Okay, again, lightning round,
'cause I want to get to a couple of quick things
as we wrap up.
Bond yields continuing to creep back up here.
Anything to comment on about this or just sort of-
- No, kind of what we said before,
which is that we expected bond yields
to creep up to about four, four and a quarter percent.
Doing exactly, look, the stock market
in November, December got extremely overbought.
Bonds got extremely overbought short-term.
Everybody was piling into bonds all of a sudden.
It was like, all of last year, nobody wanted to own a bond.
And then at the end of the year, everybody wanted to buy one.
So everybody jumped into bonds, bonds got very overbought.
And just like everything else,
we're just going through that corrective phase,
four, four and a quarter percent, still kind of our target.
And again, once we kind of get to that level,
we're starting to work off that big overbought condition
and probably somewhere in the next month or so,
we'll have a good entry point
to add to bond exposure for the shift.
- Okay, great.
So as you begin to see that entry point emerge,
looking forward to you letting us know
on these weekly programs, yeah.
- I'll let you know after I buy my position.
- Okay.
(laughs)
- So we got a ridiculously low jobless claims report
that just came out.
It was the second lowest level reading
that we've had since May, 1969, right?
So what was it?
Something like 187,000 jobless claims were filled.
Is this something we should really take note of
or is this just a factor of weather
that cold weather people couldn't go out there
and make their claims and don't freak out about it
or I shouldn't say freak out,
but don't place a lot of weight on this
until we see more data?
- No, no, I would, look, yes, that's partly true.
The kind of polar vortex, keep people inside those,
we'll probably see a pop in claims next week.
But there was a really interesting video out
earlier this week and it had like a million views on it.
And so I had to go,
I went to watch this more and the video is this young kid
and he's like, and you and I have talked about
the job opening labor turnover survey
and there's something wrong with all that data that says,
oh, there's all these job openings
and yet we have employment being a very different story.
And so he talks about how he sent out 1,400 resumes
through LinkedIn and Indeed
and all these different recruiting services.
He's just sending out tons of resumes.
- 1,400?
- 1,400 and he said, he got a job
and the only reason he got a job previously
was because the hiring manager,
they went to school together.
So that's how he got into the door.
And of course, people are telling him like,
oh, we have to do cold emails.
He's like, look, I've done cold emails, hot emails,
medium rare emails, I've called, I've done everything.
Not able to get a job.
And so I go, well, probably something wrong with you.
So I said, well, let's go look at some of the comments.
And again, this thing has like a million views.
So there's thousands upon thousands of comments
on this video.
The vast majority was like, yeah, same problem.
Sending out resumes, not getting a bite.
And so, and look, this is all anecdotal.
I'm not saying this is scientific survey
by any stretch of the imagination,
but this has been my suspicion for a while
about jobless claims as well as job openings.
Companies aren't laying off people, right?
We're not seeing big terminations
because companies only hired back the employees
they fired during the pandemic.
In fact, there's a really great analysis out
that was out this morning.
You know, President Biden's claiming,
oh, I created 14 million jobs since I've been in office
through the first 31 months, whatever.
Actually, if you strip out all the jobs that were lost,
that came back, he's created like 400,000,
like 300,000 manufacturing jobs,
like a total of 2 million jobs have been created
during his tenure as president.
And so what that tells you is that companies
have hired back what they want,
but they're not hiring a lot of excess.
So as things slow down, there's not this big need
to lay off a ton of people 'cause they never overhired
coming out of that recessionary downturn we had in 2020.
So if I'm not firing a lot of people,
there's not a lot of jobless claims.
But that also means that,
and we talked about this before with job openings,
restaurants always have job openings, right?
I've always got an opening at my restaurant
for four wait staff and a hostess, right?
'Cause they quit all the damn time to go somewhere else.
So those jobs are just perpetually out there.
It doesn't mean I'm hiring for them.
And so when I get resumes in,
I'll just put them on file and we sit on them.
We always have job openings at our company, right?
If you're a financial advisor,
you've got a book of business and you've got your CFP,
we'd love to talk to you, right?
We are always looking for new advisors
to add to our platform and to our company
'cause we're always in need of that
because of servicing our customers.
But just because we're always hiring
doesn't mean we're hiring today, this minute, right?
We have to have a need and financing and all this.
So again, a lot of companies have openings
that doesn't necessarily mean they're hiring.
And that's that dispersion that we're seeing
between the data and initial claims,
as well as job openings of what's happening
kind of on the ground floor of the economy.
- Got it, and I can say anecdotally,
I know a few kind of bright, shiny, younger adults
who are out there trying to get their first job
and just not having success.
I mean, these are high pedigree candidates
and they're doing everything.
They're not just sending emails, they're networking,
they're showing up with custom handwritten,
I really want to work here stuff.
And again, super anecdotal,
but it supports what you're saying.
All right.
- Oh, good.
- No, I was going to move on.
So if you have anything else to say.
- Go ahead, it's not working.
- All right, so I need literally
your like real lightning round answers
on these two next things.
The Chinese stock market, it's really falling pretty hard.
Rumors that they're calling
in the plunge protection team there now.
Main question is just, and by the way, not for nothing too.
China's population just declined
for the second year in a row, right?
We're used to it being this huge growth juggernaut,
but its demographics are starting
to catch up with it as well.
Any expected blowback in the markets from this,
from China's capital markets struggling?
- You would have kind of thought
that would have happened by now if it was going to happen,
right?
You would have seen a big roll off in tech
or the markets here.
And I think what's happening, again,
I'm not saying that that won't eventually happen.
You know, because there is a correlation
between Chinese market liquidity
and liquidity to the global markets as well.
So there is something we're paying attention to.
If China starts stepping in
and starts bailing out their markets,
that should benefit us.
I'm surprised that we haven't seen
a bigger drawdown in tech here,
the reason I think that's the case
is because money's hiding in U.S. tech stocks.
U.S. tech stocks are easy and they're highly liquid.
They're very safe and are perceived to be
a form of safe haven for capital.
So if I can't, if I'm supposed to have money
in Chinese tech and I don't want to be there,
I'm putting it in U.S. tech theoretically
as a place to hide.
So I think we're seeing a lot of that flow push
into U.S. tech, people hiding there
because of what's happening in China.
Just in theory, I don't have any proof of that.
- All right, all right.
Kind of like what we've seen out here on the U.S. West Coast
where our real estate markets have been,
one of the things that's been pushing them
to these crazy levels has been capital flight from China.
And these guys are price insensitive
because they're like, look, even if,
I don't care if I'm buying into a housing bubble,
if it corrects by 50%,
at least I got 50% of my money out, right?
So you're saying it was almost a similar thing
going on with U.S. tech.
- Okay, I just want to note this
because we've touched upon it in the past.
You haven't seemed particularly nervous about it,
but it is continuing to heat up versus cool off.
And so I just want to note where it is,
but looking to the Middle East,
the situation there just, again, continues to get hotter.
We've now have U.S. and the UK
striking 60-plus targets, Houthi targets in Yemen.
They've been lobbing these drones
at the shipping fleets, right?
So that's going on.
Iran and Pakistan just exchanged missile fire
and Jordan just bombed Syria.
So it's just getting more and more unstable.
Who knows where it's going to go.
Hopefully things quiet down.
Just want to give you a chance to just say,
is this catching your attention at all?
Are you still not that worried?
- I'm not worried, I'm not.
Look, when it comes down to this,
am I personally worried about the environment
that we live in, the geopolitical risk
that potentially could affect our lives here?
Yeah, of course, who wouldn't be?
One of the greatest tweets I saw all week long
was this exchange between the Houthis and the U.S. Navy.
There was a tweet out and it says,
"You don't mess with Taco Tuesday."
Of course, the U.S. Navy just decimated
a bunch of Houthi ships, so Houthi targets.
And the taco was signed, the USS Enterprise,
and the tweet came from the captain of the Enterprise.
So it's just basically the Navy's not worried
about this at all.
But anyway, I'm definitely worried
about the escalation of that, but the markets don't care.
What's interesting, we're not seeing a big,
we added some energy exposure earlier this year
as this escalation started on expectations.
We would see potentially a pickup in energy prices
because of this.
It's not really happening.
Energy stocks are hanging in there,
but they're not participating.
We expected a lot more.
We also own companies like Raytheon Technologies,
which build missiles and all kinds of weaponry
for these type of events.
And those stocks are doing okay,
but certainly not what you would expect
that there was real concern about this escalating
into a much bigger thing.
Maybe that still comes,
but kind of from a stock market perspective,
which is what you're asking me,
the market isn't overly concerned about that
because the areas that should be benefiting the most
if there is this rising risk of war
should be doing a whole lot better than they are.
So the market is not concerned
about this escalating at all.
- Okay.
I'm debating whether to mention this.
I guess I'm gonna try to squeak it in.
If we can't, we'll just push it to next week.
But I wanted to let folks know
about the Corporate Transparency Act.
Has that been on your radar at all, Lance?
- Yes.
- This is like coming out of nowhere for most people.
- This is stupid, but go ahead.
- So basically, if you're a business,
practically any business,
you have to file this new Corporate Transparency Act.
And there are pretty serious repercussions
if you don't file for it.
Brand new, it just started allowing filings.
At the beginning of this year,
you've got the entire year to file this thing.
But if you are one of the 30 million business owners
who's gonna have to file,
this should be on your radar if it's not.
And this basically, presumptively,
you identify, okay, I'm a business.
This is who I am.
I am here in America.
And it's basically trying to weed out like money launderers
and stuff like that.
It's not trying to?
- No, that's the reason they gave you.
- That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying.
Presumptively, that's why they're saying
it's supposed to do it.
- That's not why they're doing it.
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, I mean, it's basically just creating
another big data registry to be looked at.
- No, they're going with this.
Okay, so first of all, you just threw out a stat,
30 million business owners.
How many of those business owners have employees?
- A lot of them don't.
- Sorry?
- I said a lot of them don't.
- Yeah, 6 million of 30 have actual employees.
So 24 million have no employees whatsoever.
What are those for?
Why do I have 24 million businesses that have no employees?
What are they doing?
- Sole proprietorships or?
- No, they are trusts.
They are LLCs for housing real estate assets.
They are a grantor trust.
They are special needs trust.
They are a state trust.
They are for all kinds of asset protection
and estate planning issues.
That's what they're for.
Like for myself, I have a whole LLC, has no employees.
All it does is house assets.
That's what it does, right?
And so for instance, I may have,
if I have like 10 rental properties,
I've got 10 LLCs I own 100% of
that each own a real estate property.
So under this act, if you own more than 25% of the business,
you have to register.
So if I own a trust with a bunch of assets in it
and I'm the government,
I want to know where all these assets are
that are theoretically hidden at the moment
because they're behind these protection walls.
This makes me disclose who owns all those assets.
- Yep. Yeah.
Well, that's sort of what I was saying about it.
It's creating this big registry for, you know,
basically greater government.
- The government is wanting to know where your assets are
and who owns them.
- And, and, and so-
- And it's also unconstitutional, but other than that.
- Other than that, yeah.
And we could rant about this and if we want to rant,
let's rant next time on it.
But I just wanted to make folks aware of this
because if you own an LLC like this,
that Lance is saying, or sole proprietorship or whatever,
right, you've got to report this
and there's pretty big penalties if you don't.
The only thing I'll say is two things.
One, like, you know, any government program,
it can be abused.
I think we've already probably put the ideas
in the minds of people of why this is maybe a scary thing
from a, you know, transparency and government
being all up in your grill standpoint.
But already there is reports
that FinCEN is flagging transactions
according to kind of people's political persuasion,
this looking for keywords and things like this.
So it already seems to be getting sort of abused
for political purposes already.
And then when I went to their website today,
it said that FinCEN has been notified
of recent fraudulent attempts to solicit information
from folks, basically, you know,
scammers pretending to be FinCEN
and saying we need this information,
give us all your information, right,
and then taking that information
and basically trying to get your answers.
- Amazing, amazing that would happen.
- Amazing that would happen, right.
- If you shop at Cabela's or you shop at Bass Pro Shop
or you search keywords of MAGA or Trump,
yeah, you're on the radar.
- Yeah, so anyways, where I'm going with this is,
it's not good.
Again, maybe Lance, maybe we can dedicate some time
in a future video here to really dig into this for folks.
And probably get a good rant on.
But to the extent that you think you may be
one of the people that has to comply with this,
go to FinCEN.gov, that's the website.
You can find more details there.
And if you do have to register,
you have to register by the end of 2024.
Or again, like I said,
those pretty stiff penalties start to kick in.
All right, in wrapping things,
beginning to wrap things up here,
first, some really good news for folks.
Got a lot of real kind support from people
as I was studying for that securities exam.
Took it yesterday, passed it.
So I can breathe a sigh of relief, get that off my brain.
It's gonna unlock some of the final big things
for what we want to be able to offer to folks
through thoughtful money.
And you'll see and hear more about that pretty soon
as I get the final approval from the securities authorities
and be able to get green-lighted
to do some of the things I want to do.
But I want to thank everybody again for your kind wishes.
And also super excited for the mental bandwidth
that's getting freed up
by not having to study for that test anymore.
All right, Lance, I want to get to
our little rant/human interest topic this week.
And I think this one's gonna be right in your wheelhouse.
So one of the reasons why I pushed forward
with studying for the securities exam
when it came at a completely inconvenient time,
both in terms of all the transition of moving away
from my previous company to founding thoughtful money,
to my father passing away last month,
and just a lot on my plate,
but I had to keep persevering to pass this thing.
And what drove me to do that was the bigger picture, right?
Super inconvenient, super painful in a lot of ways
to have to just keep grinding away at that.
But the important thing was is
I knew what I was doing it for, right?
And this comes down to the topic of today's rant,
which is the importance of knowing your why, right?
If you know why you are,
what you're shooting for and why you're going for it,
that is sort of like the key element
of the mental fortitude that's going to actually see you
through to realize your goal.
We talk a lot in the past about grit and dedication
and commitment and learning how to persevere
through adversity and all that type of stuff.
But the number one thing that researchers say
that make people successful in doing that
is having a really clearly defined why.
And maybe you've read the books by guys like Simon Sinek,
know your why, and that's how you achieve personal goals
and business goals and all that stuff.
But the best visualization of this that I've seen
is there was a TV series.
It was just a one season series back in 2016, I think,
called "The Selection."
Do you ever see that, Lance?
- I did not.
- So "The Selection," it's a reality show.
And what it is is it's like an accelerated
special forces program.
So it's designed by Green Berets, Navy Seals, Army Rangers,
and they basically put out a casting call and they said,
"Hey, think you're tough?
Think you've got what it takes
to make it through special forces training?
Come show up at our place here.
If we accept you, it's a very stringent screening program,
we're gonna end up with like 40 of you,
and we're gonna put you guys through this hyper-condensed,
hyper-intense version of special forces,
and we'll see how many of you come out the other side."
And Lance, this was just the most brutal abuse
that these guys went through.
And what was interesting is it was kind of divided
into three waves.
The first wave was to see, okay,
so let's just weed out the people
who aren't physically tough enough, right?
So it was just like horrific, multiple times a day,
just feats of endurance and strength,
and just beating on these people,
exhausting them physically,
and then waking them up an hour later
and having them do it all over again.
The second phase was weeding out the people
who weren't mentally tough enough.
So this was the sleep deprivation.
They capture some of these guys at some point
and put them through sort of like mock torture,
waterboarding, stuff like this.
And they just try to beat these people down
emotionally and mentally.
And then whoever's left after that,
then they kind of grind them
through the rest of the program.
And lo and behold, I think it's something like
three people out of the 40 or whatever
make it through at the end.
But what they show you through this,
'cause they're doing interviews along the way
with the folks that are getting abused
and trying to determine
if they're going to stick in the program or not,
the key thing is those that had the clearest why
for why they were doing this and why they were there,
those were the guys that made it through to the end.
They had a very strong sense of
what they were trying to get out of it,
why it was an important part of their identity,
why it was important to them.
And that was what kept them going
when they were locked in a box in the dark
with water dripping on them,
they hadn't eaten in three days, right?
So one of the things that stood out to be the most
in that series was the fact that
if you looked at the candidates on day one
and you said, all right, I'm going to try to predict
who's going to make it through here,
really easy to go look at the really big beefy guys
who just looked really tough, both physically and mentally,
they just seemed like the most aggressive and focused,
and did really discount the smaller, more wiry guys,
or in many cases, a lot of the women,
compared to these big hulking guys.
And in almost every case, you'd have been wrong.
It just shows that kind of the size of the package
doesn't really matter when it comes down to
having the ability to just persevere through misery.
And what really does instead is it's the why.
So it's a fascinating series,
really great sort of deep dive into
the amount of abuse that the human body can take.
But again, really, what is it that gets us
through extreme adversity?
So anyways, anyone who's interested,
I'll put a link to the selection down below
in the description of this video here.
If you've got time next week or whatever,
you're looking for something interesting to watch
that doesn't take too much time.
I think it's like eight episodes.
Really pretty fascinating.
And so, again, I know this is sort of a bit of a world
that you're familiar with, Lance,
but we talk a lot about a lot of the behaviors
that people should engage in.
I want to make sure we really underline
this point about the why.
In fact, it's almost the thing you should start with,
right, just to say, if I want to be better,
if I want to go through some sort of metamorphosis
or transformation, I better be real clear at the beginning,
why I'm doing it.
Because if I'm not, I'm going to get knocked off
in this journey by the pain, the uncertainty,
the unpleasantness, or whatever of it.
You're nodding as I'm saying all this.
- Yeah, well, no, I mean, it's with anything, right?
You can take an alcoholic as an example
and you can force them into rehab,
but it's not going to work.
They have to reach the point
that they want to fix the problem.
They've got to say, I've got to do this for me to do this.
That's the why, right?
Why am I going to put myself through this agonizing pain,
whether it's trying to become a Navy SEAL
or just trying to lose weight, right?
Those all require a dedication to reaching that goal.
And if you're not fully committed to it,
if you don't understand why you're doing it,
the first time it gets tough, you're going to say,
okay, well, I'm done, I'm going to-
- Right, because we're humans.
We have those voices in our head that say, this sucks, right?
You know, quit, you're hungry, go get the pizza,
or running is no fun, just stop, right?
I mean, you're going to have all this pressure
to capitulate, right?
- Yeah, exactly.
So, I mean, but that's, again,
this goes with everything in life,
whether it's your job, your business.
Again, we've talked about starting a business
and people complain about capitalism,
how capitalism is broken, which is absolutely not true.
You can go out and start a business today
and be one of those 30 million business owners
you have to report your information on.
But anybody can go start a business,
but you better damn well know why you're doing it,
because it's not easy.
It takes a tremendous amount of work, you've got a risk,
you've got to sacrifice, you're going to work late hours,
you're going to have to do stuff all the time
that you just don't want to do.
And that's just part of running and operating a business.
So you better be well understanding what my goal
or what my objective is before you even start,
because otherwise the first time you will fail,
and you will fail,
there's no doubt that you're going to fail along the way,
things are not going to work, you're going to hit hurdles,
things are not going to work out the way you thought,
and you're going to quit.
And you're going, I'll just go back,
I'll go back to working nine to five.
And that's okay, there's nothing wrong with that,
but the difference between those who succeed
and those who don't are those that are willing
to have fortitude and go through that pain
and come out the other side of it.
- Yeah, it's that whole like,
it's not how many times you get knocked down,
it's how many times you get back up,
and what forces you to get back up,
what enables you to get back up, is that why, right?
Is that I haven't achieved this yet,
I know what I need to do, I know why I'm doing it,
I can't lay down here, if it's going to happen,
I got to get back up and try to make this thing happen.
So I think my counsel here to people would be look,
I think in general,
people don't do nearly as much goal setting as they should.
And when you set a goal,
you should try to make it a SMART goal, right?
And what is SMART, specific, measurable, actionable,
realistic, and time-bound?
I think that's what it stands for.
If you're going to make a goal, make it a SMART goal.
But even then, SMART goals, they need a why, right?
So I guess I just recommend anybody listening
to this interview right now is if you,
maybe take a moment today, five minutes over coffee,
and just try to identify one to three important goals
in your life, right?
They don't have to be business goals,
but important goals in your life
that you want to make progress on in 2024.
Yeah, if you can write SMART goals for them,
absolutely great, that's the extra credit.
But I think the key assignment here
is just to really just clarify your why.
Can you write a why for each one of those ones?
That's just a short sentence.
And if you can, try to share it with somebody
and just really crystallize it in your mind.
- Yeah, and again, to your point,
I mean, we all set New Year's resolutions
and they always fail quickly.
It's like, "Go to the gym."
I hate going to the gym in the first two weeks of the year
'cause it's jam-packed with people.
By the end of the month, it's completely empty again.
So that's just the way New Year's resolutions work.
But that's because they don't have a obtainable goal.
It's unrealistic.
I'm gonna lose 50 pounds this year.
That's not realistic.
I'm gonna lose two pounds this month.
That's realistic, right?
That's where you wanna work on your goals
is make them short-term, make them obtainable
so that you have, you have a big goal, right?
My goal is to lose 50 overall,
but I'm gonna lose two pounds this month
or this week or whatever it is,
but make them small goals so that you constantly
have success that you can build on.
And to move forward, one of the greatest things
that I make my children watch is this guy
who's a Navy commander for the SEALs.
And he's like, "The first thing you do every morning
is make your bed.
And the first thing you do when you're in SEAL training,
you get up in the morning, 4 a.m.,
first thing you do is make your bed
because you've already achieved something for the day.
And if you can just do that, set small goals,
achieve those every day,
you're gonna succeed over the long term."
- Yeah, we're back at the atomic habits,
which we've talked about the past couple of times.
So again, I continue to totally recommend that.
But just to underscore what you're saying there,
which is, "Here's your resolution,
I'm gonna go to the gym," right?
That fails with so many people because that's a how, right?
It's not a why, right?
It's not even a what, right?
The why is like, "I wanna be healthier,"
or, "I wanna look better," right?
Or, "I wanna feel better,"
or, "I don't wanna die of some sickness," right?
And then the how becomes,
"Okay, I need to get my weight down to this level," right?
Or, "I need to get to this level of physical capability,"
right?
And then the how becomes,
"All right, well then that means I gotta be in the gym
at least three times a week doing these exercises," right?
Or, "I need to lose those two pounds per week
that you're talking about," right?
So I think it's really important to really understand,
a how isn't the motivator, right?
It's the why, right?
And if you're relying on the how to motivate you,
you're gonna fail.
It's just not designed to, right?
All right, okay.
So let's start wrapping up here.
A reminder for folks,
the Thoughtful Money Conference is coming up
in just a little bit,
well, actually just a little bit under two months now.
So a reminder that's gonna be Saturday, March 16th.
If you can't make the live event,
we'll have replay videos of the entire event
that will go out to everybody within 24 hours.
All the details of the event are coming.
I don't have them to share with you just yet.
I will have them by next week.
But I do wanna remind folks too,
that we will be having a lot of discounts that we offer
price-wise in advance of the actual date itself.
There'll be an early bird price.
There'll be a last chance to save price
before it jumps up to the full price.
And that anyone who is a premium subscriber
to my sub stack over at adamtagert.substack.com,
you'll get 50%, sorry, an additional $50
off each one of those discount prices.
So your very low price premium membership
acts as a pretty juicy discount card to the conference
and any other things that thoughtful money might do
in the future that may cost money.
All right, and if you're why in life
for getting out of bed in the morning
is watching these weekly market recaps
with Lance and I every weekend,
please show your support for that by hitting the like button
then clicking on the red subscribe button below,
as well as that little bell icon right next to it.
Lance, as usual, I'll give you the last word.
- I don't know, but if you're a why on Saturday mornings
to get to watch this video, you need a different why.
(laughing)
- Come on, there's no higher use of people's time
than watching this.
- No, it was actually very interesting.
There was a statistic survey out this week
that showed the most popular podcasts,
like the top 10 most popular, not podcasts,
but genres of podcasts.
And nowhere on there was money or investing or finance.
Self-improvement was at the bottom,
true crime and stuff like that was way up the ladder.
But you think about all the podcasts are out there
where you could improve your TED Talks and everything else,
that you could be improving your education,
improving your knowledge, giving yourself up a leg,
kind of a leg up in life.
And we're watching true crime stories
about how to murder our wives.
But we're not even on the genre list in the top 10
as the one thing we depend on for our life, which is money.
So, hey, thanks for watching.
We appreciate it.
And we'll try to make sure you make some money
over the years.
- Well, I'm gonna search for it right now.
Yeah, I know we put all the world's information
for free in everybody's hands.
And what do we do?
We watch cat videos and true crime.
I do want to leave with this great comment
that somebody submitted last weekend,
just to give us a little bit of hope in the story here,
is somebody said these weekly market recap videos
are the new adult version of the Saturday morning cartoons
from where we go.
And I know you and I both got a big laugh out of that.
And we were debating which one of us was Yogi
and which one of us was Booboo.
I'll let the audience decide that.
