I just want to say thanks for the invite to this event tonight. I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
And I also want to thank the panelists because about a little over 15 years ago in the middle of the global financial crisis
when I realized that my superiors on Wall Street didn't know what was happening and didn't know why it was happening
that I would have to figure all this stuff out for myself. And when I first started digging into this
one of the first things I came across was the Mises Institute and the Austrian School of Economics
which explained economics to me in a way that I had never been exposed to before.
And shortly after finding that I found Bob Murphy and I started reading your works and I listened to a number of your presentations
and it really is a fundamental block of my understanding of free market economics.
So thank you for that. Jim, I think I've read all your books, if not all your books, most of your books
and I think you are probably the first person who made me realize that perhaps the most important variable
in all of global markets is the one which is least understood and that's currency.
And so you kind of set me down that road of digging into there. And as far as my compatriot Michael here
I think he has probably over the last couple of years been the most logical and well-spoken person
and I'm obviously biased here but I think in explaining where we're headed and why.
So with that out of the way, I'm a money manager and so for me in my business if you get the timing wrong
you're wrong. Period. Full stop. It's a little bit different than if you are an educator or a philosopher.
And so to me anybody who has even a cursory understanding of financial history knows that fiat currencies die
and global reserve currency holders lose it. So the fact that that always happens, that's not that valuable.
What's really valuable is understanding the dynamics which surround it and the timing.
If you get those two things right then that's valuable. And so my position is pretty simple
and that is de-dollarization cannot happen without extreme economic volatility
and it probably cannot happen without military violence.
And as a result I think this de-dollarization theme while popular is unlikely to happen as quickly and efficiently
and come to an end as soon as most people think.
And the reason is because de-dollarization, while it sounds very simple, it's actually very complex.
De-dollarization in a debt based monetary system is the same thing as de-leveraging.
And when you de-leverage a US dollar denominated system, the US dollar rises.
And when the US dollar rises it causes problems for the whole world.
The Euro dollar market, the whole world chose the dollar as their currency decades ago.
The US didn't force it on them. They chose it.
Now they set the trap of their, they built their own prison essentially.
And the Euro dollar market has become so big and so opaque that it's this Gordian knot that I don't think can be unwound.
I think the only way to get through it is like Alexander did and just blow it up, cut it in half.
And I don't see any foreign leaders out there that are anywhere close to Alexander.
And so I would just say that the Euro dollar market will reinforce the dollar as the global reserve currency if de-dollarization is attempted.
If they somehow, if the people who are de-dollarizing somehow get through that Euro dollar market volatility,
US monetary policy can be used to squash it.
And if by some miracle these world leaders make it through those first two, the US military will be there to back up the dollar.
And I know that last part is not very popular, but it's a fact of life.
And so I think the likelihood of the US dollar losing the global reserve currency in the next six years I think is extremely low.
And Brent, sorry, just for viewers that might not be familiar with the term you use because it's going to come up a lot tonight I think,
can you just briefly just define the Euro dollar market?
Yeah, that's a good point. So the Euro dollar market is really just a dollar that exists outside the United States.
If there's a dollar balance sitting in an account in Turkey, that's a Euro dollar.
If a Japan bank extends US dollar trade finance to a supplier in the Philippines, that's a Euro dollar.
And the Euro dollar market is orders of magnitude larger than the dollar market inside the United States.
So there's incredible demand throughout the whole world for the US dollar.
All right, great. And last but not least, Michael Everyhoo.
Michael, I just want to mention that you are the only one amongst the panelists who lives outside of the US.
So you actually transact, interact and invest in non-US currencies on a daily basis.
Yes, and in US dollars. You want to talk Euro dollar? I'm a Euro dollar sitting here in the room.
I'd like to echo what Brent said in terms of thanking ZeroH for the opportunity to be here.
And I am pretty much an outsider alongside these luminaries in the field, given that I'm a Brit, as you can hear.
I work for a bank based in Singapore, which is a long way from here.
And if you put that together, you might think, what do I have to add? Well, as Adam just said, it's an outsider's view.
I've lived and worked in nine different countries around the world over my life, including in post-communist Russia,
when it was very chaotic, and including in Greater China,
which gives you some insight into what we're talking about when we talk about de-dollarisation.
At the same time, Rabobank are global experts in trade commodity finance,
which is where you will see de-dollarisation happening or not.
You won't see that in the US. You'll see it abroad.
And that combination of factors, I think, makes me relatively well placed, alongside the work I've been doing looking at it anyway.
But what I want to add to everything that Brent just said is this.
If we're making the logical case that we're going to see de-dollarisation, logically, we have to say what's going to replace it.
Because you can't just say it will go away and all the money will go nowhere. It will go into something else.
So what do we think might replace it? Well, will it be another fiat currency?
Well, over the course of the evening, I'm going to answer, no, I don't think there's a single fiat currency that can do that.
Will it be gold? I strongly disavow that notion. I don't think that's realistic.
And again, I hope we can discuss why.
Could it be crypto with Bitcoin going through the roof at the moment?
Again, I don't think so, and I hope we can unpack why later.
Or could it be some BRICS currency based on a basket of commodities, which is an idea being floated out there?
Again, I've done a lot of work looking at this, and I simply don't think that's sustainable.
So logically, whether you like it or not, and I'm not saying I do, if you can't put forward something that's going to replace it, then it's not likely to be replaced.
All right, very well said. So to your points there, Michael, other fiat currencies, potential BRICS competing, new currency, gold and Bitcoin or crypto in general.
We're going to touch on all those four topics in the remaining two plus hours we have left here, folks.
So just letting you know, Michael, I'm glad you brought those up. Yeah, Jim.
I'd like to drop a quick footnote on Brent's comment about the eurodollar being a dollar outside the United States.
When I worked at Citibank, we were one of the leaders in the eurodollar market.
We ran Citibank NASA on the third floor of 399 Park Avenue, and we had a plastic palm tree in the corner just to kind of represent it.
So it's not really about being outside the United States.
It's really about being outside the US regulatory scheme so you can run a bid offer inside what would be the normal commercial bank bid offer if you had to meet all the capital requirements.
It's basically New York and London and Singapore plays a big role as well.
But it's really about getting outside of regulation rather than getting outside the United States.
But there's no question about the importance of it.
All right. Great. Thanks for that clarification, Jim. All right. Well, look, we've got a lot of time, but it's going to go, I think, surprisingly quickly given all the questions that we hope to get through as well as all the expertise that you four gentlemen have.
So I'm going to kick it off here.
I'm going to hold to this list of questions relatively loosely to let the conversation go in whatever directions it wants to go in.
Again, viewers, I encourage you all to have your own conversations in the live chat here. But a reminder that after we get through the main part of the debate here, we will then open up discussion for live Q&A with you, the audience.
So that will be coming up after we get through the officially planned out questions here. All right.
So to kick things off, question number one, will the unprecedented and still rising US debt to GDP ratio erode confidence in the dollar as a reserve currency going forward from here? Bob, why don't we start with you?
Well, sure. And let me take this opportunity to echo the gracious remarks. We want to have a gratitude deficit between the teams here.
I appreciate that. I want to say I don't know if it's in the shot, but they gave us four milkshakes that are on the table here.
So I'm very glad our opponent didn't say the dollar's a turkey because then that just makes it unruly.
So, yeah, joking aside, as I say, the figures, the CBO comes and the CBO, you know, I don't have a problem with it.
They call him nonpowder. They're tasked to say, assume everything goes away, even if everyone knows that the legislation is unrealistic and that, like, you know, when they pass new bills, they put all the painful stuff in the future and then that doesn't actually come to pass.
So the CBO's assumptions are by nature optimistic. They're not building in a bad recession, which I think is in the cards.
And so, again, just to their own 2008 with 39 percent of GDP and then by 2034, 116 percent.
OK. And it's and as opposed to like after World War Two.
Yeah, the US debt was very high and it came down, not because they were running surplus, it's just because the economy was growing faster.
But there was World War Two, like there was a one off event. You understood whether you agree with it or not. OK.
But now this is all built into the cake. This is elderly population. Interest on the debt right now is higher than military spending.
It's 870 billion versus 850. And so, again, these numbers are astronomical stuff that people kind of been warning about for a while.
It's happening right now. So, yes, I don't see any non-painful way to change this trajectory and other things equal.
If you're a foreigner and you keep seeing them piling up the debt, I think you're going to conclude this is unsustainable.
We need to start weaning ourselves off of reliance on this currency. All right, Michael.
I agree with everything that was just said. All I would add is have you seen the fiscal position in every other country in the world?
So, again, that speaks to my point that you can say, I don't want to touch the dollar because of that fiscal mess.
And it is a mess. No question about it. Have you seen the mess in China?
Have you seen the mess in Europe where they can't even print money as easily as they can here because of the structure of the euro?
Or Japan, which has a higher ratio and has managed to keep going for a while.
I can't find a single country, much as I'm looking, genuinely, that actually offers a scalable alternative to the dollar.
So, on that basis, if you've just got a lot of awful choices in front of you, but one of them has got the entrenched network advantage, why would you shift?
Anything else with all the transaction costs of shifting won't be any better.
So, again, I want to see the logical case. And if you can convince me, I'll move my savings tonight.
I would take the same facts, Michael, and argue the opposite. You're right about the other countries being worse.
The United States, our lunch table is Lebanon, Greece, and Italy. So, not to mention Japan.
They're in a completely different world. But none of those are the leading global reserve currency.
And that's the point. When you get to these kind of ratios, who cares about China?
Chinese Yuan is never going to be a global reserve currency.
Can we mark that down?
Please do. Please do. It's in my books. For a lot of reasons, we use a little time.
The number one reason is the rule of law. Who would trust the Chinese at all?
And then apart from the fact that they don't have any significant amount of gold, it's not liquid.
The biggest thing is they don't have a bond market.
We're throwing around the world reserve currencies if People's Bank of China has $100 bills and pallets in their basement,
which they don't. Nobody has the currency. What they have are securities denominated in a currency.
And that's really the key to the U.S. role today, and that'll change.
The key to the U.S. role today is that we have the largest, most liquid government securities market in the world,
the U.S. Treasury securities market, and we can thank Alexander Hamilton for that.
It's been going strong for 230 years, the world's greatest Ponzi, but it works.
But no one else has the bond market. Think about what you need for a bond market.
You have to have issues in all maturities. You need a system of primary dealers.
You need repurchase agreements, hedging things, mechanism, futures, options, settlement, clearance.
You need all that infrastructure that takes decades.
Do you want to come sit here?
That's exactly what I was going to say. There's a space for you here.
No, but that's exactly my point. That's why these other currencies won't be rivals to the dollar.
But we haven't mentioned the ones that will. We'll get to that.
As far as Bob's point, Bob and I are on the same side of the debate.
We agree on the importance of the debt-to-equity ratio, but there's an old saying.
You're entitled to your opinion. You're not entitled to your own facts.
You can tell Bob's a Ph.D. economist because he's relying on the CBO, which produces garbage ad nauseum.
But here are the actual numbers. National debt today is $34.23 trillion.
The GDP today is $27.4 trillion.
A little bit of fifth-grade math, that debt-to-GDP ratio is 125%.
So that's what it is today.
In 1945, at the end of World War II, it was 120%.
So we're right now at an all-time high, higher than it was in World War II.
The thing about World War II is we actually won the war along with our allies.
We were a global hegemon, a global economic power, a global military power.
Today, none of that is true. We have the same debt-to-GDP ratio slightly higher with a military that's lost four wars in a row.
You know, the soldiers are supposed to be our addresses, I guess, when they fly their planes.
No, the recruitment has crashed. Recruitment has crashed.
And by the way, the Russians have a hypersonic missile and we don't.
So I'm not quite so sure about U.S. military superiority.
I spent a lot of time at the Pentagon. We can talk about that as well.
But the key ratio, the key debt-to-GDP ratio is 90%.
That's when the Keynesian multiplier goes from above one to below one.
So when you're below 90%, approximately, you borrow a dollar, you spend a dollar, you get more than a dollar with GDP.
But we're on the same side.
But that's where the United States is.
Everyone else is too. You're dangling something that you think will be different, but you haven't mentioned what you think it will be yet.
Well, I actually have a list of things. We'll get to them. But it won't be the yuan, it won't be the ruble. We can all agree on that.
It won't be the euro. The euro will tag along. But we'll talk about what the actual currency will be.
Fantastic.
We'll get to the big reveal in a bit. Brent, I know you had a point you wanted to chime in with.
I think the point that's really important for people to understand is, and correct me if I'm wrong,
but I believe the argument is being made that because of the fiscal woes of the United States,
the rest of the world is going to demand a higher interest rate in order to buy our bonds if they buy them at all.
And when that higher interest rate rises, it's going to bankrupt the United States.
We're going to have to print dollars ad nauseam, the dollar of the value is going to lose,
and there will be some other new competitor that will step in to fill that role.
And the point I would make is that we're seeing that happen right now.
To your point, reserves have fallen. Interest rates have risen.
The interest expense is now the highest line item in the U.S. budget.
But all that has done is turbocharge the dollar.
The dollar right now is higher than it was post-COVID in May of 2020.
And that is despite helicopter money, despite PPP, despite numerous bailouts,
despite BTFP, despite a guy in the White House who really doesn't know where he's at,
despite a horrible withdrawal from Afghanistan.
You can go on and on about the reasons that the U.S. is in a bad situation,
and as a result, the interest rate is going to rise.
But the interest rates rising makes the dollar more attractive because you get paid more to hold on to it, to your point.
They're not holding currencies, they're holding securities, the rest of the world.
So when they buy a bond, they're getting paid a lot more, and they need the bonds,
they need dollars to pay their own debt that is in U.S. dollars.
The rest of the world owes over $30 trillion, and it's actually closer to $50 trillion.
This is not my numbers, this is the Bank of International Settlements numbers,
that the rest of the world owes in U.S. dollars.
And they don't owe it to the United States, so they can't default on the United States.
They owe it to each other. That's the Eurodollar market.
And so as the U.S. dollar goes higher, it puts the rest of the world in immense pressure.
So think of everything that's happened since March of 2020.
Think of the direction that interest rates have gone.
Think of the expenditures that the U.S. has had to lay out on interest payments.
And yet during that time, the Chinese stock market has melted down.
The Chinese real estate market has melted down.
The Bank of England had to bail out the gilt market.
The Bank of Japan had to bail out both the JGB market and the yen market.
And the ECB, at the same meeting where they finally raised rates for the first time in 10 years,
set up another facility to buy Italian bonds because they were spiking.
So I don't disagree that the United States is in a horrible fiscal situation.
And I think the catalysts that you guys have identified are correct.
I think the conclusions drawn from what those catalysts mean are incorrect.
And that's why I think as the U.S. fiscal situation gets worse, it doesn't make the dollar less valuable.
It makes the dollar more valuable.
And that puts the rest of the world under immense pressure until and when they have an alternative that they can go to.
Bob, I want to give you a chance to respond to that.
Real quick, just for viewers, I want to note one thing. What we're talking about in the major part of this debate
is the dollar's future versus other currencies and its relative value to them.
At some point near the end of the debate, we're going to get into the topic of the dollar's value just versus things,
the dollar's purchasing power, because those are very different things.
The dollar can strengthen versus other fiat currencies but actually weaken in purchasing power versus real products and services.
So I just want to flag that for folks that are wondering if we're going to get to that.
We are going to get to that later in this conversation.
But Bob, to Brent's point there, which is, hey, look, you've done a good job of reciting the litany of ills
that the U.S. economy faces right now in its fiscal situation, but it hasn't mattered.
Dollar is stronger than it's been in years.
Okay, yeah, and one thing just very quickly to respond, the mismatch between the figures that Jim and I were quoting,
he's right, economists have a habit of it's debt held by the public.
So, for example, the Social Security trust fund isn't included in that because it's like, oh, the government owes it to itself.
Now, he's right, it's a slippery game because in other places they don't report that as being a net liability.
They say, oh, no, the trust fund's real, but then they should be including that.
So I agree with him, but that's what the main discrepancy in our percentage is.
And, yeah, to Brent's point, the basic mechanism, just to make sure everyone's getting the point, is that --
and I know he knows this, but just for the viewers -- right, if I'm holding treasuries and they say,
oh, they owe me $1,000 three years from now, but I can see that there's no way they can tax more and borrow more,
and the only thing they can do is print money because they're up against a wall,
then the dollars they're paying me back with are going to be worth less, and so it leads to a vicious cycle.
So, yes, interest rates can start to rise, but then it just all starts unraveling.
So, Ann, I think I'm dovetailing with what Jim's point was.
If it's starting out where the U.S. is in this privileged position where we could basically run deficits
and people would be sending us cars and TVs in exchange for holding more dollars,
when that starts to unravel, it's going to affect us more than other countries that aren't falling off the pedestal.
So even if we're all equally irresponsible, I think Americans will see a bigger shock than other people.
Okay. Michael, why don't you chime in and then we'll move on?
Two very quick responses to that, and maybe we'll unpack them a bit more later.
The first one is I think it's really important to look at how we look at the world.
I have a lot of respect for the Austrian view, but I'm not an Austrian.
I also have a lot of respect for the Marxist view, but I completely disagree with their conclusions.
I think we need to look at things deeply.
Steve King has done some fantastic work actually looking at how you can model a real economy
based on the work of Minsky, who was himself a student of Schumpeter,
and looking at what does and doesn't happen when you run these deficits.
Now, you can logically lock that capital in and it just flows around domestically
and it doesn't create the problem that you're talking about.
I don't think that will happen. I think it will create problems, and I think you are right.
But where I would disagree is that if you're running a large trade deficit and suddenly things start to go wrong,
yes, there is a scenario where you're much poorer, the price of everything spikes,
you can't afford imports, everything collapses.
I've lived in enough emerging markets, I've seen things like that happen with my own eye.
Most Americans can't imagine what it feels like. I've witnessed it and lived it.
What's much more likely to happen in the American case
is you start actually narrowing the trade deficit by making things here again.
Now, that can be an inflationary process, it can be painful, there are winners, there are losers.
But if you're narrowing that current account deficit, that's actually a nice place to be.
It's the people who are running a large trade surplus, like China,
who can no longer sell to you in that environment that face mass unemployment.
So it's not necessarily the downside for America and the upside for everyone else.
It could be, I'm not saying it will be, but it could be the complete inverse.
All right, interesting.
I'll give you a chance to expound more on that later in the conversation, Michael, if you want to.
Hey, one quick question before we get to the next one.
I'm kind of assuming from all of your answers that everybody here
more or less expects the U.S. fiscal situation to continue to worsen from here
when we talk about the worsening U.S. debt to GDP ratio.
Anybody here want to make an argument that it's actually going to get better going forward?
Okay, lots of head shaking. Okay, great.
All right, so there's been a lot of headlines over the past several years about de-dollarization,
that countries are starting to strike all these trade deals that are not in dollars.
And it appears that a catalyst for that was a response to the U.S.
basically weaponizing the U.S. financial system against Russia after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
And actually that's something that in the interview that Putin just gave to Tucker Carlson a week ago,
Putin himself brought up, sort of validated that, yeah, there's a lot of Russia's trading partners
are scrambling to strike deals outside of dollars going forward.
Will that continue, and do you think that will continue to erode confidence in the dollar as a global trade currency?
Since I let the yes team start last time, I think I'm going to let the no team start this time. Brent?
So I think one thing I need to say before I answer the question is that whenever I talk about stuff,
this isn't necessarily what I want to see happen, and it's not necessarily what I think from a moral perspective should happen.
I pretty much deal with what I actually think is going to happen, whether I want it to or not.
And when the U.S. kind of weaponized the dollar versus Russia, the U.S. has many ways that it can weaponize the dollar.
I can't even list them all, but if you want to, we can get into that later.
But when they froze Russia's reserves, I think in the long term, many years from now, as in decades,
that will be seen as a watershed event that probably was a mistake, and I don't think that they should have done it.
But they did it, and they will do it again, because that is their mindset, and while I think that it no doubt
will raise a little red flag for others around the world and make them start questioning how much they can trust the United States,
I think largely countries already knew this. This is not the first time the United States has done something like this.
They've put sanctions on Russia before. They've put sanctions on Venezuela. They've invaded countries.
They've been basically at war since World War II. I mean, the U.S. has been practicing for World War III since the end of World War II.
So the fact that if these leaders around the world just today wake up and realize that the U.S. is capable of some inaltruistic methods,
then they are pretty naive. I mean, it's nice to think that the world is a nice, friendly place, and in a perfect world, that would be great.
That's just not reality, and again, as a money manager, I deal with reality, what's actually going on in the world,
not philosophy, not theory, like what's actually happening, and while there's no doubt some countries that have kind of been put on alert
when they're probably looking for ways to de-dollarize, there's no question they're looking for ways to de-dollarize,
there's also the case where some people, some places, are getting closer to the United States.
When the bully goes onto the playground and beats somebody up, you have two alternatives.
You can run, run far away, or you can run right next to the bully and be his friend and he'll protect you, and that is happening as well.
So, I don't think you necessarily can say that just because the United States confiscated Russia's reserves,
that now the rest of the world is automatically going to gang up and go against the United States.
Is it possible? Sure, it's possible. I think it's a very low likelihood.
Okay. Michael, you want to add to that?
Yeah, absolutely. Well, speaking from what we're seeing on the ground, we are seeing marginal moves towards doing that from some parts of the global economy,
but it's important to understand how they're doing it. Again, there's no substitute to the dollar being put forward per se.
What you are seeing are two different economies agreeing to effectively do barter for goods between each other, which is priced in US dollars.
They're still thinking in dollars, it's the ghost of Banquo at the feast that you can't get rid of,
but then they actually transact and clear in local currency with each other, so it stays away from the US dollar system completely.
Now, can that work? Yes and no. There's less demand for dollars internationally if you're doing that at the margin.
Absolutely, that's the case. There's less flow of dollars there, but they're still thinking in dollars.
No one's thinking of pricing in anything else or accounting in anything else, and it's a desperately inefficient way to do things.
If barter was actually a good way to run the global economy, things would look very different and we'd all be a lot poorer than we are now.
So that's a purely defensive mechanism which some countries at the margin are trying,
and I think they'll find out fairly soon it's a pretty expensive, unpleasant way to live.
So I don't deny that is happening, but to think that that is a genuine, logical, system-wide alternative that can emerge,
that can actually start pushing the dollar off the throne, I think is very unrealistic if we expect to maintain the kind of living standards that we have now.
What you're describing, this is why money was invented in the first place, to take place of barter,
so you didn't have to walk around with a cow and find somebody who wanted a cow and give you a pair of shoes.
I mean, money survives or solves that double coincidence at once, and of course black markets exist, of course barter can happen.
It's not efficient. If it was efficient, dollars never would have been invented in the first place.
Exactly.
All right, Jim, I know you've got some thoughts.
Yeah, Brent said a lot of bad things happening, but don't worry about it,
and Michael gave us the Bronze Age version of bricks, so why don't we get a little more up to date.
First of all, it's important to bear in mind the distinction between a reserve currency and a trading or payment currency.
The reserve currency is the numeraire of the securities you hold in reserves, but you can have a payment currency.
You can make almost anything. In case we traded baseball cards and bottle caps, you could do that, and maybe it's quasi-barter,
but that's an important distinction because the rise of a trading currency or payment currency can lead to reserve currency status.
In fact, it can happen very quickly once you create a securities market, which is what Woodrow Wilson did in World War I with the Liberty Bonds.
So just kind of keep that in mind. Now, the bricks are now the BRICS 10. They're not a new invention.
They had a big summit in August 2023 in South Africa, but they were actually formed on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting in 2006.
They had their first formal summit in Ekaterinburg, Russia in 2009.
In 2010, they admitted to South Africa, so the S went from a small S to a capital S because now South Africa was involved.
In 2014, they created the New Development Bank. The New Development Bank was funded with over $100 billion of actual capital or commitments.
But what it does, it basically is a development bank. It can lend to members, but there are countries who are not BRICS who are members of the New Development Bank,
so it can give them infrastructure loans. What does that sound like? It's the World Bank. They basically created their own version of the World Bank.
In 2015, they created the Contingent Reserve Arrangement, the CRA. What does that do?
It's a swing lender for members who are in temporary distress. You're running. There's some capital outflow from your country.
You need a loan, make some policy changes, fix it up, maybe put on capital controls. This CRA facility exists to do that.
What does that sound like? That's the IMF. In other words, the BRICS spent the last 15 years recreating the Bretton Woods institutions on their own terms.
They have their own World Bank. They have their own IMF. It's not just the Leaders' Summit. Of course, we all pay a lot of attention to that.
They have over 100 meetings per year. They have a sports committee, a women's rights committee, et cetera.
A women's rights committee? The BRICS nations. Interesting.
As far as women's rights are concerned, America is the one putting men in women's swim meets, so I'm not sure whether those are women's rights.
Let's look in the mirror. We have new members, which are the UAE, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia.
There are 17 countries on the waiting list. 40% of the BRICS have 40% of the world's population.
54% of global GDP using purchasing power parity, which is a different method, but it is well regarded.
30% of the land surface of the world. 50% of wheat and rice production.
15% of the world's gold reserves. Two of the three largest oil producers, Saudi Arabia and Russia.
Two of the three largest nuclear arsenals, Russia and China. Russia, of course, number one.
Four of the seven largest land mass countries. Michael's given us the third world version.
I've been to all these countries. It was Zaire in the day, but Congo, the heart of darkness.
I've been all over the third world. This is not what we're talking about.
We're talking about, as I say, more than half of global GDP and well over half of the global population.
Now, the way Michael described it, this is factually correct, but not where it's going and not where it's going to end up.
Yeah, the UAE is working on a deal with China where the UAE will pump oil and accept yuan for the oil.
India, Russia have a bilateral trade relationship thanks to Europe being foolish enough to cut off cheap Russian energy,
but Russia sells oil to India. India pays them in rupees.
The problem with that, and again, Michael pointed to this, is it's bilateral. What are you going to do with the rupees?
You can get rupees deposited in a bank account in Mumbai for your account, but how much curry do you actually need if you're Russian?
So there are limitations on that. That goes without saying.
So the key to getting a new world currency is basically to expand the membership, and exhibit A, of course, is the euro.
Now, I had one very well-regarded commentator who said, well, you know, they can't really do that because they don't have a common fiscal policy.
I said, are you kidding? You think Greece and Germany have a common fiscal policy, or the Netherlands and Italy? Of course they don't.
But they have a common monetary policy through an entity, so what you need is a new currency.
It won't be the yuan, it won't be the rupee, it won't be the Indian rupee, it won't be any of those currencies,
because they all have a problem, which is in bilateral trade, when you get the other guy's currency, how much do you really need?
The answer is probably not very much. What are you going to do with it? You really don't know.
All you can do is dump it and get back to dollars. So you're in that closed circuit, kind of the euro/dollar world that Brent was talking about.
But if you launch a new currency with an expanded membership, now all of a sudden you're Russia, you sell oil to India,
you get paid in the new BRICS currency, you can go shopping in China, you can buy manufactured goods, you can go to Turkey,
they're on the waiting list for membership, etc. You can go to Brazil and buy aircraft, etc.
So if you have 20 or 30 countries where you can go shopping with the currency, all of a sudden it's a very liquid payment currency,
and then that's the genesis of a bond market. The bond market takes more time.
Can I jump in there?
Yeah, real quick. As you do, the conversation has trundled into the next question I was going to ask anyways,
is there a potential for a BRICS trade currency to basically really credibly challenge the dollar?
I think Jim has just made his case that he thinks it's possible. He even says it's coming. So Michael.
I've spent a lot of time looking at this and in detail, because it's very easy to listen to the political pronouncements
and read off data points that don't really bear any relationship to actual reality now or in the near future,
particularly by 2030, if we remember the terms of the debate.
If we just shaded in colors on a country map of the world, absolutely BRICS wins hand down, but we're not playing BRICS.
It's not a board game like that. It's much more complicated.
If we just run through all the countries in BRICS, and I'm not going to go through all of them,
because that would take up the whole time. We know for a fact there's enormous tension between India and China,
which kind of matters when you're looking at the two largest economies which are close to war on their border
and presuming that those two have some kind of synergy politically or economically.
That's a red herring. This is not a political alliance. It's an economic alliance. It is not.
Try telling that to Europe. If you're talking about creating a BRICSO, like a euro,
where we still have tension in Europe today, even after the euro has been there with lots of countries
that have been at peace together since World War II, and we're saying we're going to take all these disparate countries,
which are physically almost at daggers drawn in some cases, and say don't worry,
there's going to be one overarching currency between all of you. It's politically very unrealistic.
We've also had, for example, Saudi Arabia just very recently say we didn't join BRICS.
They actually said we did, and then they came out a few weeks later and said we didn't, we're still thinking about it.
So the whole thing is a series of headlines rather than actual ground-up real reality.
They may have a women's committee, but I don't see a lot of progress for women in the BRICS in general,
and I think the same is true for the overall infrastructure.
Even if they did set it up, which I think politically is an absolute leap into the dark if we're talking about 2030,
what interest rate is it going to have for that enormous geographic sphere?
It doesn't work in Europe very well. Who's going to set that interest rate?
Who's going to set monetary policy? Who's going to set tariff policy?
I mean Europe is still struggling with all of these things enormously with very, very congruent cultures at peace with each other.
I cannot conceive realistically how this can be done, and some of the countries, just to finish,
some of the countries are pegged to the dollar. Like the UAE uses the dollar by another form.
Saudi Arabia uses the dollar by another form. How is this going to work?
It's unfortunate you can't conceive of it because it's happening. Let me just expand a little bit.
So Sergey Lavrov, who's the foreign minister of Russia, of course, the Russian prime minister, best foreign minister in the world,
he sort of gave away the game a little bit. He said, because you see, you have a BRICS currency.
So I'll call it a BRIC. I don't know what they call it.
Call it the BRICO.
Well, maybe the Bancor, actually.
How did that work out, by the way?
Well, it didn't get off the ground because the U.S. squashed it, and it wasn't a question of Bretton Woods being, you know,
his consensual treaty. It was the United States dictating terms by the Treasury representative with the Stalinist agent,
which was revealed in the 1990s. So it was designed to destroy the British Empire and did a pretty good job of it.
So that was Bretton Woods. But now getting back to the BRICS, they're going to take the –
and by the way, Keynes at Bretton Woods proposed the Bancor was going to be linked to gold.
Now, he had looked at a basket of currencies. I read all those papers on this.
He said, yeah, we'll have so many barrels of oil and so many bushels of wheat, et cetera.
And then he said that the more he researched, he said, the practicalities of that are daunting.
You know, oil, there's 73 kinds of grades of oil based on sulfur content, transportation, wheat rots in the bins, et cetera.
So go to gold, not because it's shiny and it's pretty, but because it actually is atomic number 79.
It actually is an element. There's one grade, it's either gold or it isn't gold. You don't really have to debate that.
The BRICS have gone through a similar process. They looked at a basket of commodities and later said,
we pretty quickly got to the conclusion that it has to be linked to gold. Now, this is not a classical gold standard.
You're not going to be able to walk, take your bushel of BRICS and go to the People's Bank of China and say, give me gold.
That is a gold standard. You should be able to present your currency and get paid in gold.
They're not going to have that, but they're going to link the value of the BRIC, the single BRIC, to a weight of gold.
And that's critical. You actually don't need gold to have that gold standard.
They do have a fair amount of gold, but you don't need to do that. All you have to do is say that's how much it's worth.
Now, through a transit of law, of course, the dollar is worth, the gold is worth a certain number of dollars.
But the dollar has to do all the dirty work. This is why I say it's not the, the BRICS will surpass the dollar.
But the dollar's not going to wait. Can I just jump in there, Jim, to make two very quick points?
Because I do understand what you're saying. Effectively, the BRICS currency is going to be pegged to gold one way or another.
By weight. By weight, OK. There are two problems with it. And I won't monopolize any further. I promise I'll back off.
The first one is, effectively, if you move to a gold standard, and we know this. It's not a gold standard.
Well, OK, it's linked to gold. Linked is the right word.
One of the reasons why people would want to do that, and I respect the argument, even if I disagree with it,
the outcome, is it's deeply deflationary. It's a straitjacket that you effectively put on fiscal policy.
Good luck doing that in countries like China with a 16% fiscal deficit when you account for local government.
And that's during a normal period of growth, like on a recession. Not debt to GDP, fiscal deficit, 16%.
Gold is not deflationary. That's one of the greatest, I'd like to bend Bernanke about this.
It's completely deflationary. It's completely deflationary.
But I disagree and Bernanke doesn't agree. Just look at the history of the Great Depression.
So why do Austrians want it, then? Because it's inflationary?
Austrians have a contribution, but they're kind of on a narrow gauge.
Well, let's part that for a second.
I'm not an Austrian.
Your turn.
Let's ask the Austrian in the room.
That's the greatest myth I've debated.
Rovini, Bernanke, all of them. I'm happy to take it up.
Let's part that one for a second and we'll come back to it with an Austrian.
But the second point is this. Even if the bricks all come together,
and I've done the dirty, boring work of actually looking at the really detailed trade flows between all of them
by value-added, right the way out from commodities to the highest value-added product.
It's really boring work. It's not particularly mathematically complicated.
It just involves downloading lots and lots of tedious spreadsheets and putting them together manually
because you can't get that data anywhere else.
And if you look at the trade map of all these bricks countries, no matter how large you draw that map out,
it does not work as a block in terms of the internal supply and demand.
Is Kazakhstan going to sell gas to Turkmenistan and to Russia?
And what's Russia going to sell to Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan?
Gas. Everyone sells commodities to each other because there's very little final consumer production
or demand in any of them until you get to China, which produces absolutely everything.
And Brazil.
Well, they don't produce that much.
And Turkey.
Well, and where do Turkey and China, and Turkey's not even a member yet, where do they sell...
You're on a list.
I said it will take a few years.
Let me just mention my point.
Where do they sell their products to?
Turkey, massive trade surplus with the European Union who will never join this system.
China, massive trade surplus with the US who will never join this system.
So even if they do manage to create it internally, they will have a huge surplus of products
which they're trying to sell to a block, which will be America and the others, who will say,
"Not on your life. Go away."
So it doesn't fly.
And I've done the maths on it. It does not fly.
I don't know how to break it to you, Michael, but some of them have joined the National Development Bank.
I can't drum as well as you do, but they are signing up.
The Europeans are basically bastards of the United States, but they'll do what's in their best interest.
And as the dollar declines, they'll find the brick is a very attractive current.
It's not ready yet.
As I said, it's going to be a few years.
You have to expand the membership.
You have to do the gold link.
You have to determine that.
The dollar's got to fight the valuation in the market because gold is a dollar-based market.
Hey, Jim, just as time cop, I'll give you a minute left to finish the thought.
Well, that was pretty much it.
This is going to take time.
They have to expand the membership.
And you have a very closed system, Michael.
They're not limited to trading with each other.
Other countries will take the brick once it reaches a critical mass,
and that's a matter of getting more countries in the system.
I mean, people in the United States take euros for shipments to Europe.
They can convert them to dollars very easily.
You don't have to be in the euro to accept euro as payment.
You don't have to be in the bricks to accept a brick currency as payment.
Okay.
Brent, I'm going to come to you in a sec, but Bob has been waiting.
And also we had some assumptions made from the Austrian side.
You're the Austrian in the room, so let's hear from you.
Okay, sure.
So, yeah, on that narrow point, and just for some --
and it's awkward here because I know most people in this conversation know these things,
but we're giving some facts to the viewers, perhaps.
So from 2000 to 2022, and this is just using the official data that's reported to the World Gold Council,
that China and Russia -- China quadrupled its gold holdings, measured in physical terms, not market value,
and Russia was like five times.
Okay, so why are they doing that?
Presumably they're doing -- they're trying to wean themselves to have shock absorbers.
They're trying to reduce their vulnerability to a U.S. economic boycott.
That seems to be obvious.
And so, yes, I guess maybe we're debating over terminology, but, yeah, if your currency is linked to gold,
then it holds its purchasing power over time relative to purely fiat one.
That's the argument.
And sorry, to Michael's point, though, that it sort of puts a straight jacket on you.
Do you agree with his point there or see it?
That's the function of the classical gold standard, yes.
But the data does not support that conclusion.
You go back to the early 1930s, at the time, because you're not limited to the physical amount of gold,
you can have credit during the heyday of the gold standard for Britain.
They had about 20% gold reserves in the United States, and the first half of the 20th century was about 40%.
Then we lowered it to 25%.
Then we got rid of it in the Vietnam War.
Then we know what happened in 1971.
But you go back to the early 1930s, the myth is that gold constrained the increase in the money supply,
and that contributed to the Great Depression is not true.
And Bernanke made his reputation as a scholar of monetary policy in the Great Depression.
You make my point for me, it's an Anki reputation.
Well, let me finish.
I'll show you why you're absolutely wrong about the deflationary aspect of gold.
Because during the Great Depression, the law allowed the money supply, base money,
to be two and a half times the amount of gold at the market, $20.67 an ounce.
It never went over 100%.
The Federal Reserve could have more than doubled the money supply and still stayed within the gold standard at the time.
So gold was not a constraint on money creation.
The problem was nobody wanted to lend and nobody wanted to spend.
It was psychological.
The banks weren't lending, and people didn't want to borrow.
I disagree completely.
I talked to Bernanke about this.
But why are we holding up Bernanke as any standard of anything?
Because he has facts. He actually did the research and he has facts.
Bernanke also argued quite concretely it doesn't matter how high private debt levels ever get.
Well, you can change it.
Michael, you're free to change the topic, but just go back to the facts.
The depths of the Great Depression, money supply never exceeded 100% of gold.
It had been two and a half times higher, and it wasn't.
You can say that's a failure of the Fed, but it was not a constraint of gold.
That's just a fact.
I'm not going to argue that point because I don't have that historical point for the Americans.
All I would tell you, and this is really getting a bit obtuse here,
but in the British example, we went off gold in 1931 and the economy immediately reflated.
We had a terrible 1920 sticking to the gold standard.
As soon as we went off it, one labor MP said, "I didn't know we were allowed to do that."
And as soon as they did, the economy reflated.
Of course, war rearmament helped as well.
So it was inflationary as soon as we went off a bit, which is what they wanted at the time.
But that's a separate argument.
Barry Eichengreen is the greatest scholar of that.
He showed that when Britain went off gold, their economy expanded.
When the U.S. went off gold, 1933, '34 was a great year for the U.S. stock market
when we devalued against gold.
The same thing happened later in France.
By the way, Eichengreen did a fabulous job on the research.
He did already.
Really hard work.
But what all that misses is that all you were doing was shifting the burden.
One country got a boost, but someone else suffered.
When the U.K. got better, France got a lot worse.
So the fact that you went off gold and devalued the currency did not help the world.
It helped you.
I didn't say it did.
Maybe if it's American first or British first or whatever.
But the world is like that.
Well, it's a negative-sum game, and you can play it as long as you want.
But if you want global growth and if you want a system that actually works for everyone,
then the point is gold is not a constraint because you can have credit on top of it.
I'm going to jump in here just because we actually have questions about the potential
to return to a gold standard coming up in a bit.
I've got two questions I want to get to in a second.
Brett, if you can be quick, we'll go to you.
I just want to make a quick point, and I'll try to make it quick, based on some of the
things that have been said about the whole de-dollarization process.
And the reason I love this topic is it's the same reason I love science fiction.
It's creative.
It's interesting.
It's out of the box.
And in 20 or 30 years, some of it will be true.
But again, we get back to this timing by 2030.
You know, if this was really going to happen, you're going to need actual business people
to be involved.
And we've seen Modi on stage.
We've seen Da Silva on stage.
We've seen Lavrov on stage.
You know, when Roman Abramovich buys a vacation house, he buys it in St. Bart's.
He doesn't buy it in the Crimea.
When Paulo Lemon, who's the biggest business guy in Brazil, you don't see him on stage
with Da Silva talking about this new currency.
When have you ever seen Lakshmi Mittal with Modi on stage hailing this new BRICS union?
Again, it's fine for politicians and monetary authorities to get on stage and say we want
to do this.
It's a great selling point.
It makes them seem like very involved and capable.
But it strikes me that people in the United States will look at our political leaders
and monetary authorities and immediately think they're idiots.
But then they'll see these monetary authorities and political leaders from other parts of
the world and think they're geniuses.
They can just because they snap their fingers, it's all going to happen.
And again, this is all theoretical at some point down in the future.
And my point is, in the meantime, if they even try it, the euro dollar market will punish
them so quickly and so severely that they will back off.
And I haven't heard anybody put forward a thesis of how they can get to this new currency
without the dollar punishing them in the short term.
I'll answer that question.
They're building their own banks, their own communication channels.
It's capitalized in US dollars.
Hold on.
That bank that you spoke about, the $100 million?
$100 million.
In dollars.
Yeah.
Their CFO says our accounting department is factored in dollars.
And the loans they make are in dollars.
I didn't say the US wasn't the leading reserve currency today.
Of course it is.
We're talking about five, seven years.
But five to seven years is like that in global markets.
It's been going on since 2008.
And they haven't made any progress.
They've made enormous progress.
Okay.
So Jim, to your point there, their banks will be dollar dependent.
What progress have they made?
What progress have they made?
What progress has been made since they started in 2008?
You'll be the last to know.
I mean, I explained.
The new development bank, the contingency reserve arrangement, expanding the membership,
putting the architecture together, building their own payments channels.
I mean, literally communications channels, laying fiber optic cables
so they don't have to go through any of the existing communication system.
It's one step at a time.
They're building it from the ground up.
Well, I wrote an article with a slightly sarcastic take on this.
Very sarcastic.
Eastern powers in gold member playing on Austrian powers, for those who remember it.
But we don't have any real sign.
I mean, you've got those headlines, yeah.
But where is the real actuality where serious business people are starting to plan?
Serious business people are not involved in it.
If you can find me a serious business person...
These are sovereign currencies.
Business people don't create currencies.
They use them when they're there.
And when this is ready, they'll use them just like anything else
because it's in their interest to make money.
So who's going to make the manufacturer in Kazakhstan sell to a producer in Brazil?
No one will make anyone do anything.
They'll find it in their own best interest partly because of what's going on with the U.S. dollar.
Let me turn to that for a second because you've sort of sucked off these sanctions
as if they're nothing.
Now, you're right that the U.S. has done this all the time.
This is how we got Bayer Aspen in World War I.
We just took it from the Germans.
But what's going on now is a different order of magnitude.
And I've done war games in the Pentagon.
I was in one where we were in a skiff and there were about 10 of us sitting around the table.
And there was a guy sitting to my left, David Dollar, who's a senior U.S. government official,
responsible for the role of the U.S. dollar in Asia, an interesting last name.
And I'm kind of saying things similar to what I'm saying right now,
warning about the use of sanctions.
They work in limited circumstances.
They don't work in other circumstances.
I'll explain the difference.
But they do work to some extent.
Obama used it pretty effectively to get Iran to the table for the JCPOA, the Joint Plan of Action.
So David, I think, got a little fed up with me, and he slammed both hands on the table.
Palm down. Boom.
He said, "The dollar has been the leading reserve currency.
It's the leading reserve currency today, and it will always be the leading reserve currency."
And I said, "David, I feel like I'm sitting in Whitehall in 1913 listening to John Bull explain the role of Sterling."
And that was literally when the situation turned and it was all downhill from there.
So as I said, it doesn't happen overnight.
But what I was warning the Pentagon about was that the overuse of sanctions,
now they've gone not only too far but to the point of destroying the dollar.
And this is why it will accelerate.
This is a nonlinear process.
It's not like, "Oh, gee, it's been 10 years already. It'll be 10 more or 20 more."
Bob made this point earlier.
This will accelerate from here.
And the key thing is the freezing of the Russian reserves.
Approximately $300 billion in U.S. Treasury securities.
Fortunately, it's mostly in European banks, so you've got to get the Europeans to go along with this.
It's only about, I think, less than $30 billion in U.S. banks.
But here's the point.
We freeze stuff all the time.
We freeze the Iranians.
We freeze North Korea.
But there's a difference between freezing and seizing.
Seizing is when you actually convert the property to your own use.
And the Biden administration has proposed seizing these assets because they can't get the $60 billion through the Congress
because the people are beginning to see that, "Why would you support the neo-Nazis and the oligarchs in Ukraine?"
There are elections in Russia next month.
There are elections in the U.S. later this year.
There are no elections in Ukraine.
The idea that we're fighting for democracy is nonsense.
They're arresting political opponents and trying to do that in this country, as a matter of fact.
But they've already canceled their elections.
The main driver there are the banderistas, the neo-Nazis, and that's who the U.S. is supporting.
But be that as it may, when you get to these sanctions, so now they can't get the $60 billion through the Congress.
Well, that's easy.
We've got $300 billion in Russian assets.
We're not just going to freeze them.
You see how they're freezing?
You can't get your interest.
You can't trade them.
We're agreeing with you on that.
We're agreeing with you.
There's no disagreement from outside.
Okay, but it's happening.
This is my point.
The dollar is going to be around, not forever, but for the foreseeable future.
And I'm trying to explain why we're doing things.
We, the United States, are doing things right now that are going to destroy the dollar.
Because once you seize these assets, and they want to do it on February 22nd, which is the second anniversary of the war,
and then the craziest idea was have Ukraine issue a bond issue, collateralized by the Russian assets,
of course the Ukrainians will default because they don't have any money.
And then the $300 billion could go to pay off the bondholders.
But it's all outright theft.
I said default.
I don't care what you call it.
You can't default on $300 billion worth of the treasury and not impact the dollar.
So you agree that this will need to apply to the dollar.
I didn't say the end.
I said it's just the erosion of its status.
I think you're misunderstanding the point I'm trying to make.
So I totally agree with you, and I think I stated at the beginning that I think in hindsight that will be-
You said many years from now we'll look back.
We're going to look back a month from now and say it was a mistake.
You said many years.
It's going to be about a month.
Okay.
So if that's the case, in a month from now we look back and say it's a mistake.
I would assume that that means that U.S. interest rates are going to rise in the dollars
because people are going to be scared to buy treasuries.
Is that fair?
No.
I mean, you have to see in the short run the interest rates are going to collapse
because we're heading into a severe recession.
There's a global dollar shortage.
When people see Chinese treasury securities holdings decline,
"Oh, the Chinese are getting out of the dollar."
No, they're not.
There's a dollar shortage.
They're selling the treasuries.
Again, totally agree.
They don't have enough dollars.
They've got to bail out of their own banks.
Totally agree.
Totally agree.
But if you're Saudi Arabia or you're India or you're Turkey or you're Brazil or you're any other country
and you say, "Oh, the U.S. just defaulted in effect on $300 billion of treasury securities
because they took them back," the day will come maybe sooner than later when they don't like
something I'm going to do, so I'm going to get out of treasuries when I can.
Now, it doesn't happen overnight, but the point is-
It happens in a month apparently, though.
There'll be a radical mistake by the United States in a month that will significantly erode confidence
and accelerate the process.
How does the rest of the world that owes $30 trillion, $50 trillion,
depending on how you calculate on balance sheet or off balance sheet numbers,
how do they lose $50 trillion in assets and not suffer?
I never said they lose $50 trillion.
I'm saying they will because they owe $50 trillion to each other.
That's the Eurodollar debt.
They owe it to each other. They don't owe it to the United States.
So if that loses value, they're losing value in their assets.
How does that not punish them?
Punish whom?
The holders of those bonds or those loans.
It punishes the whole world. That's the second great depression.
In that scenario, which direction does the dollar go versus other currencies?
At that point, you are talking about something closer to a dollar collapse.
Before it collapses, which way does it go?
Right now, the dollar's getting stronger.
Which way will it go if those loans collapse and they default on them?
It goes higher, Jim.
The dollar goes higher.
In a dollar squeeze, in a credit contraction, the dollar goes higher.
Well, you're not distinguishing between nominal and real terms.
The dollar could be higher in real terms.
Versus other currencies, which way does it go?
Versus other currencies, which way does it go?
Well, they're all in the same boat.
There's no world where the dollar is crashing and everyone says, "Get me some euros."
They're all going to crash together.
Which way does the dollar go versus the euro and the yen and the yuan in the scenario?
Well, why don't you ask the real question, which way does the dollar go relative to gold?
We'll get to that.
No, I'll get to it right now.
This is the world of $5,000 gold.
In other words, it's impossible for every currency to devalue against every other currency at the same time.
Which is exactly why the dollar will rise.
Which is exactly why the dollar will rise.
That's a mathematical impossibility, except against gold.
You're missing the point.
No, Jim, you're not missing the point.
I think the dollar and gold rise.
Yeah, the euro could be $0.90 and the dollar index could be $115.
That could happen.
It happened in 1984.
But this is the world of $5,000 gold.
I agree.
Can I ask you guys a question, too?
Well, is that a stronger dollar?
Please say it.
You've got to take your measure, sir.
No, no, Jim.
Are you using a woo-woo or a yardstick?
If you're measuring against currency, the dollar is stronger.
But if you're measuring against gold, the dollar is weaker.
Jim, we're going to come to gold in a bit.
I'll let you chime in.
So it seems like a lot of what you guys are saying is, yeah, we agree all these things equal.
We agree on looks.
A lot.
We all agree on looks.
So like Jim is saying, if I were a Chinese firm, I wouldn't want a whole bunch of trade
because I would think if we start playing funny with Taiwan, the US government might
say, hey, we could save ourselves a trillion dollars by just declaring so other things
equal.
If you're a multinational firm, wouldn't you want to reduce your whole-- again, it's not
that, oh, zero in treasuries and everything else in euros tomorrow.
That's not worse.
But if they just reduce their holdings, they're-- you're right.
You say China and India are not the best of friends.
OK, so you don't go all in on one thing.
But that's, I think, part of our point is the dollar is the strongest right now.
So if everyone's more just diversifying because the world's going to be chaotic, that means
the dollar loses its relative position.
Can I jump in for a second, Nick?
I think I know where we're thinking the same thing.
If we're in a world right now where nominally it's the one world economy, nominally it still
is, even though you can see this fragmentation is very rapidly occurring and mistakes being
made by both sides, by the way, China and Russia certainly aren't innocent of that.
But the US, too, are accelerating that breakup.
The dollar already has this leading role within this one world system.
If you do see it return to a violent zero sum, which I expect, mercantilist, unpleasant
world, which gold will definitely accelerate, were we to go that route.
Because historically, gold is zero sum.
And everyone has to be all against all.
As I was saying, that's what I expected.
If we do go there, who's the biggest, meanest dog in the pack?
Russia.
No, the US, by far.
Yeah, it's Russia.
Is the ruble going to rise versus the dollar?
Are you sure?
Is the ruble going to rise versus the dollar next year?
Let's-- again, I like to stick to facts.
Here are the percent-- here's the gold to GDP ratio.
Well, I'm sorry.
But gold to GDP ratio doesn't--
You can't just say I'm going to stick to facts.
If gold is money-- and by the way--
No, no, no.
We're not saying that we go from there to gold being money.
We're saying--
You can't talk about the strength of the dollar and ignore gold.
It's the biggest player in the room.
The currency versus currency is a joke.
It's currencies versus gold.
Currency versus currency.
We're talking about muscle versus muscle.
Who's the strongest current country in the world?
Currency versus currency.
Russia's the strongest country in the world.
Country.
I'm going to intervene.
I'm not using gold.
Just overall, Russia is the world.
OK.
Strongest country by what metric?
The totality of resources, human capital,
physical capital, technology, military power, geography,
the way the rivers run, agricultural production,
even gold and resources in the ground that haven't been tapped yet.
You're trying to say Russia with its declining population.
That's not what I said.
I was talking about gold.
No, but I'm not having that conversation.
OK, fine.
I can see why.
So all against all, if it's all against all in all measures
rather than just I've got more gold than you,
which is what we will move into if the global system breaks down.
It's not more gold.
It's the gold to GDP ratio.
We were talking earlier about debt to GDP is an important way.
Bob brought it up.
I completely agree.
That's where the United States crossed the threshold into the doom loop in 2008.
But GDP is your economy.
Do you agree with that?
It's a rough measure of an economy.
GDP is a rough measure of an economy.
In China's case, it can be widely distorted.
Pierpont Morgan is one of the most misquoted individuals of all time.
He's always quoted as saying gold is money.
It's not what he said.
He never said that.
He said money is gold and nothing else.
That's a completely different statement.
I think we're having two separate points here, though.
No, I'm there.
So let's just say gold is money because it's a form of money and compare it to GDP.
How much money do you have?
Do you think that's irrelevant?
Yeah.
Okay.
That's how much real money you have relative to your economy.
Let me make my point.
No, I'll finish mine.
Russia is 8.3% gold to GDP.
My dad's bigger than your dad.
Sorry?
My dad's bigger than your dad.
But that's seriously the point I'm making.
We don't need to bring our fathers into this.
Seriously.
No, seriously.
My father passed away in 2002.
He was given two presidential unit citations by President Roosevelt.
He's not in this conversation.
I assume he's rooting for you.
It's a joke, but the point I'm making is...
It's not a good one.
You are making a very good point and a clear point about gold to GDP ratios.
What I'm trying to say, but you keep talking over me when you're saying it, is...
You didn't let me finish.
But the point that I'm trying to make logically supersedures, which is this.
If we get to a really violent all-against-all world where we've got warfare going on,
which we have in two locations and maybe more,
where the whole global system starts to fragment,
where there is no one who's top dog within a clearly agreed one-world peaceful system
and everyone is using sharp elbows to get what they want,
which we're starting to see happen now already...
Yes, I have to tackle that.
Oh, you've got slightly more gold than me, therefore you win.
No, it will be a full spectrum national power contest to see who can achieve what.
And you won't just say, "Well, your metric is slightly higher than mine, so you win."
And the US and that spectrum still trumps Russia or others.
And the dollar will still be what you would run into.
Well, you know what I said an hour ago, which is that is one of the ways the UK won World War I,
is because they did have the gold and they did have the credit that goes with it.
You don't need gold for currency, ounce for dollar, ounce for...
Are they going to throw gold at each other?
Don't be silly, Michael. Let's talk seriously about money and GDP.
I am. I am being deadly serious.
Okay, well then here are the numbers. Russia gold to GDP 8.3%.
Jim, sorry, I'm going to interrupt because we're going to get to gold specifically
that I think this is a great intern there.
And I do have to give a quick sponsor message in just a moment.
Before I do, Brent, I think you had like five truncated attempts to get somewhere.
Anybody out there that is watching and thinks that fiat versus fiat doesn't matter,
I urge you, I beg you, I plead with you to get that notion out of your mind.
Every time, I can show you a chart going back to 1970.
Any time there has been either a global economic slowdown or crisis of some kind,
it has coincided with the dollar rising versus other fiat.
Now whether the dollar rising causes the crisis or whether the dollar rises in response to the crisis,
I'm not smart enough to figure that out.
All I know is that the correlation is not high, it's 100%.
And every time in the last 20 years that we've got into a crisis
and we've got into a situation where the dollar rose quickly versus other fiat
and asset prices fell, gold got liquidated initially as well.
Now, I'm a big believer in gold and I think everybody should own gold
and I think it should be the cornerstone of everybody's portfolio
because when that liquidation event ends, gold rises quicker and faster than anything else.
It can't be inflated away and it can't be deflated to zero.
But the dollar rising versus other fiat is the most important ratio in global finance.
And if you don't believe that, I urge you to do the work to figure out why it is.
All right, thanks.
And we're going to get to gold.
We're going to get there via a question about the petrodollar beforehand just to give you guys a quick heads up.
Just a reminder for the panelists that the proposal that was sort of the crux of this debate
is the US dollar will cease to be the leading world reserve currency by the year 2030, yes or no?
That is actually a fiat versus fiat question.
And again, we're going to dive into how some sort of hardbacking like a gold could break that mold.
But I want to make sure that when we get to the end of this discussion
that we have summary remarks around that initial fiat versus fiat commentary.
All right, very quickly, folks, two things.

I just want to show some of their products here just so you see what we're talking about.
The folks at Intera were kind enough to send this to my family the week before I came out here for this debate.
I have a wife and I've got two college-aged daughters.
And I'll tell you, it was like watching hyenas descend on a carcass when that box arrived.
And I've got a couple of just comments that they made here.
I want to share some personal feedback from this.
They have not asked me to do this.
But my daughter, who's heading off to college in the fall, this is what she had to say.
She said, "Their products were lightweight on my skin and worked well together,
and the good quality ingredients make them gentle on sensitive skin."
My daughter, who just graduated from college, said, "The body oil is great."
And my wife said, "I really love the products, super high quality,
and my skin feels great after using it for just a week."
Thanks so much for the folks again at Intera Skincare for making this debate possible tonight.
Alright, gentlemen, we're back to the discussion.
We're getting to gold real quick.
But right before that, how serious is the erosion of the US dollar's status as the petrodollar?
How truly at risk is it?
Folks have been reading a lot of the headlines recently,
and there's a fair amount of people out there that say so goes the petrodollar status,
so goes everything for the US dollar.
Bob, why don't we start with you?
Well, yeah, I think in general, just kind of going along with what everyone is saying here,
we all seem to agree that I think it's a very big deal and shouldn't be underestimated.
Just the US sanctions, and I've talked with lots of people in the financial sector,
and they did think, wow, that really is a qualitative step that they took.
And so in general, yes, I think all these different players are looking ahead,
even if they don't have any particular animosity towards the US and just understanding
we don't want to be in this position ten years from now,
and so let's start taking measures to get out.
Just very quickly, using the purchasing power parity method,
that's one way of evaluating different GDPs in different currencies or markets.
China was already bigger than the US in 2016 by that particular metric,
not in terms of market exchange rates.
So I think some of the people at home may not be fully appreciating that as the BRICs,
as they grow just within their own domestic internal economies,
they can be performing operations in there.
And so, yes, the reliance and having to go through this system that came out of the 1970s,
I just think we all agree at some point it doesn't need to be like that forever.
Jim and I are just arguing, okay, well, you know, empires end,
and it's going to happen sooner than I think our opponents in this debate think.
Okay. Brett?
What's the question again?
How concerned are you about the loss of petrodollar status?
We've been seeing an erosion of the petrodollar status of late.
Is that something that particularly worries you from a dollar-dominant standpoint?
It really doesn't, and I don't say that to say that it's not an important issue.
It's incredibly important, but think about Saudi Arabia
and where they were and where they are now.
Fifty years ago, they were a desert kingdom,
and the House of Saud was not entirely sure that they would remain the ruler of Saudi Arabia,
and they made a deal with the United States, the global hegemon at the time,
to price their product in dollars,
and in exchange, they got protection from the global hegemon
that ensured that their family would stay in charge,
and their desert kingdom became one of the most modern societies in the world
from a technological standpoint--highways, shopping malls, airports, movie theaters--
and they now have one of the highest standards of living in the world as a result of that deal.
The idea that they are just going to, on a whim, stop doing business with the United States
and bring in a new partner to keep their standard of living at that level or higher,
and that they are going to take that risk with the full knowledge
that not only will the United States steal reserves,
but they will also use their military when necessary.
Does anybody actually think that Saudi Arabia would be able to ditch the dollar
and go to be partners with China or Russia,
and there wouldn't be blowback from the United States?
And in that blowback, what would happen to their standard of living,
and what would happen to global markets,
and what would happen to the U.S. dollar in that scenario?
I argue that that would send the dollar to catastrophic heights.
It would lead to devastation of the Middle East.
It would kick off a global war that would--I don't know how long it would last.
It probably wouldn't last very long because it would be that significant.
But the idea that the petro dollar is going to become the petro yuan
or the petro ruble or the petro banker, and the U.S. is just going to say,
"Okay, no problem. We had a good run, and it's all over."
I think that is the height of naivete about what the United States is capable of.
All right, so you raised another question I was going to get to
that maybe I could combine with this question for Michael and Jim's answers,
which is the U.S. is unlikely to idly sit by should indeed the dollar's status
as the world's reserve currency become seriously threatened.
And so my question for you all is how is the empire most likely to strike back
and protect its interests here?
Maybe you might have some ideas on that, Brian.
Well, the easiest thing they can do is raise interest rates.
This is exactly what they did over the last 18 months,
and it devastated many parts of the rest of the world.
The dollar is the original stealth weapon.
They can influence economies, lifestyles, livelihoods all over the world
with Jay Powell saying two words.
Okay, so let's say Jim's right for a second,
and the BRICS currencies reveal this competing currency,
and they've got all the infrastructure in there to get it going.
Would that be your sense of the U.S.'s next chess move?
The idea that the U.S. would not react to that, in my opinion, is ridiculous.
Of course they would react to that.
Michael, do you want to go before or after Jim when I ask Jim this question?
I'll go before and I'll be very quick.
I completely agree with what Brent just said.
I'm saying that a lot tonight.
Five and a half percent is quite a powerful weapon already.
It has really, really been destabilizing for a lot of the rest of the world,
and they are absolutely terrified at the prospect of six or six and a half.
Now, of course, by the way, that's not a forecast in any way, shape, or form,
but were that to happen, would that cause problems here?
Sure.
Absolutely.
But you have your own liquidity.
You have your own magic acronyms like BTFP,
which you can use to try and temporarily keep this crazy machine rolling on.
They don't have any version of that in Europe or in Eurasia
or anywhere else you're thinking about, and were that to happen,
everyone who's sitting there saying, okay,
so I've got these potential magic beans which might turn into something amazing
at some point and free me from vassalhood versus the U.S.,
which hasn't really emerged yet, but oh, six percent on my money over here,
and I want a cash in my pocket to go and spend wherever I want in the world
with no questions asked, six percent wins.
And to put things in a--
And you get to continue selling into our markets.
Yeah, exactly, but to flip it around the other way,
because I genuinely, genuinely value an awful lot of what the other side is saying,
and I don't want anyone to think that I'm poo-pooing it all.
I really do, but were the Fed to go the other route,
as Wall Street is now salivating for--
In fact, I said this morning they're riding a wave of their own saliva
or surfing it and think that we're going to go back to a zero interest rate policy.
If you do that, advantage your team.
Absolutely advantage your team if the Federal Reserve thinks they can get away
with doing that in the current world environment.
I don't think they've realized yet that they're actually boxed in and they can't,
but when they do, then I think Brent's absolutely right,
and the easiest thing you do is just say,
"We can live with this interest rate, thank you very much,"
and that will slow down the process that you guys are talking about hugely, hugely.
All right, Jim, your reaction to that?
Yeah, I don't have to respond to everything Michael said,
because the Fed's irrelevant.
They put it on a good show, but they don't matter.
A ten-year note, yield to maturity matters, but not what the Fed does.
That's just kind of for show.
I was in the White House in 1974 meeting with Helmut Sonnenfeld
planning the invasion of Saudi Arabia.
Helmut was Kissinger's deputy, he was deputy national security advisor.
His nickname, he was Kissinger's Kissinger.
He was actually one of the big brains behind all this,
and we had a good cop, bad cop routine.
We had William Simon, Jerry Parsky.
We're going to go to Saudi Arabia and say,
"Hey, if you sell your oil for dollars and take the dollars and put it in the U.S. bank,
we can lend it to South America, they can buy our stuff."
It all works pretty well, but if you don't, we will invade just part of Saudi Arabia,
the oil fields, create a security perimeter.
We won't steal all the oil, we'll pump it, we'll sell it at a price we dictate.
We'll hold the money and trust for you, you'll get it eventually,
but we're going to control the oil and control the world price.
So it was a good cop, bad cop routine.
I was on the bad cop team, but we leaked it to the Chicago Tribune,
and it was a big headline with maps and everything,
and the Saudis got the message and they went along.
The problem with rerunning that movie today,
and I think Brent's kind of living in the past as far as this is concerned,
the U.S. does not have that kind of military power.
We don't even have 155 millimeter artillery shells.
The reason we're giving the Ukrainian neo-Nazis the cluster bombs
is because we don't have any regular artillery shells.
The Russian economy is completely mobilized, they're on a war footing,
they're producing millions of shells per year,
the U.S. can barely produce 100,000 a month.
We're begging, going hand in hand to South Korea, begging them for shells.
NATO's completely depleted, the famous Challenger tanks from the U.K.,
they got to the battlefield, they were blown up, the Leopard tanks were blown up.
The Pentagon called Ukraine and said, hey, we sent you some Abrams tanks,
please don't use them in combat because they'll get blown up too,
and that's really bad for sales.
So that's the state of the U.S. military today.
We can't meet our recruiting goals, our arsenals are depleted,
we can spend money, but then that gets back to the inflationary scenarios
and interest rate scenarios we talked about.
So we failed in Iraq, we failed in Afghanistan,
we killed some terrorist leaders, nice job,
but you could have done that with a couple hundred people, not millions.
But we failed in Iraq, we failed in Saudi Arabia, sorry, in Afghanistan,
we're failing in Syria, three Americans killed Jordan the other day.
We can't bomb the Houthis, the Houthis are living in caves.
They've closed the Suez Canal.
The Houthis are living in caves, they've closed the Suez Canal.
You can't beat the Houthis, but somehow you think you can take on Saudi Arabia
and cram the dollar down your throat?
You don't think the United States military can beat the Houthis?
Just so we're clear, is that what you're saying?
No.
You don't think the U.S. can beat the Houthis?
No.
Can I jump in?
Good luck.
It's all yours.
Did we beat the Taliban?
We handed over Iraq to Iran, we couldn't beat the Taliban,
we couldn't beat the Syrians, we failed at everything.
No, we can't beat the Houthis.
Can I reply to that?
I agree with you.
I agree with everything you've just said.
And I agree, it would be very, very hard to beat the Houthis.
It's a very condescending view to look at the Houthis.
You know what the price of Lockheed Martin has done in the last ten years?
Oh, I don't doubt the Lockheed.
I recommend Lockheed Martin.
I recommend defense contractors and big oil.
Do you think none of the goals-
What does Lockheed Martin have to do with beating the Houthis?
It has to do with Afghanistan and it has to do with Iraq.
Do you think-
We lost in those places.
Did we?
Yes, we did.
Did Lockheed Martin lose?
Did Raytheon lose?
Do you want to talk about the U.S. military or Lockheed Martin?
No, Jim, why do you always get to change but I don't get to?
Why do you get to have your own facts but I don't get to?
The fact is the military industrial complex has made trillions of dollars-
We're not talking about that.
We're talking about the U.S. military ability to beat the Houthis.
The military industrial complex-
We're talking about the Houthis, we can't beat the Houthis.
We couldn't beat the Taliban.
I will go on record and say if we needed to,
the United States could beat the Houthis.
Jim is on the other side of that.
You can't beat the Russians and Ukraine.
Our cells are depleted.
Our equipment doesn't work.
The Patriots can't shoot a hypersonic missile but you can beat the Houthis.
The United States had hypersonic technology in the 1960s
and abandoned it for better technology.
Okay, so we don't have it, okay?
Because we have something better.
How do you think the military industrial complex gets a bigger budget every year?
We say we don't have any arsenal.
We say we don't have any capabilities.
We say Russia and China are way ahead of us and the senators write the checks.
That's the way it works.
And waste the money and the military is weaker than ever.
Well, I want to bridge this between you guys and what we were talking about earlier, which is this.
I really agree with the point you're making specifically here.
And the way I try and frame it, if you're looking at a reserve currency,
it isn't just about the fiscal, which we started with,
and we don't think is as important when we look at the totality of it globally
because we're looking at the financial, which is the second one.
Do you have a network of everyone using it, which is the euro dollar?
And other currencies don't have that.
But the key one for me is the physical.
The fiscal, the financial, and then the physical.
And does the U.S. have raw materials, capital, et cetera,
everything you would need to be number one?
Yes.
Does it have that applied the way it needs to right now to produce ammunition, et cetera, et cetera?
I think we can agree regardless of what the potential is right now
compared to what the draw could be versus China, versus Russia, versus Iran,
which is what the U.S. is talking about.
No, there isn't enough right now.
And were the U.S., A, as we were saying with the Fed,
to cut interest rates back to zero, were it to do that,
and were it to say our defense complex is absolutely fine and dandy,
we don't need to change a thing,
then I do agree that the door starts to open to some of the scenarios
that you guys are talking about, but not from the financial front,
or the fiscal front that you're talking about, a very different one, the physical front.
So we have to watch that carefully.
But if you do see what I expect, which would be a U.S. structural pivot,
back to producing things again, particularly for the military-industrial complex,
whether or not you fight wars is irrelevant, you just need the stuff.
I think they can pivot there.
And one last very quick point on Saudi Arabia.
I didn't know that, and it's fascinating about you being the bad cop in that conversation.
That was pretty cool.
Very, very cool. The man in black suits you.
But we wouldn't need, or the U.S. wouldn't need to invade Saudi Arabia.
The U.S. is the world's largest oil producer right now.
So it wouldn't need to do that.
The petrodollar in terms of the U.S. buying Saudi oil
and the Saudis reinvesting that back in the U.S. is irrelevant.
You're the net energy exporter.
But the physical side is still important, and I agree with you on that.
But I don't think the petrodollar side is important the way that it used to be.
It's yesterday's news.
Let me make just one last quick point.
Because we do have to move on to the points, but go ahead.
Can I do a 10?
Yes.
Literally 10.
Just to be clear, I don't think that in the scenarios that I've talked about
that the United States has it easy and it's a cakewalk.
You know, it is going to hurt, and it's going to hurt bad.
I just feel like the United States still has enough, you know, advantages
that the Trump, you know, without using the Trump word.
I've swore to myself I wasn't going to use the Trump word.
You fell for it. You fell for it.
The Trump, a lot of the disadvantages that the rest of the world has,
and so I'll just leave it at that.
Hey, we're just biding our time over here.
Oh, geez.
I understand, you know, the disagreement in terms of the Houthis.
Let me just ask you, just point blank, because you surprised me.
Are you saying you think in a meaningful sense
the U.S. military succeeded in Afghanistan?
I don't think succeed is the right way.
If the United States wanted to wipe Afghanistan off the map,
they could have done it.
They could have done it in 24 hours.
They didn't choose to do that.
And I'm not even saying that they did a good job there,
but I'm also saying that, you know, these ideas--
I mean, literally every time the U.S. gets involved in something,
whether it's Iraq or Afghanistan or whatever it is,
people always say the U.S. can't win a war.
Really?
If it really comes down to it, you don't think the United States can win a war?
The Taliban are in charge of Afghanistan.
Do we win?
You're right. Maybe there's moral, public, you know--
Iran controls Iraq. They're not killers.
Assad is still president of Syria.
From your perspective, Jim, maybe it's not me.
From the military industrial complex, maybe it is.
I'm not talking about the military industrial complex.
I'm talking about winning wars. That's different.
In your opinion, if the goal was to win the war, maybe so.
But maybe that wasn't their goal.
You're holding up and saying the U.S. military will hold up the dollar.
That's a good comment.
And so if they had a string of failures,
and perhaps because, right, we didn't have the stomach to just nuke everyone.
Are they going to do that to uphold the dollar to be above 50%?
Sure.
I don't know about 50%.
All right, but it seems like you're saying the case is everyone's going to hold the dollar
because otherwise we're going to kill them.
The idea that we're dropping nuclear weapons in foreign exchange markets
or trading normally, and if we have currency, that's absurd.
Well, on the question of--
I would just encourage anybody to go back,
and if any military operation over the last 30 years,
go to the global markets and see what the dollar index did during this.
It's not what we're talking about.
It is what we're talking about.
You're talking about nuking Afghanistan.
Jim.
Yeah, you said we want to blow--
Actually, listen to what I'm saying.
I listened to exactly what you're saying.
If we wanted to wipe Afghanistan off the map, we could do it.
That's what you said.
You don't think we could have?
Yeah, of course we could.
That's called World War III.
We don't throw weapons.
That's how you do it.
And you like the dollar in that world?
There's not going to be any currency.
There's going to be gold and silver.
All right.
Cockroaches and share.
That may be a good transition to get to gold here.
Very quickly before we do, and I might be making a mistake here,
but we've got two big questions that I want to make sure we get to
before we have to wrap up and get to Q&A,
which is coming here faster than we all expected it would.
One of them is the gold topic.
The other one is the dollar versus real things story.
So the dollar's purchasing power versus things,
not other fiat currencies.
Now, I want to get your guys' thoughts on that.
I think you'll probably be much more in alignment on that,
but we'll find out.
But I also want to find out if, indeed,
you think the dollar's going to perform poorly
in terms of its future purchasing power,
what assets you think concerned investors might want to consider
putting their dollars into to protect against that.
But before we get there, I want to ask a question about Bitcoin,
and I'm going to combine it with the CBDC question,
just because they're sort of a similar feather,
which is do you think that central bank digital currencies are definitely coming,
and what do you think their impact will be on existing monetary arrangements?
And for extra points in your answer,
if you can give any clarity on your thoughts on Bitcoin
and the role it might play in the potential monetary structure going forward,
please try to do that.
Bob, let's start with you.
Okay. So really quickly,
I think part of the reason I think these events can happen much more quickly
than the people on the other couch here is our company Infinio,
part of what we're doing is building out blockchain solutions,
taking real-world assets, tokenizing them.
And household names, big banks that you've heard of, they're doing this stuff.
So I think this is coming sooner than a lot of people realize.
And so in that type of world where, yes, more and more things are digital,
I think it's going to be a lot easier to say, well, gee,
how could these people over here possibly coordinate their commerce?
I think it's just going to be a lot easier
if a lot of the commerce is all happening more digitally.
So that's one element.
Yeah, I think Bitcoin is a great--
you're in some country where there's an authoritarian rule
and you're trying to get out, you just memorize your password or your key,
and then you can cross the border.
I don't have any assets. What are you talking about?
You just remember something.
So I think that's a great use case of things like Bitcoin.
CBDCs, yeah, there's a war on cash.
I don't think that's for the reasons the academic economists are giving.
I think it's because they want to control more.
But in one sense it's ironic because I think as the world moves toward that,
then people will also look at market-based alternatives.
And again, I think one of the alternatives to these state-issued fiat currencies
is more market-based ones in the future.
I think that's going to be more of a viable alternative,
even though now it seems like science fiction.
Okay. Brett or Michael, either one of you two guys want to go?
I mean, I'll jump in.
I mean, these are very muddy waters, and as Nietzsche said,
they muddy the waters to make them look deep.
Sometimes there's something there and sometimes there really isn't anything there.
I do suspect if we see CBDCs going forward, let's keep it as if for now,
they're going to be overtly political. I'm completely with you on that.
And I would estimate the only need for rolling them out
is to move towards a more planned economy, which I suspect we will see,
because to link to a thesis I've had for some time now,
when we're talking about Fed funds and saying five and a half helps the dollar
versus BRICS rivals, which I think it does,
but a lot of the U.S. economy requires zero.
For example, the Pentagon, so you can actually start building things again
rather than paying money on interest.
My thesis is actually they'll end up using a CBDC of some form to do both.
So you've got programmable money, which is hypothecated,
that can only go here, not anywhere else,
which actually is how the Soviet economy worked, if you remember that.
You couldn't use it anywhere except where it was allocated.
And by doing that, you will kind of jerry-rig a rather ugly, crude system,
which will be used to try and physically keep the U.S. in a position
where it can remain top dog regardless of what the fiscal metrics look like.
Now, is that ugly? Yeah.
Do I like the idea of it? God, no.
Do I think it's still going to happen,
where you have a five and a half percent interest rate for irrelevant areas
and zero percent interest rate for the ones which have national security implications?
I think it's largely unavoidable at some point,
largely because China is already doing a version of it,
and you can't possibly compete in a national security sense with free markets
or money brought to you by K-Mart when you're dealing with an entity
which has got such a planned economy aiming at physical production,
aiming to push you off the world stage, which is how some in the Pentagon see it.
So I think that national security crisis can lead to a revolution
in terms of how we do things, which will shake up everything for all of us
in terms of how we understand it.
And I'm not happy at the prospect.
You're not going to get me signing a document saying this is the best thing since sliced bread.
Far from it.
But the national security implications lead me to believe that's probably where it's headed
rather than an interesting investment portfolio structure for someone trading at home.
It may be that, too, but I think it's much more about making sure that people who need guns have them in their hands.
Michael, I'm going to ask you an unfair question that I'm going to ask everybody on this topic,
which is just take your best guesstimate timeframe in years
of when you think CBDCs will be deployed at material scale.
Something we'll see in the next couple of years? Is it a decade or two decades off? What do you think?
Who wins the next election?
Yeah, I mean, openly, if you look at it, Trump has said there will never be a digital dollar.
So if he wins, that's not going to happen.
And I don't think anyone else will dare to do it in the Western camp before the US.
They'll get everything ready. They'll get all the technology ready,
but I don't think they'll want to launch it if the US isn't going to.
But if Biden wins, potentially. He hasn't said anything clearly about it,
but it would certainly sit more comfortably with the more technocratic approach
that we've seen in terms of the CHIPS Act, the IRA, etc., etc., etc.
Why not do that with programmable money where you can try and control the economy as much as you want?
So maybe we're in agreement on that. I don't know.
All right. Bob, I just wanted to give you a chance to give timing.
Sure. So if we're talking about the US, and here I'm cribbing, I like George Gammon's take on this.
I don't think there's going to be a Fed coin anytime soon because 40% of the country would recoil in horror.
But what you might see is a continued of the trend of consolidation, smaller banks going under, bigger banks,
and then they're more hand in glove with the Fed.
I'm in total agreement with you there.
100%. This is anecdotal, but when I go to the ATM and the amount that it suggests maybe I want to take out
has gone down over time, even though that amount purchases less.
And so there really is this concerted effort to wean this from using currency, paper,
and I think you're just going to see that.
So it's not going to be perhaps literally a CBDC, but moving Americans towards that.
I think it's happening right now.
Okay. Brent, you want to add anything on this?
No, I'll stick with Bob on that one.
Okay. Jim, I want to get to gold.
So do you have any particularly strongly felt thoughts around this topic?
I know you do around CBDCs.
Yeah. I mean, I could talk at length about CBDCs,
but you asked everyone to drop a footnote on cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin in particular.
I studied it for 12 years or actually longer.
And other than smuggling and tax evasion, it has no use case.
It's a novelty.
It took me a very-- I understand the technology.
I read the papers. I get the math.
But it took me a very long time to figure out what it actually is, or at least a good analog.
And to me, it's a casino chip.
I went to the casino, put $1,000 down on the roulette table.
They give me my chips. I gamble.
I can win or lose. At the end of the night, I take my chips over to the cashier.
I get dollars, and I walk outside.
If I walk outside with the chips, they're worthless.
I can't buy a cup of coffee with those chips.
So if you're in the crypto world, you can trade it.
By the way, there's very good research, rigorous research by MIT scholars
that shows that over 90% of the Bitcoin transactions are wash trades.
It's just a small number of whales moving back and forth.
It's like Kennedy and others ramping stocks in the 1920s.
It's also hallucinogenic in the sense that people see what they want to see.
So it's kind of a clown world. It's a form of entertainment.
I know people have made $20, $40 million, paid their taxes, and walked away.
So that's real, but there are a lot of people committing suicide because of what they've lost.
So to me, it's a joke. It's not going anywhere.
Now, let's talk about CBDCs because that's real.
So right now, let's say I go to an airport. I want to buy a candy bar.
I use my credit card. What does the merchant do with the credit card receipt?
Well, they sell it to someone called a merchant acquirer who bundle up all these receivables.
The merchant acquirer will take hundreds of millions of these receivables,
deliver them to MasterCard or Visa, get paid.
MasterCard or Visa then sends them out to all the banks who issue the cards.
The bank sends me a bill and I pay it.
You've got five intermediaries for one candy bar.
For me, the merchant, the merchant acquirer, the MasterCard, Visa, and the bank, fees all along the way.
So the case for CBDCs, which are not cryptocurrencies, by the way.
I disagree with your point, Adam, that it's kind of like crypto. They're not.
The message traffic is encrypted, but that's been true since the '70s.
But the key to CBDCs is you've got to get rid of cash.
I agree with Bob on that because that is an alternative.
But the most important thing about that, I agree with everything Michael said,
but there's something far worse just below the surface.
They always sell it on the basis of convenience.
But right now, if I buy a book, I make a political contribution, I make a religious contribution,
I get to a charity, I go to a certain event, et cetera, that's all private.
Now, if you're under investigation, they get a subpoena, that's one thing, but that's all private.
Where the government maintains the ledger, which is what CBDCs are, they will know all of that.
They will know the books you buy, the churches you go to,
the FBI is investigating Catholics who go to try to contain masses,
which have been around since the 16th century.
So that's an example of how bad the government is at this stage.
But they'll have all that information.
You apply artificial intelligence to that database, you can profile the individuals,
go back to Biden's speech in Independence Hall in September 2022 ahead of the midterm elections,
stage managed by the ghost of Lenny Reifenstahl because of the blood red pillars and the military guards.
And it was right out of the Nuremberg rallies.
They probably owe royalties for that.
But he basically identified 50% of the Americans and said, "You are enemies of the people.
You are MAGA Republicans," et cetera.
So combine that rhetoric, which is heartfelt in the White House,
with artificial intelligence and having the ledger and knowing everything you buy,
every contribution you make, you're in Brave New World.
It's not like, "Oh, it's coming," or "Let's look for it."
You're actually there.
Maybe they're not waiting for that because the FBI basically got a lot of records
from Bank of America the other day about whether you shop at Dick's Sporting Goods,
Cabela's, or Bass Pro Shops because they sell guns and ammo.
It used to be, by the way, when you went into Cabela's and bought something,
there was a code that the credit card companies used.
It was just sporting goods.
The government required them to break out guns and ammo.
So if you buy a kayak, good for you.
So they're already tracing this stuff. They're already violating the First Amendment,
the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment.
It's going to get a lot worse under central bank digital currencies.
Thank goodness for Trump. He's going to stop it in his tracks.
I agree with Michael.
Whether it happens or not in the next six years depends entirely on whether Trump becomes president,
so that's a good reason to support him.
Okay. All right. Well, look, we're now at the gold topic.
Jim, I know you've got big thoughts on it,
so I'm going to give everybody else a chance to go,
and then we're going to let you make whatever case you want to make
that hasn't been addressed by the current speakers here.
Bob, why don't I start with you again?
So what type of role do you see gold as playing in the monetary system going forward?
So as I said earlier, even according to the official statistics,
and Dominic Frisbee is somebody that if people want to look him up,
he's made the case that China is actually holding much higher gold reserves
than they're letting on, and you might say, "Why would they do that?"
Because they don't want to shock things.
They're just content to sit back in his theory and just let the U.S. squander its position.
So again, it's incontrovertible.
Russia and China have vastly increased their gold holdings,
and I think that reassures investors whatever sorts of things they want to lay out in the future,
whether they're going to explicitly back it or just to have that in your central bank holdings.
I think everyone knows if a crisis breaks out, would you rather be holding a bunch of paper
or claims to, "Oh, no, this allows me in ten years.
Someone will send me paper at that point," or yellow metal.
I think gold has stood the test of time and that everyone knows if a crisis breaks out,
yes, having a strong military would be good,
but also having a bunch of gold in your reserves is going to be good as well.
All right.
Mr. Dollar Milkshake, what sort of role do you see gold potentially being able to play going forward?
Well, I've always said that I think gold is the most important asset that anybody can own.
I think it should be the bedrock of every portfolio.
I think everybody should own it in some capacity.
What the right allocation is really dependent upon what other assets they have in their portfolio,
what kind of liquidity they have, what kind of income they have.
But for many of the reasons that Bob just said and what we're talking about here today,
fiat currency loses value over time.
Again, anybody with any cursory knowledge of financial history knows that,
and gold cannot be inflated away and it cannot be deflated to zero.
So surely there's a place for that somewhere in your portfolio.
Now, that doesn't mean that gold is going to go to $5,000 tomorrow night.
I've said for a long time that I think gold will ultimately go to $5,000.
I still believe that.
But I don't think it will happen overnight, and I don't really care if it happens overnight.
I'm confident when there is a crisis in the United States and the dollar loses a lot of value,
then gold will go up.
So I think that's a good reason to have it.
But to me, that's a totally separate argument
than kind of the main topic we're talking about tonight about the dollar versus--
So the question was do you see it playing a role in the monetary system going forward
different from its role today?
I think it plays as an official role in the monetary system only as a very last resort.
But I think it plays a role in the monetary system.
Central banks own gold.
Banks own gold.
People own gold.
That influences the monetary system.
But as far as an official gold-backed currency or a gold-backed bank or BRICS currency,
I think it will be floated, but I don't think it actually comes to be for a very long time.
Okay. Michael?
I'll just make one very simple point, which I tried to make before,
but I think it's easier done in this simple context,
that when you look at the countries that are increasing their gold holdings,
which is happening, absolutely, and I think it is to try and avoid sanctions.
I agree.
All of them, if you run through the list, all the major ones are net exporters
and quite large net exporters.
They're not net exporters to each other per se, but they're all net exporters.
How does that work?
Because we know, as you said, it's a zero-something, net exporter must equal net importer.
Where is this going to balance?
Now, I'm not going to dive into that right now, but it's just a question to pose to you.
It's what suggests to me it can't work much above and beyond what Brent just alluded to.
It's a simple dynamic, but it's true.
Russia, big net exporter. China, big net exporter.
Iran, Turkey, et cetera. Just go down the list.
And so that's balance sheet problematic, we have to admit.
Jim, I appreciate you listening quietly through all that.
I know you have a lot to say. Let's hear it.
Maybe not so much.
I tried listing my gold powers five times, and Michael managed to squash that,
so I'm not going to waste any more time on that.
I will post it on my Twitter feed, @JamesGRicards.
So you go to my Twitter feed, @JamesGRicards, I'll list the gold powers and maybe some surprises.
China's really a pygmy.
In terms of weight of gold, yes, they have quite a bit,
and certainly more than they reveal, but the percentage of GDP is really quite small.
A lot of people are surprised to learn that the United States has a reserve position.
70% of U.S. reserves are in gold, so that's another fun fact that a lot of people don't appreciate.
There is not one central bank in the world that wants a gold standard.
Why would they? They have a monopoly.
They print money of whatever kind, or they've swapped lines or whatever.
Why on earth would they want a gold standard? They wouldn't.
We'll get to a gold standard of some sort.
It may just be a gold link, just to be clear, not because anybody wants it,
but because confidence in the U.S. dollar, in particular, in fiat currency,
they're all in the same life.
The dollar, the euro, the yen, maybe the Swiss francs is in a separate category,
but most of the major countries, they're all in the life of it.
They're all going to survive together, or they're going to sink.
My view is they're going to sink.
When you talk about the dollar strong or the dollar weak,
one of my favorite jazz songs, it was a great rendition at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1969.
It's called "Compared to What."
People talk about strong dollar, weak dollar, and I say, "Time out."
Compared to what? What are you actually talking about?
Because the dollar could go up against the yen, which it has,
or go down against the euro or vice versa, or up against both or down against both.
You need a yardstick, and there's only one yardstick for fiat currency
that's not a fiat currency, which is gold.
So if you want to know whether the dollar is strong or weak, and it can be both,
and a strong dollar is problematic, I agree with Brent on that,
just look at the dollar price of gold.
It actually has been pretty flat for a while.
It did have a rally a couple years ago, but it's been pretty flat recently,
which is sort of amazing considering all the fiscal and deficit problems
that the United States actually has.
What that tells me is that you can actually have a situation
where the dollar is strong relative to fiat,
and gold is strong relative to the dollar at the same time.
That can't exist.
That's the milkshake.
Well, that's not exactly where we are now
because gold hasn't shot up to $3,000 or more, which it will get to.
Look, right now in the short run, the dollar is very strong
because there's a global dollar shortage.
Countries are desperate for dollars.
China, above all, interest rates are going to crash.
They're going to be down.
The 10-year note yielded maturity was down around 2% on another six months.
We're just not there yet.
There's a little backup from the rally in prices in December.
But gold is in all the major central bank reserves.
It's a growing percentage of many.
They stopped selling.
2010 was the inflection point.
The US never sold an ounce of gold after 1980.
There's a reason for that, by the way,
which we don't have time to get into having to do with the gold certificate at the Fed.
But we got the British to dump over half their gold in the late 1990s.
We got Switzerland to dump 1,000 tons in the early 2000s.
We got the IMF to dump 400 tons around 2010.
We got everyone else to kind of do our bidding and keep dumping gold,
but that's over central banks or net buyers.
Gold reserves are going up.
That doesn't mean a gold standard overnight, but it's certainly heading in that direction.
And it will happen very, very quickly because confidence is lost very, very quickly.
Everything works fine along the lines Brent was describing as long as confidence is there.
This is what Janet Yellen and other Treasury secretaries, the White House,
Christine Lagarde, none of them understand.
They take confidence for granted.
And when you lose confidence, it can be lost very quickly, and it's impossible to regain.
And that's the world where gold triumphs.
All right. Gentlemen, thank you.
We're beginning to wrap it up here.
And folks watching, we're going to get to the user Q&A in just a couple of minutes.
I do want to make it very practical for folks, though, as we wind up here.
So to this topic about the purchasing power of the US dollar versus the things that we care about,
the essentials of living, the things that we just go out and transact with on a daily basis.
I don't want to put words in your mouth, panel, but from comments you've all made,
I believe you think that the dollar is going to lose its purchasing power versus real things
moving forward from here in some material way.
If you could just share your trajectory on that, whether you think we're going to sort of see
the same loss of purchasing power in the dollar that, say, we've seen in the past two, two and a half years.
That would be great if you want to expound on how fast you think it's going to lose its purchasing power.
But maybe even more relevant for people, for those who are concerned about a loss of US dollar purchasing power,
what wealth protection strategies would you think is worth them considering?
Brent, I know you get asked this question a lot, so why don't I start with you?
Sure. Well, so at the very beginning of the introductory, I spoke that I kind of coined this dollar milkshake theory
in order way for me to help understand how I thought the years ahead would play out.
In 2018, I said in the years ahead, we will see the US dollar rise versus foreign currencies.
We will see gold rise, and we will see US equities rise, and that altogether is the milkshake.
And if you think about it, but I also said it's going to be characterized by terrifying drawdowns along the way.
And the reason I put that disclaimer in there is because based on the design of the system
and the debt-based system, there is always the danger of deflationary shocks.
If money doesn't circulate, if for whatever reason people stop spending and money doesn't circulate,
money disappears and asset prices collapse. But in response to that, the central banks, the monetary authorities,
the governments of the world will come in and they will do QE, they will stimulate, they will print money,
however you want to describe that, and then that will push asset prices higher again.
So I think in the years ahead, asset prices will rise versus the US dollar.
They will rise even more versus other currencies, but I think they will rise versus the US dollar.
But it will be characterized by terrifying drawdowns along the way.
And so I don't think that everybody should be completely out of dollars
and all in on either Bitcoin or gold or equities, whatever it is.
I think everybody should own gold. I think everybody should own large cap US equities
because I think they will go a lot higher in the years ahead, especially if we get into a sovereign debt crisis
and sovereign bonds get repudiated.
But I think everybody should have some kind of a nest egg on the sideline,
whether you want to call it dry powder or cash on the sidelines or some kind of a rainy day fund
to take advantage of these terrifying drawdowns that will inevitably come.
And so I don't think anybody should be all in on one thing.
When I talk to people and they're either all in on Bitcoin or all in on gold or all in on equities or whatever it is,
and they're just so certain of it, it's so surprising to me.
I've been doing this for 25 years and I'm not certain about anything.
So the idea that somebody can be so certain on one asset to me is just--
I don't think we're in an environment where I think certainty is death, to be honest.
So I think you need to kind of be prepared for everything.
And if you're prepared for everything, here's the other reason why to be prepared for everything
and to have a little bit of cash on the sideline, even if you think dollars are losing value.
Because if we do get into one of these terrifying drawdowns and you're all in already and your asset,
even if long term-- let's use gold as an example.
Even though you know long term it's going to come back,
if it's down 20% or 30% over a week period because we're in a liquidation event, you're going to be stressed.
And if you're stressed, you're not going to think clearly.
And if you're not thinking clearly, you're not going to make a good decision.
So even though holding some cash may be a drag from an inflationary standpoint in the short term,
having that cash on the sidelines will give you some peace of mind
and allow you to think clearer in a deflationary pullback.
And I think that will allow you to capitalize and make much more than the slow drag of inflation on the cash in the meantime.
All right. Thanks, Brent.
And you're a capital manager. That's one of the differentiators of you here on the panel.
Did what you just described, is that reflective of how you currently have your client capital allocated?
Yeah. I mean, in every client-- I have a business where I customize--
I'm very lucky I work with a small number of very wealthy clients
and everybody has a customized portfolio to them so we don't run a model portfolio that everybody does the exact same thing.
But clients in our firm, we've got gold, we've got a lot of T-bills right now
because we think there's going to be an opportunity to buy things at better prices.
But we also own equities. We own U.S. equities, especially large-cap, blue-chip U.S. equities.
And we own some of the soft commodities. Those have not done well, admittedly,
but I think in the years ahead that food prices could go a lot higher, so we're holding those right now.
And again, we're kind of prepared for everything. I figured out a long time ago
that trying to be right all the time, you're ultimately going to be wrong at some point.
So rather than trying to be right all the time, just try to be prepared all the time.
And that's served me pretty well over the last couple decades.
Well said, Brent. Okay. Bob, how would your response be to the concerned holder of dollars right now?
Okay. Well, first, let me just have the disclaimer that I infamously lost an inflation bet back when QE was going on.
If you go to my Wikipedia article, I was born, and I lost an inflation bet, and I'm an Austrian.
That's the three things that will hit. So let me not make any specific quantitative predictions here,
but I do think, joking aside, we did see right after QE, like a bunch of people like Glenn Beck,
and he was going up on a forklift with the monetary base, and, oh, gas didn't go to $10 a gallon.
So I guess printing money doesn't matter. But then after 2020, then it seemed like,
oh, wait, maybe printing money does matter again.
So I think a huge difference is whether it's getting channeled in the financial sector versus to the average person.
So the experience of 2020, everyone getting the stimulus checks or STEMIs, they call them, on the street.
And what scares me is just how popular now the support for UBI has become.
And there's also Modern Monetary Theory, MMT, which is sort of justifying it.
And just one quick anecdote. I saw this thing. Someone said, oh, all these latest studies, they found it in Houston.
They did a pilot program. They gave people $1,000 a month.
They checked in six months later, and they reported an increase in life satisfaction.
Really? You don't say. And so, therefore, we should just print money and hand it out to everybody.
So that sort of mentality, yes, is that starts to take hold.
So my prediction about the long-term purchasing power of the U.S. dollar is it's going to be much lower.
And in the short term, though, yes, I also think there's going to be a big crash.
And as we've seen, when people panic, they rush to safety. So I'm not ruling out that the dollar could strengthen, particularly against other currencies in the near term.
But certainly, I think over time, this aberrate, you know, U.S. inflation is higher than what the Fed wanted.
I think people are going to keep moving the goalposts and that what the Fed wants is going to be a lot more lenient going forward because it's going to have to be.
All right. Great. Mr. Avery. I don't give investment advice, so I have to be really, really clear about that.
And I don't think you're going to get much better than what we've just heard.
But my personal view is if you look at the Wall Street average, they still think that the dollar will lose only 2 percent of value per year imminently.
They will get back to that 2 percent level and it will just stay there.
Let's just say that I'm a pessimist on that front.
Meaning you'll take the over?
I'll take the over on that. But that's my own personal view.
And in terms of how you survive that, I'm very conservative, you know, short end of the Treasury curve where you can still be at nearly 5.5 percent, which is a great place to be while you look and wait.
And if it's inflation, someone's making profits.
So, you know, just choose the right equities.
That's as vanilla as I'm going to get. And over to you.
Bring us home, Jim.
You mentioned the Fed, QE and stimulus in the same sentence, which is fascinating as a trifecta of complete failure and irrelevance.
QE has nothing to do with inflation.
You take the period from 2009 to 2019, the end of the Great Recession or whatever you want to call it, to just pre-COVID when that was kind of a weird 2020.
2009 to 2019, 10 years, the Fed balance sheet went from $800 billion to $5 trillion.
And there was no inflation. It was 1.6 percent core PCE year over year.
As I would say, it's a sad day when the central bank wants inflation and can't get it.
Average annualized growth over that period was 2.2 percent, our potential easily 3.5 during 1983, 1986.
We had 16 percent real growth in three years. That's growth. That's what America is capable of.
We grew at an average of 2.2 percent for 10 years in a world where money supply went from $800 billion to over $5 trillion.
It went a lot higher during COVID. So QE doesn't work. It's for show. Money supply does not cause inflation.
There are two things that do cause inflation. One is velocity.
So just about the Austrians, Austrians always talk about printing money, printing money. It's irrelevant.
If people spend money and lend and you get the turnover,
the velocity can take any money supply and multiply it into a very high GDP relative to output.
That can cause inflation. The other thing and the reason we got the inflation in 2022 was fiscal policy.
It was the spending. It was Trump and Biden.
Trump gave out $1,400 checks in June and then in December he gave out another $400 check or $600 check.
We got you $2,000. Biden said, "Watch me. I can top that." He gave out $1,600 checks.
Then you had the Infrastructure Act, the Build Back Better, et cetera.
We had a baseline budget deficit of about $1 trillion a year.
Baseline means no extras, no frills, nothing. But Trump put a trillion on top of it.
Biden put $2 trillion on top of that. We spent about $6 trillion in three years.
We're still spending at that level. That's what caused the inflation in 2022.
Which brings us back to the fiscal policy point we talked about, which is far more important in this debt to GDP ratio.
I promise not to talk about gold to GDP. So that ratio is 125 percent.
So here's the thing. And this is, again, this is all empirical. This is very well researched.
Carmen Reinhart, chief economist of the World Bank, formerly at Harvard, Ken Rogoff at Harvard,
they have done a ton of research that shows that you can have a positive Keynesian multiplier,
assuming you don't just burn the money, up to a 90 percent debt to GDP ratio.
That's why the Maastricht Treaty said 60 percent because they thought that was the danger zone.
In 1980 the U.S. was 30 percent, which is completely comfortable.
Talking about the debt as a number means nothing. 34 trillion, you have a big scary number.
You have to put it in the context of the GDP.
If I owe 50,000 on a MasterCard and if you make a couple hundred thousand a year, you just write a check.
If you make 20,000 a year, you're going bankrupt.
So the debt is irrelevant. It doesn't mean anything unless you put it in the context of the income.
Right now the U.S. is in the doom loop. And what I mean by that, and Reinhart and Rogoff show this,
when you go past 90 percent, when you borrow a dollar and spend a dollar, you get less than a dollar of GDP.
What does that mean? It means that the numerator is going up faster than the denominator.
The ratio is getting worse, and right now that ratio is 0.67 percent based on data from the fourth quarter.
I realize that's just one quarter of 2023, but that's how bad things are.
Now you cannot borrow your way out of the doom loop.
You cannot borrow and spend your way out of a debt crisis once your debt to GDP ratio is that high.
So what are the outcomes? And Reinhart and Rogoff looked at this.
Developed economies only, developing economies only, past 20 years, past 100 years.
They sliced the data every way they could, and they said it's one of three things.
There's either a default, which is the Argentina case, but that's when you borrow a dollar and print pesos.
So yeah, you're going to default. The U.S. will never default because we can just print the dollars.
The second one is restructuring, like IMF comes in, they change the debt, extend the terms, what they did to Greece in 2015.
The U.S. doesn't need to do that either because, again, we can print the dollars.
So what's the American way? Inflation. And that's how we're going to get out of it eventually.
But it's going to be very high inflation for a sustained period of time.
Now having said that, short run, short run meaning over the remainder of this year, maybe a little bit beyond,
I look for a strong disinflation, deflation, much lower interest rates, and a much stronger dollar.
But this debt, this fiscal trap that we're in, this doom loop as I described it,
where the more you spend, the worse the ratio gets, what it does do, it slows growth.
Independent of how it ends up, it slows growth. You're never going to get out of it except by inflation.
So that's what I would expect, and that's why you want gold.
Okay, so thank you for ending on an asset to Owen.
I imagine you wouldn't recommend just a 100% gold portfolio.
No, no, I recommend 10%.
So what other assets would you encourage people to consider?
Well, again, the key is diversification.
People roll their eyes and go, of course, diversification.
Everybody knows that, efficient frontier and all that.
But they actually don't know that because I run into people and they say,
well, I own 50 stocks in 10 different sectors, semiconductors, mining and minerals, et cetera.
I'm highly diversified.
And they go, no, you're not.
You may own 50 stocks, but you own one asset class, which are stocks which are not highly correlated when you don't care.
But when you do care, they are highly correlated.
So have a slice of stocks. That's fine.
Alternatives, gold, real estate, not commercial real estate right now, but just other income-producing real estate farms.
I like big oil because the greenish scam is falling apart as we speak.
And CO2 has no impact on the climate.
That science is bogus.
But the things that do are solar cycles, volcanoes, subduction occurrence.
There are things that affect climate over long periods of time, but not CO2.
So we're going to get back to that.
So big oil, and I like the defense contractors.
I don't like America's military posture.
Grant kept switching between the two.
Our military posture is awful, but the defense contractors will do well.
All right. Thanks, Bob.
I'm going to give you the last word here.
Yeah, I realized I forgot to add.
So, again, I'm not going to go pick stocks.
What I would say, though, is in terms of diversification, diversify your sources of income.
Like, you've got to remain nimble.
So if you were thinking about starting that side business, do it now.
If you were thinking about moving down south, if you're in the U.S.,
oh, I'm thinking I would get the wheels in motion.
You don't want to be trying to move to Puerto Rico when everyone else is trying to go there, too,
because Biden's changing the rules on you, or whoever.
Kamala Harris, President Michelle Obama, who knows?
So I would just say that if you're thinking about stuff, do it now,
not when everyone else is doing it because the crash has already hit.
All right. Well, gentlemen, look, thank you so much for this discussion.
Again, we're about to get to the live Q&A with the viewers.
I want to ask you guys two last questions, but they've got to be very, very tight.
So 15, 20-second answers, if you can.
The first question is -- and I think, Michael, you might have been the one to propose this --
which is, if you're wrong in your primary thesis for this debate,
where do you think you're most likely to be wrong?
And, Michael, since you proposed this question, I'll give you the first answer.
Yeah, the Fed keeps running ruinous foreign policy -- sorry.
The White House keeps running ruinous foreign policy.
The Fed cuts rates back to zero and thinks there's not going to be any impact.
Okay. We'll go around the table here. Brent?
I think the place that I'm wrong is if the U.S. decides to unilaterally, proactively devalue the dollar.
Okay. Bob?
A lot of my predictions are based on eventually investors are going to start seeing things the way I do,
and maybe they won't.
Okay. And, Jim?
If I'm wrong, the dollar will decline sharply well before 2030.
Okay. All right. Well, gentlemen, a very important last question here to wrap up this discussion.
Where can folks go to follow you in your work?
Jim, we'll start with you and go back to the direction.
Sure. RickardsWarRoom.com. RickardsWarRoom.com.
It's the landing page, and you'll find access to my newsletters and books and so forth.
So RickardsWarRoom.com.
All right. Bob?
I've been referring to the company I work for.
Its chief economist is Infineo.ai, where you can see a lot of those blockchain applications I've been alluding to.
Also, I'm the host of the Human Action Podcast at the Mises Institute.
All right. Brent?
You can find me on Twitter.
That's my preferred method of conversation with the public.
Santiago AU Fund, or you can just look up Santiago Capital.
The symbol is a white seashell.
I also have a weekly podcast that I do with my friend John Kutsmeda.
You can find us on YouTube. You can go to Milkshakes, Markets, and Madness.
And you can also find it on Twitter at @MilkshakesPod.
Wow. All right. That's a lot.
And Michael, I'm going with you.
Look for me on LinkedIn and on Twitter. I'm on both of them.
All right. Gentlemen, again, thank you so much.
You really left it all on the playing field.
Lots of great academic debates, a lot of real practical advice, especially there at the end for folks.
You had an awful lot of information, and I think I could have given you five hours,
and I'm not sure we would have gotten through it all.
I think you guys did a great job condensing it all for folks.
Now, folks, like I said, I'm promising that we're going to start taking live Q&A from the Premium Zero Hedge subscribers.
I've got some questions already here on the screen I'm about to ask.
Very quickly, we're going to have the final word from the sponsor, and here it is.
What does Big Pharma and the sick care industry hate most?
A defector from its ranks? A man on a mission to educate the public?
Someone who takes his or her health in their own hands?
Well, how about all the above?
Nick Andrews, founder of Intera Skincare, is a biochemical engineer by training,
MMA enthusiast, and mountain biker by night.
Oh, and one of the world's top peptides product formulators.
Nick's career began in Big Pharma, spending over 20 years as an engineer consultant and playing nice with the regulators.
But after sustaining injuries in a mountain biking accident in his late 20s where doctors told him he would have a limited shoulder movement for the rest of his life,
he used his biochemical knowledge to help rebuild and regenerate his own cartilage, increase mobility, and regain strength.
His ultimate success led him down the path of health and optimization using cutting-edge research.
Fast forward to his own skincare problems while practicing MMA, and Intera was born.
No more would he listen to dermatologists prescribe damning drugs with potent side effects with minimal results.
Nick's own formulations using peptides such as GHK, copper, C60, and cyan AKE were far superior topical solutions.

All right, folks, let's get to those user questions right now.
Here's the first one. With all the problems we are facing, given the fact that the USA is far ahead of other countries in AI with companies like NVIDIA,
OpenAI, and Microsoft, is it possible that we'll grow out of these problems by reducing the impact of debt and deficits by increasing GDP if we can rapidly increase our productivity?
I'm going to let you guys raise your hand for whoever wants to ask these questions. I'm not going to go all around.
Michael, you were first. We'll do Michael, then Bob.
No, in a very simple answer, purely because I think AI has a lot of potential.
We don't fully understand everything it can do yet. It keeps changing.
But one thing we can agree is if you look at the optimistic case, you don't need a lot of labor.
So is that productive? Yeah, but it also means mass unemployment, potentially, and I don't see how that's good for growth,
particularly given the government will immediately step in with welfare benefits for everyone who's lost their job rather than saying,
you know, go hunt for food. So I would like to be optimistic. I'm not. But maybe others disagree.
So I am optimistic, certainly in the medium run.
I think just in general, I'm making an obvious point, I know you know this, Michael, but we get more tools and equipment that makes labor more productive.
That doesn't throw the workers out of work. It just may have to go to other niches.
Having said that, and even if they froze and again, we're at Infineo.ai, we work on AI at my company.
But even if they froze in chat, GPT-4 is the latest that will allow for productivity increases.
But adoption is surprisingly slow, like as with everything that, you know, once, oh, I see something.
And why doesn't everyone else get this? Well, because people are coming from different frameworks and it takes a while.
So I do think medium term it's going to help. But in terms of like the resolution for tonight's debate,
I toyed with this and I don't think that's going to move the needle much in the next five years, even though further than that, I think it actually will be a real big deal.
All right, great. Jim?
Yeah, I would distinguish between the hardware producers and the actual people who write the algorithms for AI.
So, yeah, Nvidia, AMD, Intel, they're all going to do fine one way or the other.
But getting back to the content of AI and GPT in particular, the people who are providing it, the people who are creating the apps, who are they?
It's Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Facebook, now Metta, et cetera.
The same people who lied to us for the last four years about mess, which don't work, vaccines, which are not vaccines.
The war in Ukraine, which we're losing badly. The election in 2020. They lied to us about everything.
They're the curators of AI output. Why on earth should we trust them?
In other words, does it work from an algorithmic and computing point of view?
Yeah, but how could you rely on the output from the same people who lied to you for the last four years?
Interesting question. Just to the point of the user's question here,
do you have confidence that AI could help us get our GDP to debt ratio under better control because productivity is so explosive due to AI?
No. It is powerful. It's not going away.
GPT is kind of a speed reading plagiarist, but I guess there's a place for those.
I wouldn't understate the power of it, but I question and I've spoken to a lot of experts.
In fact, I just wrote a book on it. The guardrails, the governance, the quality of the output.
There's this sense that, hey, you look at the training sets. It's basically the internet.
You can buy the internet a couple of billion pages or whatever.
But the training sets are biased because we had 5,000 years of civilization with bad things happening.
So the bias is there, but this crowd who are unaware of their own biases are out to scrub the bias.
But I say, look, let the good come out with the bad and rely on education and discernment of the reader to decide what's good and bad.
But if you're going to pre-produce that and eliminate so-called bias, the bias keeps us alive.
It's how we survive this long. But if you're going to try to scrub the bias and substitute your own bias.
And by the way, what's in the new training set? Men can compete with women in sports pretending they're women.
That's what's in the training set now. They don't want to scrub that because somehow that's OK.
So technology is fabulous. It's going to be around. But I really question the usefulness of it given the quality of the output.
Garbage in, garbage out. Got it. All right.
Well, it's a little more than that. It's not even garbage in. They're actually trying to scrub the garbage.
OK. We've got another question here. Back in 1933, FDR enacted Executive Order 6102, which confiscated gold and effectively devalued the dollar by 60 percent versus gold.
Under what conditions do you see similar draconian confiscations slash capital controls returning to the U.S. in which assets would be in peril?
Who wants to handle that one? Jim. He did not confiscate it. That's a misunderstanding. What he did.
The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits confiscation by the public and by the government of private property without proper compensation.
That's unconstitutional. What FDR actually did, it was one of the greatest insider trades of all time.
He took, he required you to deliver the gold. That's what the executive order says. Take it to a Treasury substation or post office or other recipient.
And they gave you money. They gave you $20.67 an ounce. However, it was fiat currency that you couldn't turn around and buy more gold with.
But they didn't confiscate it. They gave you the money. But then once Roosevelt got the gold, he raised the price to $35 an ounce.
The profit was kept by the Treasury. And that was the beginning of the exchange stabilization fund, which is a slush fund, which Rubin used to bail out Mexico in 1994.
Still around, by the way. They actually used it a little bit to prop up Silicon Valley Bank.
So I don't see confiscation today because, first of all, it's unconstitutional. It is a violation of the Fifth Amendment.
And more to the point, you're not on a gold standard. Back then, it was a locked in price. So Roosevelt could take the gold at that price.
Today, it's a market price. You would see it coming. And the price of gold would soar in anticipation of the government having to pay you that money.
So I don't see confiscation in the legal sense because it is unconstitutional.
And gold holders will do quite well, even if the government required it, because, as I say, you would see it coming and the price would soar.
OK. Anyone else have anything they want to pile on with it?
I would just say I think it's highly unlikely they do it, perhaps in some kind of a last ditch effort in order to restore confidence in the currency.
They would potentially do it. But they've spent 50 years trying to get gold out of the monetary system.
For them to all of a sudden put it back in, I think, would do all that work. And so I think it's pretty unlikely.
All right. I'm probably going to regret asking this question.
Michael, go ahead.
One little point, an adjunct to that, looking at it differently, because I spoke about capital controls.
I don't think this will happen, but purely logically, if we're going to go down the route ahead of a president imposing extremely high trade tariffs to try and reduce the U.S. current account deficit,
logically, another way to get there is to put capital controls on money coming into the U.S.
Because if you can't buy treasuries, you're not going to sell to them. You narrow the current account deficit a different way.
So not in any way a forecast, but just a scenario where you could see it.
That's a potential tool in the toolbox that the government might pull out.
All right. My better judgment is telling me not to ask this question, but I ask it anyways.
I'm wincing in his voice.
Yeah, yeah. So you may or may not have seen a video that was widely circulated a month or so ago called The Great Taking.
And full transparency, I haven't watched the whole thing.
But I believe that the premise was sort of that Americans truly don't hold title to the financial assets that they own and that there's legal groundwork laid for the government to be able to at some point in time say, actually, you know what?
We actually own all that stuff. And it would be sort of a confiscation of financial assets.
Bob, you're sort of, I think, looking like you might be familiar with this or not.
I don't want to put you on the spot, but does anybody have any thoughts or reaction to The Great Taking?
Yeah, I'm happy to talk about it. So I've watched the documentary. I've read most of the book, not all of it.
I'm very familiar with the concept.
Interestingly, my friend Raoul Pal did a similar analysis eight, nine, ten years ago and kind of came to the same conclusion.
So I've kind of been familiar with this thesis for a while.
And I can't sit here and say that I think I think Webb is his last name that wrote the book.
I can't sit here and say that he's 100 percent right, but I'm pretty sure he's not 100 percent wrong.
And so you've seen these types of things happen during different crises, going back to the global financial crisis.
And do you really own the securities or does the bank own them? Are you a liability?
Does the bank owe it to you or are they holding onto your property?
And this is where counterparty comes into play and who is your counterparty and do you trust them?
And I know for a fact that government agencies are looking at the problems that exist in the financial world today.
I mean, that is a fact. They're not totally clueless and they're looking at ways to try to solve it if and when a crisis breaks out.
And the idea that they have never thought of any of this to me is, again, very naive that they have thought of this.
There are smart people looking at this.
And at the end of the day, the governments will do what the governments need to do to retain order, so to speak.
And it won't really matter what I think or you think or anybody else thinks.
And, you know, I'm not saying that they're going to do this, but you can't rule it out.
And so I think it should be something that people at least think about.
As an author, I have no problem with people trying to plug their books, but the whole idea is nonsense.
Anyone thinks it's even a little bit right, there's no familiarity with the Uniform Commercial Code or the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.
You do own your securities. The fact that it's multi-tiered, that there are basically it's book entry.
Depository Trust Corporation has title, but then they hold it for the benefit of the brokers.
The brokers hold it for your benefit. You get your account statement. You own it.
If they want to take it, you're crashing into the Fifth Amendment again unless you want to declare martial law.
So it's the whole idea is nonsense. But yeah, we'll sell books.
The reason I was chuckling because I'm like in your boat where I watched half of the video someone sent me and then I moved on to other things.
So, yeah, I don't have the legal background to say in terms of, oh, is that would that stand up in court?
I'm not answering this particular, but a related issue. My co-author back when the Dodd-Frank Act came out, Carl Starr,
he went through and he thought, among other things, they were really developing the ability to do bail-ins.
They sort of did a little bit of that in Cyprus.
So his thesis, and I joked at the time that the people voting on that legislation didn't actually read the whole thing,
but he apparently did. And so I do think they do have mechanisms in place that, hey, if a crisis breaks out,
we can do X, Y, Z in order to whatever it may be. Oh, there's certain derivative contracts you thought you had put options?
Well, no, you don't because that would lead to contagion. So no, you don't.
So I think there's lots of stuff they do have in place in this particular documentary.
Again, I'm not an expert, so I can't endorse all the claims there.
But I do think that they have people writing memos and providing briefs to be ready to unveil stuff in various scenarios.
Just like we know how to invade Canada if push comes to shove. They're ready for it.
Well, that we definitely have.
Next question. In 2014, Barack Obama's top economic advisor, Jared Bernstein, wrote a New York Times op-ed saying,
"The U.S. should dethrone King Dollar," and concluded that,
"Privilege of having the world's reserve currency is one America can no longer afford,"
as a strong dollar is costing America millions of high-wage manufacturing jobs.
Do you think it is in the U.S.'s best interest to keep the dollar as the world's reserve currency?
I'll start with you, Michael.
I'll jump in on this one. We're all going to have a view on it.
I think you can make a really strong case that, logically, he was right.
That you may think, because I'm arguing the position, I'm arguing here tonight,
that I think the current global structure is great and enviable and wonderful.
I don't. Not in the slightest. I just think it's very hard to shake it off its foundations.
But the one thing that would do it is if enough vested interests in the U.S. realize,
actually, we're better off. I mean, this was discussed years ago, as you know, Jim and Robert.
The tripping paradox emerged decades ago.
Everyone understands what the underlying problems are
and what the cost of being the global reserve currency is,
and that editorial was not completely wrong.
You can try and dress it up another way if you love free trade, and people do, but they're wrong.
It is a serious issue.
And I think when you look at the election of Trump in 2016,
and the fact that Biden, when he came in, didn't roll back the tariffs
and actually expanded them and widened them to some extent,
and now you've got Trump talking about a 60% tariff on China and a 10% universal tariff,
and he can impose them, as we know, by executive orders.
It hasn't even got to go through Congress.
We can see the direction of travel.
The question is, does the U.S. have the mindset to understand what the real problem is
and what the real consequences are?
But even if that were to happen, even if it were to happen,
I still don't think it would stop the rest of the world thinking,
"My goodness me, it's harder to export to the U.S. than it ever was.
I need dollars even more because I've still got to serve this 50 trillion of debt,
and it's going to be really hard to get it."
And so the only person I think who's going to topple the dollar from global reserve is the U.S.,
and it's already trying to do it itself,
but it's not going to ever stop the rest of the world thinking, "That was a good thing."
It's going to be like the guy who doesn't realize the girl has dumped him
and is constantly just knocking on the door and saying,
"Take me back, take me back, take me back."
She'll still have her power over him, even if they're no longer in a relationship.
I agree with that.
I've said many times, the rest of the world cannot destroy the U.S. dollar,
but the U.S. can do it themselves.
The BRICS currency we talked about, we don't have to get back into that,
would emerge as an alternative in a world where we're pretty busy destroying the U.S. dollar.
I favor the role of the dollar as leaving reserve currency.
I favor steps.
I think the U.S. should buy gold to bolster that case,
even though we're not on the full gold standard.
In fairness, Triffin's dilemma was right, but that was a world of the gold standard.
That was really his point.
He said you have to run deficits, so the rest of the world has enough dollars to buy our stuff,
but if you run deficits long enough, you'll go broke or off the gold standard,
and that's exactly what happened.
But yeah, I would support a very strong dollar,
a very solid role for the dollar as a global reserve currency,
keep the euro/dollar system going. One of the ways I would do that,
I wouldn't buy treasury notes on the Fed, I'd buy gold, but that's a separate issue.
But we're doing everything possible to destroy the dollar,
so my forecast is not my wish.
My wish is that we do have a very strong dollar as the leading global reserve currency,
but we seem to be doing the opposite.
All right, Bob.
I think I have the mirror image of yours that I'm predicting the U.S. is going to forfeit it,
but that would be a bad thing.
Kind of ironic.
In terms of Jared Bernstein's quote, assuming that was the accurate--
I don't know off the top of my head if that was a little word to you,
but I would dispute the premise that, oh, to have good manufacturing jobs,
you need to have a weak currency that I think you just get into a beggar of that neighbor policy.
Each country keeps devaluing against the other, and that's not going to bolster your manufacturing sector.
So that particular element of the thesis I don't think follows, that wages would adjust price levels,
and if it made sense for you to have a strong manufacturing, you could.
Ultimately, the foreigners who are sending you net exports could be acquiring equity in your companies
that are employing all your high-wage manufacturing workers.
In terms of the accounting, how could that work?
That's one idea.
All right, and Brent is the dollar milkshake guy.
You can't get off the hook on this one, so you've got to have an opinion.
Listen, I don't think the U.S. is doing everything in its power to destroy the dollar.
If they wanted to destroy the dollar, it's very easy.
You have to devalue it overnight.
So this idea that they're purposely trying to destroy it or even accidentally trying to destroy it,
I think is completely wrong.
I think before all is said and done, the dollar will find its all-time high before it finds its all-time low.
And I think also the people--
I think that article that was written, I think from an economic standpoint, again, I think it tends to be correct.
And if you're just strictly looking at it from an economic standpoint, I think you can make that argument.
But I think to make that argument is to misunderstand power
and the importance of power and the role of power in the world.
And the global reserve currency is the most powerful weapon in the world,
and it is the most dominant thing in the world from an economic standpoint, from a military standpoint,
because it's kind of the one ring.
It's the one ring that rules them all, and that is an addiction.
Everybody wants to think that they're Frodo, and they'll throw it into the fire, but once you have it--
He didn't. He got his finger bitten off.
That's right. And so it's very easy to say we're just going to give away the world reserve currency.
It no longer suits our purpose. It's hurt our jobs.
And that's not the way politicians think. Politicians think in terms of power.
And I will die on the hill that says the United States will not willingly give away the global reserve currency.
Okay. All right. Next question.
I've not heard any discussion about the reverse repo draining coming to an end shortly
and how that has funded $1.8 trillion in short-term government debt since last July.
It's now come from $2.3 trillion down to about $500 billion right now.
In Q2 2024, the Treasury will return to long-term debt issuance to the tune of around $400 billion.
Will increased long-term debt issuance be met by enough demand to absorb the issuance
or will yields need to rise dramatically?
Do short-term interest rates really even matter?
Aren't long-term interest rates what matters since both equities and housing are based on long-term rates?
A lot of questions back to Matt.
It's a vampire question. Well, taking one at a time.
When they say reverse repo, I assume they're talking about the Fed program
where they'll take cash and pay you interest and then give you Treasury securities.
And that would be a reverse repo from the dealers perspective. Is that what they're talking about?
I think they're talking about just the draining of the reverse repo program, which has been happening all year.
Well, that's the Fed program. Yeah.
It's completely irrelevant because for two reasons.
One, the cash just goes into excess reserves and who cares.
But the securities cannot be rehypothecated.
That's why you're in this strange world where at an auction dealers will bid aggressively
and they'll take a lower yield maturity on a Treasury bill than you can get by calling up the Fed.
So why would you bid aggressively for a lower yield than the Fed will give you for a phone call?
The answer is because when you get that security, you can rehypothecate it.
So there's a collateral shortage in the world to go along with the dollar shortage.
And that's why there's so much demand.
The Fed program doesn't solve that because those Treasury bills cannot be rehypothecated.
And these repo chains go on from 10, 20 banks or however many you like.
So that's kind of irrelevant. I forgot the other nine parts of the question.
I'll take the other parts of the question.
I think the other parts of the question is will they be able to sell the Treasuries?
Will enough buyers show up or will interest rates have to arise to attract more buyers?
And the short answer is we're not going to have a failed Treasury auction.
The banks will take it down.
And if that starts to come into question, they'll mandate that pension funds and hedge funds
and IRAs and everything take it down.
So we're not going to have a failed Treasury auction.
But could interest rates rise? Yeah, interest rates could absolutely rise.
And that wouldn't surprise me if that happens at all, especially as issuance picks up, which I expect it to do.
But the thing is these questions are always poised in how is this bad for the United States.
The rate on the 10-year bond rising is a nightmare for the rest of the world.
And that's what needs to be understood because all of a sudden you've got a 10-year yielding 5, 6, 7 percent
or whatever the number is, and that's in line with what emerging market bonds yield.
Now, are you going to buy a bond from the Philippines if it yields the same as from the U.S. Treasury?
No, you're going to buy a Treasury.
And that liquidity that goes into Treasuries, because they're now competitive with emerging markets
or other country yields, that denies the rest of the world of the much-needed dollar liquidity that they need.
And if there was another option, which even our colleagues on the other side of the table admit,
right now there is no other option. They're trying to come up with one.
If there was another option right now, they could go to it, but there's not one.
And so you still need dollars to operate on the global stage.
So a rising interest rate on the 10-year makes the dollar turbocharged.
It puts the rest of the world under pressure because they owe $50 trillion in U.S. dollars that they don't have
and they can't print. And it drains any new liquidity that is issued back into the U.S. Treasury
because it's now yielding a higher rate.
So I appreciate the question, and it's a very good question, and it's an important question.
And I think they've identified a very important factor.
I just think the way it's couched as is this a bad deal for the United States is to miss the understanding of how the system actually works.
Got it. Meaning if it's a bad deal for the U.S., it's a much worse deal for everybody else.
Absolutely.
All right, next question.
Vladimir Putin recently said, and Elon Musk agreed, that the weaponization of the dollar in the Cold War against Russia,
which was also kicked out of SWIFT, was a dumb move.
I think we might have already addressed this a little bit.
Do you agree? And what message did this send to the rest of the world?
I think we actually kind of mostly addressed this.
We all agreed. Putin was right as usual.
Putin was right as usual. Okay.
You guys are on record as usual.
I'll leave it there. I'm waiting for the next question to come up here.
Can I make one point on that?
Please, thank you.
I think, and I didn't listen to the whole interview, but if I remember right, he said,
"Do you understand what you're doing? Do you understand how this is going to be horrible for the U.S. dollar?
And in the fullness of time, this will be a disaster, the dumbest move in history," or something to that effect.
And I would argue, and it's not that he's wrong, but again, there's another side of it,
and I would argue that the dumbest move in history is when the rest of the world decided to use the euro dollar
as their currency that they would use amongst themselves because they built the prison that they are now in.
That they're now trapped in.
And the idea that you're going to borrow that much money and use the U.S. dollar that you can't print
and you use it amongst each other and you owe it to each other, that's the prison.
And that's what makes de-dollarization so hard.
Again, de-dollarization is de-leveraging.
And I've yet to see a politician who is willing to de-leverage and accept the pain that goes along with it.
Except sometimes you have no choice.
You get into four cells, you're de-leveraging whether you like it or not.
And in de-dollarization, when you do that, the dollar goes higher.
That's what a credit contraction is.
A credit contraction is a loss of money, the supply of money contracts,
and when supply goes down, when demand stays solid, price rises.
All right, gents, we're coming up to what is going to be the last question of the evening.
Again, thanks to all our viewers, thanks to our panelists here.
Folks, right before I read this question, too, on the proposal of the panel
as to whether the U.S. dollar was going to lose its dominant world reserve currency status by 2030.
And remember, that's not that it's not going to be a world reserve currency,
it's just not going to be the dominant one anymore.
It would be wonderful to see in the comment section below this video
what your personal conclusion is after having listened to today's experts.
But here we go with the last question here.
Singapore, with its utter lack of natural resources,
and Michael, this is right up here, Alan,
must rely on the competence of its people.
It has traditionally pegged its monetary policy to the U.S. dollar,
but given its outsized buy-side position in the central bank gold market,
it likely sees the handwriting on the wall for the U.S. dollar.
Given also that Singapore is the only Asian country with a judicial system based on English common law,
please comment on the merits and weaknesses of the Singapore dollar as a trade reserve currency.
Well, that's a fun little question to end the evening with,
and I'm sure everyone's going to jump in there.
Super specific.
Okay, let me just unpack that just a little bit,
and I can't see all the questions on the screen, so I'm already kind of losing it a little bit.
Well, first of all, Singapore is a very interesting economy.
I agree with the first part of the statement that it's achieved an enormous amount with no real natural resources.
We can all learn a lot from Singapore, the way they handle things.
It breaks the mold in terms of being extremely statist in some ways that you would say,
"I don't like that, but it really works," and extremely free market in others.
There's no homelessness, basically.
Everyone gets a house, everyone can eat cheaply at the hawker centers
with really good, nutritious local food that keeps the local culture alive.
If they've ever visited and eaten there, it's an absolute treat.
So that's not the way things are supposed to work when the government has a heavy-handed role,
but it really works there without corruption and without problems
and without distortion that make life unlivable.
That actually makes life much more livable than it would be
when you compare it with other Southeast Asian countries where the state keeps out
and large private corporations mean that you don't have a home
and there's homelessness everywhere and poverty and you can't get cheap food.
Anyway, in terms of the monetary policy of Singapore,
they don't have an interest rate per se the way that other countries do.
They use the Singapore dollar itself as their monetary policy
in that if they want to try and bring inflation down, given they import nearly everything,
they let the currency appreciate, and the opposite, they let it depreciate
because Singapore runs a vast structural trade surplus
because of the structure of the economy.
Very, very small, but lots of goods go out, lots of money comes in.
So they get to use the currency as a mechanism.
Issues pertinent to that related to potential new national security law there.
Maybe Singapore might be better placed relative between the two.
In some eyes, the Financial Times was implying that.
But I don't see how any of that ties in directly to gold or the U.S. dollar,
but maybe I'm misunderstanding what the question was.
Maybe I'm misinterpreting the question, so forgive me if I'm off base here,
but I think implicit in the question is that they're implying that Singapore is buying gold
because they're worried about the status of the United States dollar.
Oh, no, that's not the case.
Oh, that's the question. No, you're right.
I think that was the implication of the question.
The point I would make is that, and I see this a lot,
China is buying gold, and Saudi Arabia is buying gold, and people in Turkey are buying gold,
and people are buying gold all over the world because they're worried about the status of the United States dollar.
No. People in China are buying gold because the yuan is a horrible fiat currency.
People in Turkey are buying gold because the lira is a horrible fiat currency.
People in Russia buy gold because the ruble is a horrible fiat currency.
Same in Singapore, same in Brazil, same in Chile, same in Canada.
Well, again, it's not that the United States doesn't have problems.
It's not that the U.S. dollar isn't going to lose value versus real thing,
but the idea that somebody in China is saving their yuan to go rush out and buy a gold coin
because they're worried about what a U.S. politician is going to do to the dollar,
it's to miss the point that they are--
The renminbi or the yuan, it's lost 15 to 20 percent of its value since Z came to power,
so you can just go down the line of all the other currencies that have done the same thing.
So the idea that somebody in one of these other countries is more worried about the dollar
than they are about their own currency that affects their daily lives
is, to me, to kind of miss the big picture.
But again, Brent, you managed to change topics in mid-sentence.
The question wasn't about people. Yeah, people in China, India, Singapore--
I said I may have misinterpreted that.
Well, no, it said--
Did you hear that part where I said I may have misinterpreted it?
Yeah, but you went on at length. It was about the government. It wasn't about the people.
So yeah, people in Singapore, China, all over the world, they buy gold or not,
maybe because they want diversification.
Exactly the reasons you mentioned. That question was about the government.
The government runs the currency. They know their currency can't stand up versus the U.S. dollar,
so they need something that holds its value because their fiat currency doesn't.
Exactly. That means they're worried about the dollar. That's the point.
The question was about the government, not the people.
Why are they buying gold? Why are all these countries around the world buying gold?
Because their fiat currencies are horrible.
They need something to back up their own currencies to provide confidence.
No, it's because they're worried about the U.S. dollar, and it said--
Mario Draghi said this. Mario Draghi gave a speech at Harvard five or six years ago,
and before he was head of the ECB, he was governor of the Bank of Italy.
And he said when I was governor of the Bank of Italy, I never sold an ounce of gold.
And he didn't. Italy is a gold power. It's on my list. I'll put it on Twitter.
But Mario Draghi never sold an ounce of gold, and he said because I need a hedge against the U.S. dollar.
And who knows more about-- he was head of the ECB and the Bank of Italy.
What I will say, going back to Singapore just for a second, is that living there,
the government is extremely honest with the people in terms of the volatility of the backdrop.
So when they give an annual speech about what's going on, the state of the nation, if you will,
they're not just trying to constantly say we're going to be a shining Jerusalem on the hill,
or we've never had it better like you hear in America over and over again.
They're like, no, we are heading for serious volatility.
The elephants are getting ready to clash, and the grass might get trodden on,
which is a Southeast Asian phrase.
And you hear that kind of phraseology and terminology being used there.
So I appreciate that, as a resident in Singapore, that you actually have authorities
that are recognizing the volatility of the background, trying to prepare for it.
And they're doing their best to make sure that they're well positioned within that.
Now, whether they are or aren't buying gold, let's forget about that for a moment,
but it's nice to have some decent leadership.
And by the way, the Singapore dollar is doing just fine.
That's not why the Central Bank is buying gold.
I earn it, it is.
The Central Bank has been net buyers of gold for 14 years.
Because their currencies are falling versus the U.S. dollar.
The Singapore dollar is doing just fine.
Fine. It's not going up good since the U.S. dollar.
Look at the chart.
Over a period of time, the Singapore dollar is doing fine.
They're worried about the dollar. They're buying gold. That's smart.
All right, gentlemen. Well, thank you so much.
In getting to the end here, I gave each of you a two-minute opportunity
to have an opening remark each at the beginning.
If I can give you maybe a 20-second closing remark to each of you
of just any thoughts you'd like the audience to leave with, let's do that.
Bob, if we could start with you.
Sure. So my one closing point here is the repeated rhetorical move
from our opponents here has been to say what's the alternative,
what are they going to do, again, as I opened up with.
In terms of reserve status, it went from in 2000 the U.S.
was 71% of global reserves, in 2022 it dropped to 58%.
So it's already dropped 13 percentage points.
So it's not incumbent on us to say what possibly could someone else move into.
It's happening right now, and we're just saying maybe that trend
is going to accelerate to hit the 2030 benchmark to be under 50%.
So that's, again, this is happening.
It's just a question of is it going to speed up or not.
Okay. Jim, we'll round out TMI.
Yes, saying there's no alternative is not a great argument for anything.
In fact, there are two alternatives, the BRICS currency and gold.
Okay. Michael?
I really enjoyed the debate.
I think we actually have a lot more in common than people might think.
I'm just a natural skeptic on all things.
I wish there was something nice and easy that I could hang on to.
I look for it in all aspects of life, and I don't find it very often.
Brent?
Yeah, and I'll just wrap up. The same thing.
I've loved this. Like I said, I owe a lot to each of you.
I've learned a lot from each of you over the years.
Again, in my industry, timing is important,
and I have to deal with the real world.
In the real world, a BRICS currency doesn't exist.
Gold exists. I think everybody should own gold.
And I would just encourage the people that have listened tonight,
we talked about 2030 as the date.
If you had to pick one country to put your money into
between now and 2030 and you couldn't take it out,
one country in the world, which one do you pick?
I know which one I would pick,
and I would encourage you guys to do the analysis to come up with your own conclusion.
All right. Gentlemen, I can't thank you enough.
It's been a wonderful three hours.
It's been exhilarating. It's been educational.

Not you.
Will the US dollar collapse?
Then maybe we'll never replace the dollar. The ruble won't do it.
Really, the dollar is the one that's going to be used.
Cryptocurrency undermining the role of the dollar.
Now there are a couple other groups that may join forces with the bricks.
I think it's bigger than losing any war.
The US dollar is going to strengthen it.
That era is coming to an end.
This mysterious driver tricks cops into thinking he's about to pull over.
Then all hell breaks loose.
