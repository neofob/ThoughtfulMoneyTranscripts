Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. The Federal Reserve is one
of, if not the most significant institutions in the world, given the global impact of its policy
decisions. It influences the price of nearly everything, as well as the availability of jobs,
the stability of our banking system, and the purchasing power of our money. When the Fed chair
speaks, the entire world stops to listen. But the average person has a poor understanding of how
this colossally important entity operates, or even why it exists. And after a series of asset price
bubbles, which some argue were in another one now, a chorus skeptical of the Fed's actions has emerged.
So today, we're doing our best to shine as bright a light as possible on the Fed. How and why it
operates, the good as well as the shortcomings of its actions to date, what directions its policies
are likely to take from here, and how all of this impacts the households of regular people just like
you and me. We've got the great privilege of speaking today with Thomas Honig, former CEO of the
Kansas City Fed, former voting member of the Federal Open Markets Committee, a former director
of the FDIC, and now a distinguished senior fellow at the Mercatus Center. Dr. Honig, thanks so much
for joining us today. Thank you and thanks for having me. I look forward to the conversation.
Thank you. I do too. It's a real privilege. I must say, too, I made the wise or foolish decision to
let my viewers know that you were coming on for this interview, Dr. Honig, and invited them to
submit questions. And I got buried under the edge. I lost count as we got near 200 questions. Folks,
I pulled as many of those as I can to ask Dr. Honig here, please forgive me, I'm not going to get
through even a small fraction of all the questions that were submitted, but I tried to
really pull the most representative ones out. I also must say, Dr. Honig, in the commentary that
folks submitted, there was an awful lot of praise for you. A lot of folks have read the book The
Lords of Easy Money by Christopher Leonard. You play a big role in that book. Folks
really appreciated the role that you played during the great financial crisis in terms of
doing your best to shape Fed policy there. You were a dissenting voice, which we'll talk about
in just a moment. But there were other folks there, too, in the comments that have some
personal connections in one way or other to you. I think one person, their brother had
worked with you and just couldn't say nicer things about you. So I wanted to acknowledge
that. If I can, let me just read one quote that somebody submitted here, too. They said, "Look,
I don't have any questions other than thanking him for trying to do the right thing. Unfortunately,
more often than not, people 'grow a conscience' only after they've left a position of power and
responsibility. He is the exception." So I just want to let you know, you've left a very indelible
mark there in the consciousness of a lot of these people. And I'll be transparent, Dr. Honig,
this is an audience that spends a lot of time focused on macro.
I wouldn't say there are too many Fed lovers in the audience and that might be for good
reasons. It may not be and we'll hopefully clarify here today. The purpose of this conversation is
literally just to try to help people get a better understanding of how the Fed operates and perhaps
your own personal point of view on a number of issues. We're not here just to bash away,
but there are a lot of skeptics out there. But anyways, you seem to be the exception
in their mind. So again, congratulations. So lots and lots of questions. I'll stop rambling
and we'll just jump in. If we can start with a very broad question and do your best just
to give us the elevator pitch on this. We don't have to go super into it, but
at the highest level, why does the Fed exist? What's its purpose?
Well, it has more than one purpose, but the one that we focus on mostly is in the conduct of
monetary policy for the United States and to provide liquidity in a consistent manner for
the United States over time. And very quickly, in the 19th century, where there was not a central
bank of the United States, there was not a Federal Reserve, the country would periodically run into
major liquidity crises. There was not enough money. It would flow to the wrong place. And
the Federal Reserve was established to help mitigate those liquidity crises. And then it
became more and more involved as a creator of money through its so-called open market operations.
That is its ability to buy assets, primarily treasuries or mortgage-backed securities,
by actually creating a liability on itself to the banking industry. That is truly
creating money. And so that's become kind of the central role and a very important role,
as you mentioned, because it is the provider of increases in the money supply in the U.S. economy
to provide liquidity into the economy. And the goal is to provide greater stability.
And that's where some of the disagreements come, as whether they're actually providing more
stability or creating instability. Okay, well, we'll get into that, maybe,
you know, unintentionally creating instability rather than creating stability. Let me ask you
this. So when you said it was created to help prevent liquidity crises that we saw in past
centuries, we've heard the term sort of lender of last resort. So is that initially why it was
created, which was when we get near a crisis, then the Fed can, and nobody is, you know, willing to
lend to each other, the Fed can step in and be that lender of last resort? Was it really sort of
created as an emergency measure? In a sense, yes. It was created because banks make loans. They're
an intermediary. They have short-term liabilities and longer-term assets loans. And so when people
become uncertain or when the economy has an event, you know, it could be a war, it could be a pandemic,
whatever, then people don't want to lend any loan. Banks are unable to lend. People don't want to
leave their deposits with them. They want to have it in their hand. And those times created
panic. You couldn't get your money, you couldn't make payments. And so the Fed was established to
be able to take from the banks and their collateral, that is their loans, put them on
there as a security, and then they would make loans to the banks that would give them the cash
to make payments to these folks who were uncertain and wanted their cash in their hand. And then when
the crisis passed, people would put their money back in the bank and the bank would repay the loan
and life would go on. The difficulty is that that became more and more of a standard operating
procedure. And then the Fed learned how to operate its so-called money desk by actually increasing
the amount of money on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity into the system to allow the economy to
grow and to prosper and to reduce unemployment. And then it became a policy tool, not just for
liquidity crisis but for continuing to grow the economy over time. And that's when it shifted to
a broader role in the US economy. Okay, so it did evolve from initially sort of a break glass and
kind of emergency role to an ongoing management side. If I can say, for example, it was the
discussion about creating the Fed came after a panic in 1907 when one bank had a difficulty and
people became very afraid and wanted to withdraw funds and we had a liquidity crisis across the
country. And the banking industry itself led by at that time Morgan of JP Morgan found ways to
accumulate cash to over time address that crisis. But people said that's no way to act. It was,
that was no way to perform. So we had to create something and they came together and created the
Federal Reserve at that point. And it was, and even creating the Federal Reserve was very
controversial. That's why you have a so-called public sector, which is the Board of Governors
and a more private sector, which is the Federal Reserve banks. And there's 12 of those located
across the country from Boston, New York, all the way to San Francisco, including Kansas City.
Right. Which you ran. Which I ran for a number of years.
All right. So sort of where I was going with this is so that the Fed's role and responsibilities
have expanded over time. And some might sort of call that mission creep. I'm not saying
necessarily that it is, but it raises the question, is all this needed or was this just sort of an
entity that found itself in a position where it could increasingly expand its power structure and
ability to influence? I guess I'd love to hear any thoughts you have on that, but let me let you
give your answer in the context of my next question, which is what is your current assessment?
If that's what the Fed's mandate was when it was created, and then you know how it's evolved since,
what's your assessment of its level of success to date? How well has it delivered upon
the mission and the hopes and the expectations? And maybe you sort of like societal good as your
main metric for has it been successful? That's a very good and difficult question.
Track record has been mixed. It is in some ways and in important ways responsible for the Great
Depression, because during that period when it should have provided more liquidity, it did not
provide more liquidity. And so that caused the recession or the recession to become a depression
during that period. It was mixed in the 70s, for example, when we had the Great Inflation, because
the Fed in its efforts and its desire to provide enough liquidity provided liquidity on a constant
but somewhat inconsistent basis over the decade, and that allowed inflation to go from as low as
one or two percent to 14 percent when the decade of the 70s ended. And it was successful in the
early 2000s after the recession in 1999, because it lowered rates and provided liquidity, but then
it went on too long and it created asset bubbles and housing boom and so forth that finally erupted
in the Great Financial Recession of 2008-2009. And then it again from reacting that created too much
liquidity going into the next decade, which allowed its balance sheet to get out of hand,
distorted the distribution of wealth in the nation. So it has helped provide liquidity
into the markets that has allowed the markets to grow over time, but also it has also created
volatility periodically over those years, which is why I say its track record is mixed. And I think
we have to acknowledge that. And I think the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal
Reserves, has full discretionary authority to conduct monetary policy. So it's its judgment
that dictates whether it increases or decreases the amount of money or liquidity into the system.
And there probably, in my opinion, needs to be some boundaries put around that to where they
can't do it beyond a certain point without making it a political event and having to go to Congress
for permission to stay outside the boundaries, which I think would bring more discipline to the
process. Okay, excellent. You're heading towards territory that I'm looking to ask you some
questions on, which is great. And I do want to put a pin in your point there about spurring
wealth disparity through its policies. It's something I talk a lot about on this channel,
and I'm just giving you a heads up. I'm definitely going to ask you some questions about that in a
little bit. All right, so just getting back to sort of how you currently look at the landscape,
I'm curious to hear what your current assessment of the macro situation that we find ourselves in
right now, in terms of where we are, in terms of economic growth and inflation and interest rates
and all that, with the lens of, given how you evaluate the current macro situations,
are the Fed's current policies the right ones? Well, for the moment, I think that they are the
right ones. They went on with easy monetary policy too long after the pandemic. And that
created the very high inflation rates that have been very harmful, I think, to the US economy.
Now, part of that was supply disruptions, but a big part of it was growing their balance sheet from
less than $4 trillion to $9 trillion in about a year. So we had 9% inflation. So since then,
they've raised rates from literally nearly zero, 25 basis points, to five and a quarter percent.
And that has helped bring the inflation levels down, as well as supply has also been improved,
but so has constricting the excess demand that was created with this very,
very accommodative monetary policy and liquidity creation. So they have done that. And that,
you know, was too late in one sense, but at least they got it done. And we've got inflation back
to at least 3%. It needs to be lower than that, I would say. So right now, they're following,
I think, a pretty good policy. They're in debates. Everyone's talking about the fact that they're
going to lower rates in June. They even themselves talked about lowering cutting rates in the fourth
quarter of last year. That has been, I think, counterproductive. But now they are in a dilemma,
because everyone's now expecting rates to be cut in June. But the conditions are that we're kind
of in an inflationary recycle. Inflation has been up the last two months. We saw recent data coming
out where inflation is up, commodity prices are up, wages are up, services prices are up, housing
is up. So now they have a dilemma. They're going to have to at least stay where they are if they
don't raise rates. And they have indicated they're not going to raise rates. But they at least should
not be cutting rates until inflation is much closer, at least to the 2% target. So I call it
it's their time to walk the tightrope. Do they give in to the pressures of Wall Street and
others to lower rates? Or do they say, no, inflation has to be brought back down and we're
going to see it through? And that's their dilemma. And I hope they stay and see it through to bringing
inflation back down. Because otherwise, inflation will reignite and they will have a bigger problem
two years from now. >> Okay. I have a zinger of a follow-up
question, but I'm going to wedge something in it beforehand, which is, okay, so we have
interest rates up now above 5%. A lot of people, at least that I talked to on this channel
two years ago when this all started, this whole hiking regime started, said, yeah, there's no way
they're ever going to even get above 3%. The economy just can't handle it. We've got so much
debt now. I guess one question is, well, there's so many ways I could take that. But I guess the
key question I want to ask is, do you think that Powell's sort of dovish pivot, at least in terms
of the guidance he's been giving, that in mid-December sort of surprised everybody, we went
from not even talking about rate cuts to, oh yeah, sure, we're probably going to do some next year.
Do you think that that shift in the visible bias towards cutting now is coming from confidence,
where if you listen to his press conferences, Powell says, well, we don't want to wait until
inflation gets down to two because there's all this momentum behind our hiking regime, and then
inflation could get "too low," lower than we want. So we got to start cutting earlier. Do you think
it's due to confidence like that, or is it due to fear that the lag effect of this higher cost
of capital on the economy, the longer we stay up at these high rates, we start getting into
the danger of debt defaults or corporate earnings constriction as companies and households hit the
maturity wall? Well, it's probably a combination, but certainly there was this strong view that
inflation was under control, that it was coming down rapidly, that we've been successful,
and therefore we can think about cutting rates.
Just to include this in your answer, but he's not ignorant of the '70s. As you said,
it ping-ponged around. You don't want to have hubris around this because you saw what happened
last time. Well, exactly, and the second part of it is he is very, I think, legacy conscious. I'm
putting words in his mouth, but I'm saying legacy conscious, that he does not want to be known as
Arthur Burns who allowed inflation to ignite. He wants to be more in the viewed as a Volcker-like
person who took strong actions and brought it down. So that's where his bias was, but he also
does not want to have a renewed recession that would bring a great deal of unhappiness
on Wall Street and perhaps in the markets more generally. He doesn't want to see unemployment
go up, and therefore he's anxious to say, "We won the inflation fight, so now we can
start assuring that the economy doesn't fall into recession because of our tight policies,
and therefore we're cutting." And so he's in that dilemma, and he has to work his way through it,
and so does the FOMC. My view is, and I wrote on this, that the '70s is more likely to repeat
itself if you get too confident too soon. And I even said when they were talking about this
in December, that if you look at the consumer price index, since June, since they stopped raising
rates, it has not fallen really much below 3%, and core has been clearly 3%. So why are they talking
about cutting rates? It wasn't as if they were coming down from three to two and a half. They
were staying around that 3% range, and they should have been more cautious in their words and actions
to where they're not in this position of, well, if they don't raise rate in June, people are really
going to have a market tantrum. So now they're in a tighter spot than they would have otherwise
have been. But it's a tough job, and you make those choices. And the desire to reassure that
we're going to have a soft landing somehow got ahead of itself. So let me ask this. Look,
obviously, I mean, you tell me, but you know better than I, but obviously, I don't think
any Fed chair would ever say, hey, folks, we're going into a recession. We need a recession,
and I think we're going into one. We're trying to, or even worse, we're trying to engineer one,
because then everybody would price that in, and you would instantly get the recession.
But let me ask you this. The Fed and our fiscal and political authorities,
from my vantage point, they just seem to want eternal summer. Like every time there seems to
be a hint that the business cycle wants to actually go into a downturn, which is natural,
we act like it's this abomination and must be suppressed at all costs. Is that true or
am I overstating it unfairly? But it seems that they just don't want the business cycle to happen
anymore. But that is the natural way of things. That's what clears out the malinvestment.
You said he doesn't want to stay too high, too long, and cause a recession, but really,
shouldn't at some point we say, look, that's part of it. Yeah, we need to have a recession. Maybe
let's try to manage it so it's not terrible. But yeah, let's have a clearing out cycle from time
to time. Well, a very good point. But here's the difficulty. Policymakers, whether it's a committee
or a chairman by himself, they are prone to want to have good outcomes. And good outcomes are
defined as low unemployment and low inflation both. But the bias is towards low employment.
And what we had in this country for generations was we were on perhaps an inefficient so-called
gold standard. But the main point of that was it was a rule. You had to be able to redeem
and make good. And that became the discipline. But we gave that up in 1971. And we made the policy
choices now fully discretionary. The committee gets to decide Congress on monetary policy,
Congress on fiscal policy. And the politics of it is we want to make our public happy with us.
And the way to do that is to have full employment and a good economy. And you think about that in
terms of always the short term, always looking towards full employment, which then leads you
to make these mistakes and not allow the markets to clear that if you have too much stimulus,
you'll create inflation. You'll have a need to really tighten down and create a recession.
And part of monetary policy's challenge is the political side of things, fiscal policy.
Because in the pandemic, we increased our spending in one year between 2019 and 2020 50%.
So we moved from $4.5 trillion to about $6 trillion, rounding numbers here, but in one
year. And then we kept it there. So the national debt increased from that period of around $24
trillion over time to now it's $34 trillion. And a big part of that was the Federal Reserve enabling
it because the Federal Reserve bought a good deal of that debt and put it on its balance sheet and
printed the money to do that. So in an effort to make sure that no one suffered from the pandemic,
they engaged in both very strong fiscal stimulus and very strong monetary policy.
But the problem was the worst of the economies was over by the fall of 2020, the fall,
not the winter, not the following year, the fall. And yet the stimulus programs,
infrastructure spending, chip spending, manufacturing,
subsidized chip manufacturing spending, infrastructure spending, and the Federal
Reserve was buying on average $120 billion of debt every month. And so you're putting all this
new printed money into the system. And it, of course, created an asset problem. We saw housing
more than double or double. We saw the stock market boom. We saw all these assets, even
commodities. And then, okay, so we increased interest rates to bring inflation down after it
got to 9%. And we're sitting there saying, well, we'll do it. We'll bring it down. It's coming
down. That's good. So now we don't have to worry about it so much. But the fiscal side is still
spinning. They're borrowing more than ever. And the Federal Reserve has to stay there and say,
am I going to allow this to continue? Well, they're saying no. But right now there's a
lot of excess liquidity still in the marketplace. And so that's what's funding the government debt
and the private sector. But that's going to go away. And that's when the challenge will come
back to the central bank. Are you going to monetize the debt some more? Are you going to
hold firm and force the Congress to pull back spending? And are we going to suffer a recession
at that point? And that will be the hard point for both the Congress and for the Federal Reserve,
that to this date, they've been able to finesse through, but I don't think that's going to last
very long. Okay, so when I mentioned I had a zinger of a follow-up question, this was it,
which was you said that at least at this snapshot moment in time, you think the Fed's policies are
about right for where we are. My follow-up was going to be, well, what about the fiscal policy?
It needs serious work. It needs serious work. We are going to run a trillion-dollar deficit.
We're going to run more than a -- we're going to have a trillion dollars of interest payments
at a $2 trillion deficit. And that's not sustainable over the long period. And by that,
here's what I mean by that, though. It doesn't mean we're going to fall off a cliff. We're
the United States. We have a lot of industrial capacity to keep going. But here's what happens.
When you do that, to fund that debt, two things has to -- you have three possible
buyers of the debt, foreign interest, domestic interest, and the Federal Reserve. And we know
that foreign interests have -- they're kind of pulling back. They have enough U.S. dollars,
trillions of them. The domestic side, they've picked it up. Money markets are now buying -- with
all this excess liquidity, they're buying some of the debt. And they love the short-term rates.
And they love the short-term rates. So what used to be an excess of their money that the
Fed pulled out, which was $2.5 trillion, is now less than a half a trillion. So that's coming down.
And the banking industry has also moderated its own holdings of it, allowing the money markets
to take that. But then that leaves the Fed. And the Fed said, well, I'm not -- we're not going
to buy any more of your government debt for now. And so that means that it has to go more and more
from the private sector, right? They have to lend to the government, the private sector in the U.S.
And over time, as that extra liquidity that was sitting in those money markets goes away,
it's going to have to come from others. And that means private sector borrowers are going to have
to start competing with the government for those funds unless the Federal Reserve starts to print
money. And that's when the challenge comes. And I think we've -- because of all the excess
liquidity that was already there, we've avoided that. That -- the day of reckoning lies ahead.
And so when I say the Fed is doing okay, they're trying to bring inflation down. They have rates up.
But the federal government is still borrowing far more than the private sector over time can fund
for it without causing interest rates to rise and hard times to become more likely in the future.
All right, so how do the monetary and fiscal heads dance together, if at all? So do they
coordinate or is the Fed looking at the Treasury right now and saying, in Congress, and saying,
"Guys, what are you doing? You're making my job a lot harder." Well, whenever Chairman Powell has
asked that question, he says, "Well, we don't do fiscal policy. That's their issue. We have to
watch our monetary policy." And that's a fine answer if what he means by that is we're not going
to monetize the debt. But what he -- I hope he's saying, at least in private, to the Secretary of
the Treasury, to members of Congress, to members of the Senate, "If you guys don't get your act
together and get this debt under control, you're going to put us in a very difficult position,
because we cannot -- we cannot monetize your debt without causing inflation to reignite,
and we are not going to do that. That's not our job." If he's saying that, then more power to him.
I don't know what he's saying. I hope he's saying that. But then the time will come when that has to
be addressed, and he's going to have both political parties yelling at him. He's going to have a lot
of unemployed people yelling at him when they should be yelling at the Congress for bad policies
for over a decade. A decade. So if you're saying this story sort of hinges on Congress's willingness
to change its tune, I don't live in the Beltway. You've been close to that world that I have,
but I have extremely little optimism that they're going to do that proactively, simply because I
don't see anybody with the political desire or courage to get up there and basically promote
austerity. Yeah, and you're right. I don't see it either. Prior to the great financial crisis,
there was an attempt, bipartisan, and Simpson-Bowles was the two senators, bipartisan.
They put a very good plan together, and people at least in the Congress were talking to one another,
both sides of the aisle, and it couldn't pass. So now you have a more strident environment. I don't
see it passing either. So that means we will put the Fed under more pressure. Interest rates will
probably rise, and it's not necessarily go off a cliff. That's a possibility, but here's the other
thing. Even the Congressional Budget Office, looking ahead, is projecting that our national
debt in 10 years will be greater than $50 trillion from where it is today at 34, 35.
And they're also, and it's the most important point, are projecting that our real growth rate,
our real growth rate, which is our real ability to create wealth for the nation, will fall from
an average rate of 2.2 to 2.3% to 1.8%. Now, over that period, that means there's a trillion dollars
of real wealth lost in our economy because of our bad policies, and that's in one decade.
So if you don't correct it between now and then, or you don't correct it at least after then,
then you become a poorer nation over time. And think about it. Think of other nations
in the past who were leading global economic powerhouses. When they engaged in foolish policies
or, shall we say, undisciplined policies, they didn't stay global powerhouses forever. And it
may take 50, 75 years, but it's inevitable. And that's the part when they say it's not
sustainable. It's not next year. It's not two years from now. It may not even five or six or
seven years from now, but over time, we slow our ability to create real wealth and make ourselves
poor and our next generation poor. And it's not just the Congress. I will tell you, I've given
speeches all over the country and they say, "Tom, we have this deficit. We have to address this."
I say, "Yes, you're right. And so we're going to have to deal with our taxes and our spending."
And for example, we have a retirement age of 67, one time 65, 67 for social security. It needs to
be at least 70. And the reaction is, "Oh my gosh, you can't do that." And then I go to the housing
market and they say, "Well, we got this deficit. We have to take care of it." I said, "Yes, we do,
but we have to eliminate some of the subsidies for housing because it's reducing tax revenue."
They say, "Oh, you can't do that to us." Then go to agriculture. So until we have leadership
in this country that says we have a problem, it's going to take shared sacrifice. And if we do that,
we can solve the problem and it can be done. And it can be done by the two parties because when
Clinton was in office and Newt Gingrich was the Speaker of the House, they came up with a
compromise of both spending cuts and tax increases. And no one likes tax increases, certainly not me,
but here's a compromise. And by the end of that decade, we had a surplus
international government. So it's doable, but it takes cooperation and it takes a sense of
sharing of sacrifice. If I'm saying you in housing, you have to pay more or you in this
area of agriculture, you have to pay more and not me, well, then it falls apart.
You lose trust and you lose confidence in the process. And that's very, very costly
to your national wealth over the future. All right. I totally follow and agree with
the logic. And I'm sad because you're validating a lot of my assumptions of how things
do currently work in DC. It's sort of a political nimbyism, certainly when it comes to cuts,
which is like, yes, everybody can agree that that seems like a problem in the future,
but nobody wants to be the one to suffer the cuts for it. I think one of the bigger problems we
have right now, too, is the current cohort of folks in Congress, their whole professional
careers, the pie has continually grown. So what they know how to do is distribute an ever-growing
pie. They don't know how to deal with a shrinking pie where you say no to people and you have to
tighten your belt. So I don't even know right now if they're even thinking about arguing about
potential cuts, because I think their mindset is still, how do we grow the pie? And I do wonder,
and this is one of my questions for you, in the pandemic, it feels like we kind of crossed a line
that we hadn't been willing to cross before by sending direct payments to households.
How big a deal was that? Is that a huge deal? Okay. Because it seems like the next time
things get rocky, the clamoring from both Congress and from the constituents is, hey, yeah, time to
send those checks again. Well, and it's still carrying forward. I mean, the only bipartisan
bill I can talk about today is we have a bipartisan bill that would both continue the child tax credit
and continue keeping taxes low on certain investments and certain business spending.
So the only agreement is, yes, we're going to increase our debt more so we can allow for these
benefits to these two different groups. And so I think that's part of it. Now,
to your point about the pandemic, part of the reason for that is in the great financial crisis,
there was a bailout, but the bailout was to a certain group, the largest banks.
Well, and to the wealthiest, right? Because when you have zero interest rates and asset values go
up, only those who have assets benefit. So you had this period where you actually redistributed
wealth to the wealthy and the resentment among the American people was horrendous and understandably
so. So now we have the pandemic and you can understand why, well, we're not going to do that
again. We're going to make sure everyone gets it. And that's what they did. And, okay, that's fine
if we understand it as a pandemic and it cannot continue, but apparently we haven't understood
that and we're continue to spend very substantially, you know, the increase in spending
that moderated, we increased to 50%, it stayed that level and it continues to stay that level and
increase moderately, but it will increase more aggressively with the interest payments on the
debt. We have national defense to take care of, our entitlements programs, which is two-thirds
of the budget are indexed. So we have all these things to take care of us. So that has to continue
to grow. And that means we have to borrow more and more because we're not going to increase taxes
either, we argue. And I have argued somewhat, shall we say, from my point of view that I think
Republicans and Democrats play off of one another for their own benefit. For example,
Democrats want to spend more and they know they can't get the Republicans to agree to tax
increases to fund the spending. So they spend it anyway, but on the other hand, the Republicans
know that they want to keep taxes low, understandably so, but they won't be able to stop the spending
increases. So they stand in kind of a stalemate that the only thing that happens is the debt goes
up. So we both spend more and we don't increase taxes and our future generations will suffer the
wealth reduction. All right, so you're singing from my song sheet a lot here, Dr. Hunig, about
the diminishment of the prospects for the future of society and for the wealth disparity because
yes, we bailed out the wealthy during the great financial crisis, but we bailed out the wealthy
in the pandemic crisis as well. And really what did we end up -- yes, those checks to households
help, but what was the cost of that? The cost of that was a huge rise in the cost of living.
And now those checks are gone, but the higher cost of living remains. But it goosed asset prices.
So again, the wealthy are doing just great and the bottom 80 plus percent are left with
a worse situation than they had before. So you still have the same outcome in both scenarios.
And I do want to actually, again, dig into that even a little bit more in terms of
how corrosive you feel that is, how concerned that you think you are, because when your populace
basically begins to give up on their future, nothing good comes from that. You're nodding
as I'm saying this. But before we get into that, I do want to ask you this question. So we talked
about the mixed record that the Fed has. You talked about the current fiscal policy, which
you think is on the wrong track, heading the wrong direction. Let's just play for a minute here and
say everybody decides that Dr. Honig should be calling the shots. What reforms would be at the
top of your list? Well, the first thing I would do is, depending on how you want to go about it,
but I would go to the Treasury and I would say, I want analysis of all of our spending,
all the government spending, and I want a group, and they can do it cooperatively with the Congress,
both parties, so we have a full government involved in this, and we start prioritizing,
truly prioritizing, what is most important and whether we're willing to pay for it
out of current dollars, not out of future dollars that we have to borrow today and not out of
printing money that inflates us, and I want the priorities listed, and then I want us to explain
that to the American people, and here's the real important part of that, and that means entitlements
are on the table as well, and subsidies are on the table, and I want you to go through it, and we
have to make systematic cuts, and then I want to know where we can reasonably increase taxes,
because it's going to have to be both sides, otherwise you won't have bipartisan agreement,
but not so much that we destroy the productive capacity of our economy, that is, we discourage
investment, we penalize expansion, so I want that done, and I want it done in a certain period of
time, four months, five months, I mean that means really hard work, and then I want to go on a,
I want to go out to the American people, and I want to explain this, and this is how we're going
to proceed, here's the areas that are going to be cut, here's what we expect, and yes, some people
will suffer, some people will not as much, but it won't be because we favored them, it's because
here's how the cuts work out, but it will be shared sacrifice, and we're going to implement these
systematically, and in the long run, we will be well served by it. Now, explaining long run will
be one of the major challenges, that is, we cannot afford to see our real growth rate fall from 2.3,
2.4, to one and a half percent, because we will all lose, and here's how, so that has to be
explained, and you know, that's an enormous task, I realize that, but it has been done elsewhere,
and it can be done here as well, but it has to be, you know, people willing to talk, not hating one
another, but willing to talk about how we make this work. It's a huge task, but that's the only
way we will solve this problem. The other way we will do it is, if we do encounter an off-the-cliff
crisis, and no one accepts our debt anymore, our foreign sector and the Fed can print it,
and it just inflates us into nothingness, then that will force us to do some hard choices,
but that means it won't be as fair as doing it in a systematic, calm manner that we have time
to do now. Those are our choices, and whether we like it or not, those are our choices, and I hope
the J-PAL and other leaders in Congress and the Treasury are willing to talk and recognize that
as they talk to one another today. Well, I hope you're right. I'm more of a pessimist.
Sadly, I think it's more of just a realist, which is that, you know, you're familiar with the field
of behavioral economics, where just a revolutionary wiring and how we are culturally and all that
stuff. We tend to not have to face something tough until we're forced to, and there's that
famous Winston Churchill quote about Americans, which is, "We'll do the right thing, but only
after we've exhausted every other opportunity." So, sadly, a lot like the guy who doesn't change
his diet until he has the first heart attack. It probably takes some of these issues. I hope you're
right, and Dr. Honig, you've got my vote to be, you know, interim emperor and make all this stuff
happen. I assume in your formula there, the goal would be to be running at a budget surplus again
at some point. Well, I think I would be satisfied, given the depth of the problem, if we could get
our debt growth to fall substantially below our national income growth, our real national income,
our real debt growth growing substantially below, so that we do over time grow out of it without
sacrificing so much of our productivity and our real wealth down the road. So, I don't want it to
be, you know, kind of a hard haul. I don't want it to be so shocking that we go into a major crisis,
but it has to be where we have confidence that we will grow out of it, not in a hundred years,
but in 20, 25 years at max. And I will tell you, in the last time we did this, in the 90s, I think,
I got my dates, it was done more quickly than people thought it would be done.
So, if you really do it, you can be successful. But like you, I'm more of a realist, because we've
actually grown farther apart, and it's more difficult for the parties to talk to one another,
and therefore it's more difficult to get this solution through.
Well, and also sadly, it's just not the playbook, right? We had those aberrant few years you talked
about, but it's really since the early 80s, we have grown our debt far faster than we've grown
our GDP. So, everybody alive who's in the system has been, like that playbook has to be tossed out.
We have to have new people brought in who think differently. I mean, it's a big ask. Like you,
I hope we do it. Right. And unfortunately, how many people tell me, "Well, we've had this deficit
for this long, we haven't had any major crisis from it. Why are you telling us this?" And I keep
saying, "It's not necessarily falling off the cliff, it's a death by a thousand cuts, and suddenly
you bled to death." And that's what I tell them. Think about how, you know, can a household survive
if all they use is their credit card and they think they don't ever have to pay it back?
No. And we can't, governments have a longer period, they have a longer life,
but it holds for them, I think, over time equally as well.
Okay. Dr. Hanig, we are hardly going to make a dent in these questions, which hopefully just
means at some point we can have you back on and continue to go through them at some point in the
future. First off, thank you for giving us your time and giving us such phenomenal answers here.
I am going to keep you for another 10 minutes or so if I can, but I just want to let everybody
know that I'm looking at the tip of the iceberg here with 10 minutes left. Let's see here.
I'm going to ask you, these may not be in any real linear order, but they're just questions
that folks are really interested in. All right. So what's about housing? We're at basically
record unaffordability in the housing market right now. And many see the Fed as being a central
reason for that, for having inflated housing prices by zerp, right? Making it really cheap
to borrow to get into a house initially, by then buying just gobs and gobs of mortgage-backed
securities to support the natural clearing of that marketplace. Any thoughts you have about
the Fed's role in housing and what you see as the future of the housing market here now that it's
kind of locked up with mortgage rates at 7% and now available only to the wealthy that can afford
it and so many folks are priced out now? Well, I think the point is a well-made point. I think
zero interest rates contributed to asset inflation. They kept telling me, "Tom, there's no inflation."
I'm saying inflation comes in different forms and asset inflation is a form of inflation.
And we've made housing much more expensive and we think we're helping out with zero interest rates.
And I'm saying, well, if you can't afford the down payment because the price of the house has gone up
so much, the low interest rate won't make it more affordable. And so you have to get the price of
housing stabilized. And once you get it stabilized, the equilibrium rate of interest isn't zero.
It's just not. I mean, I wish it were, but it's not. It creates distortions in the market. It
creates inflation that we see in housing. So we have to have interest rates that are going to be
much higher than 25 basis points. And in the '50s and '60s, even those periods of low inflation,
the normal, what I'll call the market rate of interest was probably in the 6% range.
And so if we go back to 25 or 50 basis points or 200 basis points on a loan for a house of 30 years,
we are going to see housing prices shoot up again and become less affordable over time.
So I totally agree that we need to stabilize that market going forward or else we will have a very
maldistribution of wealth as fewer people can really afford it unless the government pays for
it and then the debt goes up and we have inflation that way as well. So there's no simple,
no easy answer to that problem in the future. Okay. So I listened to your answers here, Dr.
Hunig, and they're just imminently reasonable. I feel like you see the world very somewhat of the
way that I do, very somewhat of the way that most of the viewers of this channel do.
And maybe this is a slightly uncomfortable question for you to answer it. I'm not asking
you for you to name names or anything, but you are a dissenting voice in your time on the FOMC.
So what is it about everybody else around that table that is making decisions that aren't as
common sense as reasonable as you're saying here? Are they the out of touch academics that some of
them point them to? Is it just the evils of groupthink that you get a lot of people around
a table and they get stupider than they are individually? Or are there political pressures
even though folks say the Fed isn't political? Like why don't they just think rationally the way
that you seem to? Well, I don't have a really good answer for that. I would say part of it is
where money is involved, politics is involved. And there is a lot of pressure on the Fed to
think short-term as well, although they're supposed to be independent so they can think
long-term, but there's a lot of pressure to think short-term.
Sorry, pressure from whom? Is it the administration calling them?
From Congress, from labor, who misunderstand I think some of those issues. From Wall Street,
for sure, they're very short-term thinkers in many ways. So those are part of it. Part of it
is experience. They're academics, you have this theory and you work with it and so forth.
One of the reasons that I descended was experience. I was around in the crisis of the '70s and '80s.
Yeah, you were involved in cleaning it up, right?
I was very much involved. It was a mess. And part of it was I saw what this ever,
you know, we have to stimulate. Yes, inflation is rising, but we can't have unemployment.
We'll take care of it later. That came through until we had this crisis. And in this country,
in the '80s, over 1,600 commercial banks failed. It was disastrous for communities.
And so I'm saying short-term has a price. And I witnessed the price. So when we came back
to when I was descending, I said, "There's a price for this. You're pushing the
rates to zero. That's not a sustainable rate. We should all know that. And we've had it since
2008. We're entering 2010. And you want to increase zero even more." I said, "That's only
going to turn out poorly." And in fact, the following decade, our productivity levels were
half of what they were in the '90s. Wages didn't increase. Real wages didn't increase at all.
And so I said, you know, "Learn from experience." You know, wisdom is partly your education, yes,
but partly is experience. And don't ignore your experience. And so I've seen it now twice going
on three times. We have to begin to think a little bit more long-term, both at the FOMC table and in
the Congress of the United States. Is the short-termism more because of hubris and like,
"Well, we just got to do something now"? Or is it more sort of, "Hey, this will solve the problem
now, and by the time the chickens come home to roost, I'm not here anymore"? That's somebody
else's problem. Again, some of both. And here's the most common theme I heard at the FOMC table.
We have to do something now. We can and we will take care of it later. This hope above reality.
In the Congress, I think it's more of short-term thinking, "I got to get reelected. I want to make
people happy." On Wall Street is, "I want to be rich now, and I'll let someone else pay for it
later." So all those motives come in and put pressure. But my issue with the Federal Reserve
is it was supposedly made independent to think long-term, and it's allowed itself to be captured
by the short-term. And an old central banker, when I was first named president, said, "Tom,
your job as a central banker is to take care of the long run so the short run can take care of
itself." And that's what we have to remember. If only more folks there thought like you like that.
All right, let's see. Let me ask you this. What do you see as the long-term outlook for the
purchasing power of the dollar and other fiat currencies for that matter? You talked about
removing the dollar from the gold standard, remove the last discipline, the break on the system.
So obviously, since then, all that's happened is the purchasing power of the dollar has declined
even faster, and the dollar is doing better than most other fiat currencies. So are we just
staring at the end game here, and it's just going to continue to play out like this? Or is there
potential for something else? Well, unless we change our ways, we will continue to
value the dollar and its purchasing power. And I tell people, yes, that they say, well,
on the international level, the dollar is strong. And I say, yes, if you're grading on the curve,
which we are with currencies, because they're all fiat currencies, you're grading on the curve,
yes, we're still getting good grades in terms of the relative value. But if you
grade on the absolutes, we're getting an F, because the value-- when you look at the consumer
price index, it's really striking. Decades of stable prices until after World War II,
until after 1970, '71, when we went off the gold standard. And I tell people, you have to be
careful, because it had its cost to it. But since then, the price index has gone up exponentially.
Not gradually, but it has just taken off. And I don't see how that future changes unless we
get control of both our fiscal and monetary policies and our country's, shall we say,
love for very low interest rates forever. And unless you get that behind us, and we think long
term, the value of the purchasing value of the dollar would decline. And that explains, in part,
why cryptocurrencies have had their rise in the world, because people perceive that at least
there's some kind of governance on those mining machines behind it, where it can't just explode.
Whether that lasts forever, who knows. But that's one reason I think they have had their prominence.
All right. So I'm just going to let folks know, I've got tons of questions about
your thoughts on Bitcoin, your thoughts on gold, your thoughts on moving to a digital dollar,
your thoughts on central bank digital currencies, your thoughts on a competing currency from a
BRICS standpoint. Will the dollar ever be backed by something? I think we're going to have to just
leave all those for hopefully the next time you're on this channel, because it's unfair to ask you to
address those in just a minute or two. I am going to ask you two unfair questions to address in just
a minute or two that we could probably have a whole hour discussion on each. The first is just
any sort of parting comments you want to have about this growing wealth disparity. This has
been an issue for a long time and Fed policy I think has played a role in it, I'm going to say
for decades. I think it got ramped up even more given what happened during COVID and the response
we had there. We talked about why earlier. But there are some people who look at the Fed's
policies and say, "Hey, these are contributing to wealth inequality here," and they're frustrated by
that. There are other people who look at the policies and say, "Hey, that's the plan," and this
is more sort of the mustache twirling. There's an Illuminati that's driving the world and whatever.
I don't necessarily ascribe to that, but I don't know. If you think differently, let me know.
But it might be a little bit of what you've said, which is the parties that are putting them under
pressure or obviously putting them under pressure to serve those parties' interests.
If that's what's sort of driving policy decision-making, then maybe it's not someone
at the FOMC table saying, "How do we screw the little guy?" But the outcome is still the same.
How concerned are you about the trajectory that we're on, where the middle class seems to be
getting hollowed out? Each successive living generation now is more depressed and less off
than the one that's preceded it. As I said earlier, nothing good comes from your public
basically giving up on their ability to improve their station. In fact, that's what's made America
so competitive in the past. So let me give you the floor on this.
Well, here's what I think. I don't think there's a conspiracy theory
as such. I do think that we've become so short-term in our thinking that we tend to want to
please everyone. When you please everyone, you get really bad outcomes. Here's my last point on that.
Whether you're an athlete or you're a scholar or whether you're a country,
you win by being strong and exercising self-discipline.
An athlete, no matter how much talent he or she has, will only be great with self-discipline
and paying attention to improving. This country, we weren't perfect, but we had rules.
We had a rule of law. We had a gold standard. I'm not saying a gold standard, but I'm saying a rule,
which we don't have right now, that binds our hands. If we have those and we abide by them,
then we have a much better chance of remaining strong and, over time, addressing some of the
wealth issues that we have because it'll allow entrepreneurship to go forward. It'll allow people
to have hope that they can, in fact, improve their own future. Not 100% by any means,
but much better than where we're going with our current policies. Our current policies are
short-term driven and subject to who's putting pressure on. Remember, the people in authority
have pressures coming from people who have a lot of wealth, the lobbyists and so forth.
That's kind of our future. Unless the leadership says we're going to exercise self-discipline
and we're going to have shared sacrifice, our wealth will slowly atrophy and become less.
Okay. All right. Last question, and I'm doing this just because I promised her I'd ask
Stephanie Pomboy, who is an analyst that comes in this program a lot,
just was very curious to hear when you think the Fed is going to return to QE.
Is it just a matter of time that you mentioned that if Congress doesn't do a U-turn pretty
quickly, pretty soon we're going to get into a pinch where there's going to be a ton of pressure
on the Fed. Do you expect them to, at that point, finally let themselves get talked back into QE?
I don't know that that will trigger it, but I do know one thing that would probably trigger it,
a banking crisis. If you had a major banking crisis, for example,
on the bank's balance sheets today, there's over $600 billion of unrealized losses from
just government securities. You also know that there's trillions of dollars probably
of asset values that have declined because of the high interest rates for commercial real estate.
If there was a banking crisis, then the Fed would do QE. In fact, what form it will be,
I can't tell you because when we had the banking crisis last March, 2023, the Fed's balance sheet
actually went back up about $400 billion. If the banking industry gets in trouble and they
have to provide liquidity into it, they will put the money out there and it will be in the
trillions of dollars and we will have in effect QE. The real question then will be how long does
it last? How much inflation does it generate? Will trying to pull back from it create a recession
and they're not willing to accept that so they continue QE well into the future just like they
did after the pandemic? Those are all questions I can't answer, but I do know the circumstances
that will trigger it would be a banking crisis. I lied a couple very lightning round questions.
One is just let's say on a scale of one to five, one being very stable, five being very unstable.
What's your current assessment right now of the stability of the banking system?
About five being unstable. Five being bad. I'd say about a three and a half to four.
Okay. You're worried. I'm worried. I know people say it's very well capitalized. Well,
it's not very well capitalized. I have argued that forever. The banks quote the risk-weighted
capital, which says 14%, but capital of the total assets is around 7% to 8% in the largest banks,
9% to 10% in the regional and community banks. The regional community are better capitalized,
but remember if you have say 4% loss, you've lost half of your capital or more depending on who you
are and people lose confidence in you. That creates the liquidity crisis. So we're very
vulnerable to a confidence crisis in this country should we encounter another banking crisis like
we had in March of 2023. And remember in March of 2023, people started running on all the regional
banks until basically the treasury and the fed said 100% deposit insurance. That's the only way
to stop it. And that's QE. Okay. Again, thank you for that very unfair question to ask you in the
last second here. And I just want to remind folks that you are a former director of the FDIC. So
you're a gentleman who is highly knowledgeable about bank risk. Okay. The last question,
which is you mentioned that there's a date with destiny here as long as the fed maintains its
current policies where the liquidity that's been sloshing around is going to start drying up
and there's going to be increasing pressure on the fed to do something or else dominoes
are going to start dropping and recessions going to start looming. Nobody can say this with
certainty, but what's your general expected timeline for that? Is that something that's
imminent? Is it something by the election? Is it a 2025 issue do you think? I think it's probably,
I don't know. I should always say, I don't know for sure. No one knows the future,
but I'm looking at the amount of liquidity that remains, the half trillion down from two and a
half trillion and the excess reserves in the banking system. So I'm thinking of 2025,
mid 2025 event, if it comes to that. And now in the meantime, if Congress gets its act together
and the fed does other things, we might avoid that. And that's what my hope is. But I think
the reality is there is at least a reasonable probability that 2025 would be a time when the
fed has to make a decision, either print more money and buy this debt or force the private
sector to fund it, which constrained the private sector further and risk a recession sooner,
I should say, recession sooner and inflation later, for sure. Okay. All right. Well, look,
this has been an absolutely wonderful discussion, a real privilege. Thank you, Dr. Hanig. I'm going
to begin to wrap it up here. If I could ask you probably the most important question,
which is for folks that have really enjoyed this interview and listening to you and would like to
follow you and your work from here, where should they go? Well, I do have, I don't publish a lot,
but I do have a blog on sub stack under my name. And it's, if you go to Mercatus Fin Red Rag
on sub stack and look for my name, I do put things out. In fact, I wrote things on walking at the
feds, having to walk a tight rope, the mistakes the fed have made through time that you asked
me earlier today. There's a summary of that on there and a proposal to make it more rules-based.
So that's on my blog. Other kinds of history of the feds, things are on there as well.
All right. So Dr. Hanig, when I edit this, I will put up the link to your sub stack there on the
screen so you know exactly where to go. Folks, there'll be a link in the description below this
video too. So if you just want to go there with one click, you'll be able to do that.
All right. I've got one last question for you, and I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to think
about it, which is we've been talking about money related issues, money creation, all that stuff
through the discussion so far. I'm just curious, you've had a long and accomplished career.
What's one non-money related investment of energy or focus or behavior you would encourage folks to
adopt into their lives? As you think about that, I'm just going to do a couple of quick housekeeping
things here just for a few seconds. First off, folks, if you've enjoyed this discussion with
Dr. Hanig and would like to see him come back on the channel at some point in the future,
please let him know that by clicking the like button and then hitting the subscribe button
below, as well as that little bell icon right next to him, in addition to Dr. Hanig's substack,
if you're not already following my substack, please go do that at adamtagert.substack.com.
That's where you get my write-ups. I call them Adam's notes. They're my cliff notes summaries
of these key interviews. So to get the one from this discussion with Dr. Hanig, you'll get that
there on the substack as well. And then last, trying to navigate the repercussions of
everything we're talking about as you hear me say every week on this channel, folks, is very
difficult for the average investor, especially the average person who's got a job to focus on,
a family to focus on, etc. Highly recommend that you work under the guidance of a good
professional financial advisor to help be your financial quarterback through that to help put
together a customized portfolio and financial plan for you and then help you execute it. But make
sure that they can take into account all of the issues that Dr. Hanig and I have talked about here
and that all the other experts talk about with me on this channel every week. If you've got a
good one who's doing that for you, great. Stick with them. They're rare. If you don't, you're like
a second opinion from one who does, feel free to schedule a free consultation with one of the
financial advisors that Thoughtful Money endorses. To do that, just go to thoughtfulmoney.com,
fill out the short form there, only takes you a couple seconds. These consultations are totally
free. There's no commitment to work with these guys. It's just a free public service that they
offer to help as many people as possible, positioned as prudently as possible,
for the potential implications of all the issues that Dr. Hanig and I have just talked about here.
All right, Dr. Hanig, thanks so much for waiting. Let's get to your last question here. What's one
non-money related investment you would encourage folks to consider?
Well, I would highly recommend they invest in time in reading history and biographies.
My family is very important, but outside of that, I have really learned about leadership
and what works, what doesn't work by reading biographies and history. Yes, I'm an economist,
but my real joy is in reading those things, because that's where you learn so much.
And where you can't experience all the experiences personally, you kind of see it through others'
eyes of people you admire. And there are a lot of good people to read about in biographies,
not just bad guys. Well, and only if your contemporaries did more of that, it sounds like,
that might address a lot of the short-term realism that's going on right now, where people would have
a sense of what history tells us. Absolutely. And it's invaluable. And for all of us, I mean,
for all of us, it's invaluable. Well, Dr. Hanig, I want to just say again, thank you so much for
coming on the program. More importantly, thank you for your contributions in a critically important
role during a critically important time. And again, I wish more people had listened to you,
and I wish more people currently running these institutions think like you, but thank you so
much for the example that you've been setting. Thank you for having me on. I've enjoyed it very
much. Thank you for the conversation. And I hope your listeners have enjoyed it as well.
I can guarantee you they have. Thanks so much, Dr. Hanig. Everybody else,
thanks so much for watching.
