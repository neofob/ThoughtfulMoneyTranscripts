Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
The world is watched intently as the world's most influential central bank, the Federal
Reserve, has implemented the most aggressive interest rate height campaign in history on
a percent change over time basis, but that campaign may now be over, and if it is, it
suggests opportunity in the long treasury bond market.
To find out just how much of an opportunity, we sit down today with highly respected economist
and award winning researcher David Rosenberg, founder and president of Rosenberg Research.
David, thanks so much for joining us today.
Great to see you again, Adam.
Hey, always a pleasure and lots to talk about here.
I want to get into those questions about the Fed maybe being done and what that might mean
for treasuries.
Really quickly though, if we could just pick up, since it's been a while since we talked,
with a general question I'd like to ask you at the beginning of these discussions, what's
your current assessment of the global economy and financial markets?
Well, the economy, generally speaking, is fraught with downside risk.
The global GDP growth is slowing down and I think that we are teetering on the brink
of a global recession.
The US is cooling off, I think that by the first quarter, the white to the eyes of the
expansion are going to be shown.
Canada north of the border is already heading in a recession by most indicators, especially
on the income side of the ledger.
We have the UK is stagnant, Germany is heading into negative growth and that's going to be
the caboose for the entire European Union.
And then we go to China, which is experiencing a debt deflation that perhaps isn't unlike
what the US went through with its real estate morass back in 2006, 2007.
So growth is slowing.
I think it's going to tip into recession next year, ironically, right after everybody and
their mother has thrown in the recession call over the course of the past several months.
Of course, if the recession hasn't come yet, then it's never going to come, right?
It does remind me of 2007 when people were saying the exact same thing.
So that's my view.
And as you said at the outset, I retain the constructive stance on the fixed income market,
generally speaking, and very circumspect on what is still an overly inflated and highly
concentrated US stock market.
OK, so you see recession next year.
You're somewhat optimistic on bonds, less so on equities, it sounds like, lots to peel
into there.
Just on the recessionary side for a moment, it sounds like you're saying really kind of
a global recession, right?
I mean, in past periods where the US has stumbled, we've hoped at least that somewhere else in
the world could kind of pick up the torch.
And I think a great example of that was in the global financial crisis.
China really rode to the world's rescue there.
It had very low debt levels and basically went on a debt spree and really helped goose
the global economy back to life.
There doesn't really seem to be a potential white knight candidate this time around, does
there?
Well, there doesn't.
But let's just go back to that period in '08.
The mantra of the day was global decoupling and that the US is going to slip in a recession
and everybody else is going to be just fine without understanding just how intertwined
the global economy is.
There were just lags that were separating what happened in the United States and then
the spillover effect to the rest of the world.
But China went through the ringer back then.
It wasn't because of the US that the oil price went from almost $150 a barrel in the summer
of '08, within a year later, we're down to $30.
That wasn't the US, that was China.
China went into a downturn.
That's what actually caused the meltdown in commodities.
If you remember, beware of the mantra on Wall Street.
Back then, it wasn't just global decoupling, but it was a China-led commodity supercycle.
That went a long way, didn't it, in 2008 and 2009.
This time around, it's actually a lot more synchronized and China, the numbers there
are abysmal on the economic side, their economy, whether you look at consumer, producer prices,
corporate profits, they are contracting.
The United States has been living on the last vestige of the fiscal stimulus, especially
the stimulus checks, which were gargantuan and kept the expansion going through most
of this year.
That has basically run its course.
But the major point is that most recessions are global, it's not usually just localized
to one country.
There's knock-on effects.
In this game of chess, there's different pieces that move at different times, but normally,
you get a global recession, not just one country going into it.
This time around, as you said at the beginning, it wasn't just the fan-raising rates, but
virtually every major central bank went into major overdrive when it came to raising interest
rates dramatically and tightening liquidity.
Right now, there's some countries that are entering into a recession more quickly.
I mentioned Germany having the influence on the rest of the continent, the UK is flat,
they're going negative, Canada is already basically in recession.
The Bank of Canada doesn't want to acknowledge it and it's not ready to cut rates in advance
of the Fed, although it probably should, and then in the first half of next year, we'll
be seeing the signs that, "Well, what do you know that even in America, the business cycle
is not dead."
Okay, and you mentioned this earlier, but coming into 2023, everybody thought a recession
was going to happen, and then it didn't, and then we started hearing the narrative of a
soft landing creep in, and then that switched to a no-landing scenario.
So to your point, oftentimes when the crowd is all on one side of the boat, something
else tends to happen.
Now that the crowd is basically saying, "What recession worries?
It's been long enough, hasn't showed up here, everyone's talking about a no-landing scenario,
I guess we're good," you think that's right around the time where the recession is going
to hit everybody in the face?
Well, look, quite a bit to unpack in the statement that you just made, I get the question all
the time, "Are we going to have a soft landing?"
And it's a bit of a false narrative, and it's a false debate, because it's not whether or
not we're going to have a soft landing.
We always have a soft landing.
The soft landing is the prelude to the recession.
The soft landing is actually part of the business cycle, it's that bridge, it's that transition
phase from the expansion to the economic contraction, 1979, soft landing, 1980, recession, 1989,
soft landing, 1990, recession, 2000 is a soft landing year, 2001 a recession, 2007 is a
soft landing year, where's the recession, where's the recession, where's the recession?
Yeah, wait till 2008.
So all this soft landing is, is part of the business cycle.
It's a prelude to the hard landing is what you're saying.
It's the transition phase.
So that's what we've been in.
So it's not about are we going to have a soft landing or not, we've been living in a soft
landing.
The question is, what comes next?
And after a soft landing, you get the recession.
The soft landing is just the appetizer.
Now, there have only been three times in the context of a Fed tightening cycle, where we
avoided a hard landing recession, an NBER defined recession.
When were they?
In the mid 1960s, in the mid 1980s, and the mid 1990s, when Alan Greenspan developed the
moniker the Maestro.
Now, those three cycles were special in the sense that the Fed stopped tightening once
the yield curve flattened, they didn't continue to tighten into the inverted yield curve.
This Fed, because it was shamed by the fact that it missed the inflation bulbs, one month
of 9% inflation, but they missed it.
They kept on tightening through the inverted yield curve.
And there are lags.
So it's 100% true.
Shame on all of us that were saying the recession was going to come this year, it didn't come
this year.
But you know, I'm under the same pressure, except more pressure from external individuals
and say, clients, I don't have Merrill Lynch management breathing down my neck, as I did
in '07, I was under tremendous pressure to take away my recession call in '07.
Good thing I didn't, right?
Great thing you didn't.
Well, because as I said then, and as I say now, the business cycle has not been repealed.
And there is nothing more powerful than interest rates.
Not fiscal policy, not trade policy, not the currency, interest rates, as Albert Einstein
famously said, are the eighth wonder of the world, and interest rates operate with a lag
because the economy resets to interest rates with a lag, and sometimes other things get
in the way.
So in 2007, what got in the way, what caused the lags to be longer, that cycle was the
last vestiges of the housing bubble, and the ability of the household sector to continue
into the final months of 2007 to continue to tap their home equity.
Remember, the acronym back then was MEW, M-E-W, Mortgage Equity Withdrawal, and cash-out refinancings.
That Energizer Bunny kept on going until it couldn't any longer.
And then the interest rate effect, the lags kicked in.
Hey, that's a great point, sorry to interrupt, but it's so comparable to the checks to households
that we just had over the past couple of years, right?
I mean, that's essentially what the mortgage equity withdrawals were.
Well, that's the point I was trying to make, was that you had, look, here's what happened.
The historical record shows that when confronted with stimulus checks, the beloved American
consumer historically would spend half and save half.
That's why the Biden economics team went big, go big or go home.
They wanted a trillion dollars of stimulus, so you had to go $2 trillion to get a trillion
dollars of economic impact.
Who is to know that in today's narcissistic economy, that we would have not MEU, but YOLO,
you only live once, right?
Anger spending, revenge spending, and I guess this is all the fallout from COVID.
So that every last penny got spent.
You know, where a lot of us went wrong was in the belief that half of the money was going
to get spent and half the money was going to get saved.
All of it got spent.
So the savings rate today sits barely above 3%, whereas historically, before COVID, the
normal savings rate was more like 7%, 8%.
Historically, Americans, you know, out of every after tax dollar that they made, they
would take a dime and put it in the piggy bank.
Today it's $0.03.
Sorry to interrupt, but at the same time, we're seeing a spike in revolving credit in
households too.
So not only are they not saving, but they're putting it on the plastic.
So as the marginal household ran out of those excess savings, they were tapping their credit
card debt at a double digit rate over the past year.
That process is ending because the delinquency rates going up have compelled the banks to
tighten up the screws dramatically in terms of applications for new credit cards or applications
for increased limits.
That source of "stimulus" is over.
But the San Francisco Fed, which I would say on the record, is the Fed district bank that
actually publishes the best research, found that the last chapter of the excess savings
story, which kept the energizer bunny going this time around, ended in September, which
of course had that exclamation mark of a 0.7% increase in retail sales.
But that's in the rearview mirror.
The one thing that we have to respect is Bob Farrell's rule number one, which is about
mean reversion.
Now, levels don't mean revert, but ratios do.
And the savings rate is a mean reverting statistic.
And if a mean reverts to say 7%, 8% pre-COVID norm, how will that be accomplished?
If it's accomplished through an income boom, well, that's a rather benevolent way to mean
revert the savings rate.
I think it's going to happen by households tightening their belts after their freewheeling
spending ways of the past couple of years, which was always unsustainable.
But the savings rate has hit rock bottom.
And I know when I talk about a savings rate to non-economists, people just, they glaze
over.
But it is arguably the most important behavioral aggregate of the national accounts.
And that is why the consumers hung in so well, why the economy is surprised in the face of
rising interest rates this past year, why the recessionistas like myself were, I wouldn't
say wrong, but just early because who was predicting the savings rate would get this
low.
But that's exactly what happened.
Going forward, the question is how sustainable is that going to be?
I think the banks are tightening up their credit scoring dramatically.
And the labor market's cooling off.
The unemployment rate is going up.
And with the lag that is going to cause wage growth to go down.
And households are going to be compelled to bring their spending into better realignment
with their income potential.
And all that leads to a very significant cooling off in consumer spending, which is 70% of GDP.
So I think that, you know, the people that say, well, and everybody threw in the towel
on the recession, it's incredible.
Just as in '07, Adam, in '07, the only two economists left standing, in the fall of '07,
what the recession called, under tremendous pressure, internally and externally, were
me and Dick Berner, who was chief economist at the time at Morgan Stanley.
And everybody threw in the towel, just like they did this time around.
Because of course, of course, if the recession hadn't come, then it's not going to come.
It's like me sitting here in Toronto, saying to people, it didn't snow in December in Toronto,
Canada, therefore, it's winter has been called off.
I mean, just the lags have been longer this time, for reasons that I stipulated, reasons
that we can understand, but what's important is that there are reasons that don't have
a longer fuse from here.
So I think that by even this quarter, next quarter, the effects of the fiscal stimulus
subside, but the rolling impact of the rising interest rate environment that we've been
in, as the economy continues to reset to that environment, is going to have a big negative
impact on GDP growth.
And I don't think that's fully priced into any asset class right now.
So I love that you are emphasizing the lag effect so much here, because I have been banging
that drum month after month after month on this channel, trying to make sure that people
don't dismiss it.
They don't get to that point, well, it hasn't happened yet, so maybe it's not going to happen.
You, David, are the voice of experience.
You've gone through this meat grinder before, where the recession took longer to arrive
than most anybody thought before, but it did.
And it sounds like you were seeing history repeat here again.
Well, on top of that, we don't even know if maybe the recession has already come and we
just don't know it.
Why did the NBER wait till December of 2008 to tell us the recession began in 2007?
Why did it take them 12 months?
It's not as if they're a bunch of dummies at the NBER business cycle dating committee.
And it's typically actually at the very tail end of the recession that they tell us when
the recession began.
And then everybody is so surprised, but you see, they wait for all the data revisions
to come in.
Right.
The data revisions.
Like, for example, we're all focused on real GDP, GDP, GDP, GDP.
Do you know why? Because we measure in America, economic prosperity, not by the income that
we generate, but by our spending, spending, spending, spending.
That's the measure of economic prosperity.
But you see, you don't need income to spend when the credit figures are turned on or when
you have Uncle Sam giving you all this generosity.
You didn't work for that money.
Uncle Sam borrowed it two years ago and just gave it to you to spend.
That's how we measure economic prosperity.
But when you look at GDI, Gross Domestic Income, which gets very little play.
OK.
When GDI comes out, it's not even on Bloomberg, on their Eco page.
GDP, though, we trade around GDP.
So we have real GDP, for example.
You look at it.
It's up well over two percent year over year.
Real GDI is zero, zero.
If you look at real gross domestic income, it's borderline recession.
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no.
But we focus on real GDP.
But you see, historically, and we have never seen a divide this wide in the national accounts.
And over time, GDP and GDI, spending and income will converge.
Well, I'm just saying historically, it's GDP gets revised into line with GDI, not the other
way around.
So for all we know, because all we're talking about is GDP and we will be getting revisions
in the future.
Look at the employment numbers, you know, because people think that there's no recession
because of this glow from non-farm payrolls.
And Jay Powell, the Fed, the markets, bow down to the holy grail of non-farm payrolls.
And when nobody seems to get in the post-COVID environment, is that the response rate from
the businesses in that survey is down to almost 40 percent.
Pre-COVID, 60 percent, 20 percentage point gap.
What veracity do you put in the non-farm payroll report with a 40 percent response rate?
And that's why we talk about revisions.
How do we know what is not going to get revised away?
What's going to get revised away in 2023 with all these economists throwing in the towel
on the recession, on a sample of data that we can't really fully verify?
That's already suspect.
I think there's a big mistake, well, you know, with all deference.
The non-farm payrolls have been revised down sequentially 90 percent of the time this year
by a combined total of more than 300,000.
Practically every month when they release the new number, they revise all the previous
ones.
That's what I'm saying.
And so all I hear about is, oh, well, it was a weaker than expected report in October,
but come on, 150,000?
That's still pretty good.
Yeah.
Except the household survey was negative 328,000, negative 328,000.
And the difference is that the household survey is a different survey, but it's a survey of
individuals who know damn well whether or not they were working at all last month.
And there has not been a household survey.
There's been no job growth in the past four months in the household survey.
Not for nothing, but of the job growth there has been, it's been pretty much all part time,
right?
All part time, not just that, but you actually have negative employment if it weren't for
the fact that you've had more than 200,000 people over the past four months take on more
than one job, which is classic con reciprocal.
That is a sign of household stress.
On top of that, back to non-farm payrolls, because that's the in green belief system.
Non-farm payrolls, half of the employment growth this year from non-farm payrolls has
come from the birth death model, half, like 1.3 million.
Which just for our viewers, that's an imputed number.
I mean, it's almost like an Excel entry point.
It's not based on real data.
It's just a guesstimate.
Well, it's a guesstimate because what they're trying to do is estimate employment over and
beyond their own survey that's being generated by new business creation.
So I think there's big question marks, big question marks.
We have huge diversions right now.
That's why there's so much confusion, Adam.
You know, we have what people would say is a dramatic recovery this year from the October
lows of last year and the S&P 500.
So that you look at the market, the cap weight indexes tell you one thing, the equal weight
index is still down for the year and down 15% from the peak.
There is no recovery in the average stock on the S&P 500 or the median stock.
So big diversions there.
We have big diversions, I said, between GDI and GDP and a gaping divergence between the
household and payroll surveys.
But people, even economists, don't understand that.
I spoke at a conference last week where there was an economist on the stage saying, hey,
if we continue to average $150,000 unemployment, then employment rate is going to stay below
4%.
And I'm saying to myself, are you kidding?
And you're an economist.
That $150,000 came from the payroll survey.
The unemployment rate comes from the household survey.
The household survey actually showed employment declined $328,000.
I think it's a very important point because at turning points in both directions, GDI
leads GDP.
GDI is actually telling the recessionistas they're actually not far off the mark at all.
Right.
In fact, is it telling us that it's here now?
Because I know we had some negative quarters of GDI.
I'm saying it may be here and we just don't know it.
It's like, example, December 2007, you know, with all deference, the consensus, and I'm
not going to name names, they're my competitors back then.
But the soft landing was the mantra.
January, February, March, April, May, June, all the way to the summer of '08.
It wasn't until Lehman collapsed.
And that was September of '08 that the consensus said, oh, oh, I think we have a recession.
It started the summer of '07, started the summer of '07.
Even after Bear Stearns collapsed, it had to be taken out by JP Morgan.
The mantra, it's all contained.
And so that's the, and so because people, look, I've been doing this for 40 years.
Everybody lives in the here and now.
They can't seem to see past the tip of their nose.
And I wasn't even, it shouldn't have been that surprised.
Everybody's throwing in the recession call.
I'm saying that they're not really looking at the fact that we do have a lot of non-confirmations
out there.
Like, if we had GDI, let me just say this much, if GDI was where GDP is, people will
be saying, whoa, daddy, this economy is flattening.
You know, in the UK, the economy is flattening, and I don't think you're going to get an argument
from any UK economist that the next move is going to be negative.
If you're looking at the US economy from a real income perspective, it's already flattening.
But people look at real GDP and they look at non-farm payrolls because Jay Powell has
trained everybody non-farm payrolls.
It is a flawed statistic or the 40% response rate.
So the household survey is telling you something totally different.
At turning points in the cycle, like I said, you want to focus on the household survey,
not the non-farm survey.
At turning points in the cycle, you want to focus on GDI, not GDP.
It's a great point.
And David, you keep bringing up great points.
I want to respond to other ones and you bring up an even greater one too.
To your point there about what we're being told to watch, what we're being directed to,
these bad signals, if you will.
Are the central planners, Jay Powell and the crew at the Echos building, are they making
their decisions based off of this flawed data as well?
Is this akin to having a pilot that is looking at instrumentation that is telling him the
wrong thing?
It's hard to make up my mind what the Fed's looking at at any moment in time.
In one moment, they're focused on leisure, entertainment, they're focused on the service
sector.
Another time, they're focused on something else.
You don't know, one day they're focused on headline CPI, then the core CPI, then the
super core CPI.
I think that with the Fed, it's a much bigger picture and it's about their reaction function
and the reaction function to something that already happened in the past and they're going
to double down on a different mistake this time around by staying too tight for too long.
They stay too easy for too long and they miss the inflation bulge.
Now, we had inflation go from say 0% to 9% in 18 months.
Was 18 months transitory in the overall annals of economic history?
I'd say probably, but you can't be a central bank.
You can't be head of the world central bank and have a one month with 9% inflation.
Like they did bungle it, they bungled it.
It's a matter of hubris and shame and embarrassment and Jay Powell heading into his last term
being compared to Arthur Burns, not a good look.
He is corralled.
He's not had a descent and compared himself every step of the way through the tightening
cycle to Paul Volcker, not to Alan Greenspan, not to Ben Bernanke, not to Janet Yellen,
not to McChesney Martin, not to anybody else, to Paul Volcker.
What they're paying attention to is, I think what they have to see is a dramatic loosening
up in the labour market.
They want to see the labour market loosen up.
They clearly want to see these employment numbers contract and they want to see underlying
inflation continue to come down.
Now, I don't think that they're that arrogant that they're going to wait to cut rates the
month that core inflation or headline inflation gets to 2%.
But they are going to be deliberately slow, primarily because of the mistake they made
on the way up.
Like, what did Jay Powell say last week?
His biggest concern is cutting rates and then inflation comes back.
He still has it stuck in the 1970s when the Fed cut rates and then inflation would pick
up again.
He still has that framework and that has me concerned.
And so we paid in one way for a period of time with high-end rising inflation that's
come down.
And I think we're going to pay another price for the extreme degree of monetary restraint
that I think is going to create the conditions for deflation next year.
Okay.
Yeah.
And I'm curious.
And a recession that's going to be difficult to climb out of.
So do you feel that the Fed is kind of like with inflation, right?
For many years, they were talking about how we didn't have "enough inflation" and then
boom, we're at 9%.
Do you fear that they may get a lot more of what they want of right now?
Like, we want the job market to weaken.
We want the economy to slow to bring inflation down.
Do you feel like a year from now, we may be hearing the Fed scrambling to say, "Oh my
gosh, we totally overdid it.
We're losing way too many jobs.
Economy's in a deeper session."
I believe in the business cycle and I believe in the interstate cycle.
I believe that interest rates are cyclical.
I'm sorry, as you're talking, I'm going to bring up this chart from your organization
here, which I think really drives home the point you're making here, which is the criticality
of interest rates and how every time that we've had a recession in the past data set,
the past 40 years, it has come at a peak in interest rates.
Right.
And look at that period in the mid 90s.
Like I said before, Greenspan, for all his warts and scars and pimples, wasn't really
that arrogant.
He respected the bond curve, he respected the message from the bond market.
And so we had that run up in rates from 3% to 6% and the economy slowed and then we accelerated
of course, on the back of the dot com phrase and all the wealth that that generated plus
all the productivity.
But you can see from this chart in the shaded regions or recessions that the recession comes
after, after, after the Fed tightening cycle is over.
So shame on all of us for thinking that the recession was going to start this year because
they just completed the tightening cycle in July.
That was, in my opinion, the last rate hike was July.
And they will be drawing another recession band this time around, but you see the recessions
happen after the tightening cycle is done.
Great.
And you think it's done, I believe from reading some of your recent work is, you say that
history shows once you go five consecutive months without a hike, then a hiking cycle
is over.
Is that correct?
Done like dinner, which means it's done like dinner if they skip December, then it's over.
And then historically, the lag from the last rate hike to the first cut, and that always
happens.
You always get a cut after the last hike, like you always get a hike after the last
cut.
It's the history of the world.
It's how interest rates move in cycles.
That would therefore put the first easing if we're going to talk about the mean, which
is the norm and the norm is normal in May of next year.
Okay.
If we use the historical mean, the Fed will start cutting by May of next year.
Do you think that the Fed is going to wait to see some sort of evidence?
Is it going to react when it cuts?
Is it going to be in reaction to something or because it's hit its target and it's declaring
mission accomplished?
We either have a financial event or we have the payroll survey, which is what they pay
attention to begin to reflect with the household survey.
Can you imagine what would have happened two Fridays ago if non-farm payrolls printed minus
$328?
You see, it's an afterthought because it's in the wrong survey.
No, not to David Rosenberg, it's in the right survey, but I don't pull the monetary levers.
Can you imagine what's going to happen once GDP looks like GDI?
Can you imagine what's going to happen when the payroll number is going to look at the
household numbers and that is when you're going to see the Fed start to cut rates?
Yeah.
I mean, I think it'll be a mad scramble if we're at those numbers, but we're clearly
not there yet.
But to your point, you're thinking maybe we should be.
We're just looking at the wrong data.
That's what I'm saying, and they're going to be too late, but they're always too late
because it's an institution run by human beings who are very deliberative.
It's a slow moving, deliberate, incremental institution.
So were they slow?
Were they slow to raise rates in 2021, 2022?
Yes.
And will be the slow to cut rates?
Yes.
Do rates normally go above where we think they're going to go typically, then do they
usually go lower than we think they're going to go?
Yes, they do.
So historically, in a Fed easing cycle that is coupled with an economic recession, the
Fed cuts the funds rate 500 basis points to a T. That actually has a very small standard
deviation, how far the Fed goes.
Now, God forbid that would take us down close to the zero bound again.
Nobody believes that's going to happen.
I don't think you can rule it out.
Look how far the funds rate has gone ever since the early 1990s.
And in each time in real terms, the Fed funds rate goes to zero or negative.
In nominal terms, we got to 3%, you know, back in 1993.
That was unheard of back then.
And in the last three cycles, we went pretty well close to the zero bound.
But even if we don't go there, you've got to be thinking that just to remove the excessive
restraint, taking the funds rate down to the estimated neutral level of 2.5%, the Fed would
have to cut the funds rate 300 basis points just to get to neutral.
Just to get to neutral.
Right.
More than half.
And people say to me, well, your bullish interest rates, well, that's my answer.
Just to get to neutral, these guys have to cut 300 basis points from where they are right
now.
All right.
So I do want to get to the bond, your outlook for bonds, which are totally tied to that
real quickly.
You know, the way you're talking about the Fed always being late and, you know, things
just being the things overcorrecting, right?
It's the Fed driving the supertanker analogy, right?
Which is the Fed is navigating the US and largely the global economy with a much cruder
set of tools that I think most people realize.
And to equate it to a supertanker, basically they've got the ability to go left and right
on the steering wheel and fast or slow on the throttle.
And just like with a big tanker, if you're heading in one direction and turn the wheel
the other direction, it still takes a while for the momentum to slow down and then begin
to head the other way.
They think it's a slow, big process and it leads to these massive overcorrections.
So that's kind of what the dynamic we have here.
And to your point, these big, slow, but large overcorrections are really the lag effect.
So even if the Fed changes the wheel, we know for a good long while the lag effect of all
the momentum they've had going the other direction is going to take the tanker in that direction
for a good long while.
So you said the following, you said, based upon your read of the latest presser that
Powell had, you said you think that there's still a ton, he's signaling that there's still
a ton of tightening in the pipeline that we haven't seen yet.
And from your lens, it's no longer going to be camouflaged by raging fiscal stimulus.
And I want to get your confirmation of that, but if you can in your answer, address the
fiscal stimulus part because we've had the Fed out there actually actively trying to
slow things down by hiking and tightening, but at least in the US, we've had a lot of
fiscal spending this year, a crazy amount of fiscal spending from a historical standpoint.
How does that complicate the picture and why do you think that is finally going to start
getting dwarfed by the lag effect?
Well, for example, in terms of the spending side, a lot of that initial incremental thrust,
the biggest impact on growth really came this year when you're looking at the industrial
subsidies, the CHIPS Act, so on and so forth.
But 70% of GDP is, so let's just say that when we're talking about the Inflation Reduction
Act, the CHIPS Act, we're going to make the United States the lowest cost semiconductor
producer in the world.
Well, that's a bit of a joke.
And we've had a major boom in manufacturing, the construction of manufacturing facilities.
We've had the construction of these facilities to make America great again in terms of being
a world power and semiconductors that the growth in manufacturing, the construction
of manufacturing facilities is 60% year over year.
That's reflecting all those subsidies.
Meanwhile, where is manufacturing production in the United States year over year?
Minus one.
Minus 1%.
We actually had a manufacturing, so you see the thing is that what they're doing is it's
like, everyone should read up about Grigor Potemkin, who built these false cities, these
fake cities for Catherine the Great in Crimea.
It's a facade.
We're going to actually have these facilities mothballed.
The United States is not going to emerge as the world's low cost producer and semiconductors,
but it was certainly a great down payment on reelection prospects for next year, although
that's not looking so good for Joe Biden right now in any event.
So that's been a boom.
That's been a manufacturing construction.
Meanwhile, manufacturing production and manufacturing construction have gone in different directions.
We were going to have an industrial capacity problem in this country in the next couple
of years, because these projects are going to be mothballed.
So that was one form of stimulus.
The construction aspect.
And we had, as I said before, who knew, I mean, I wish that my crystal ball was that
clear that I was calling last year for the savings rate to get down towards 3%.
That was all the effects of the last vestige of the excess savings.
As I said before, history can take you so far.
Got it.
Sorry to interrupt.
So the drawdown of the savings rate, plus perhaps the increase of spending on revolving
credit basically acted as a consumer spending stimulus this year.
The revolving credit wasn't part of the fiscal stimulus, but that was part of the fact that
the credit spigots were open, but you see they've closed.
And the fiscal stimulus incrementally, and you can see it in the CBO numbers.
And look at the primary deficit to GDP, that it is no longer adding to growth.
We're going to have fiscal withdrawal next year, but what's not going away are the lagged
impacts, the lagged impacts.
You know, once again, you know, the Fed stopped tightening in the summer of '06, and we're
into '07, as everybody is still engaged in cash out refinancings, I kept on saying.
The Fed was done in the summer of '06.
There's no recession in '07.
That's okay, the yield converted, but I guess we can throw that away as a useless indicator.
They were seeing all that in '07.
So you see, yeah, 100% that what I'm saying is that we will see what the emperor looks
like disrobed next year without the fiscal stimulus, not just that, but we are seeing
cracks emerge in the labor market.
By the way, not just in the household survey, but also even in the payroll survey, because
it cannot be denied that companies have been cutting the hours worked.
You know, when you talk before about the household survey showing this radical shift towards
part-time from full-time, well, that's reflected in the payroll survey and the extent that
the work week has been getting cut.
And that's a leading indicator because hours lead bodies and what companies have been trying
to do is they've been trying to hang onto their staff because they don't want to relive
that miserable experience of a couple of years ago when they lost their staff because of
the shutdowns and then we had this massive labor mismatch, supply and demand, and they
couldn't find their employees.
So you know, even everybody's fighting the last war, the Fed's fighting the last war,
which is COVID-led inflation and some of the after-effects, but that's on the rearview
mirror and companies are fighting the last war.
They're fearful of losing their employees.
I don't think they're being benevolent because they really have to think about their shareholders
first and foremost.
So they've been cutting the hours instead of the bodies, but you can only do that for
so long.
So when you're taking a look, for example, at the index of aggregate hours worked, which
combines bodies and hours, even the payroll survey is showing that the employment market,
when you count in hours worked, is starting to stagnate.
What happens next is not going to be a reacceleration.
It's going to be the next move, that's what I was trying to say before about the soft
landing is that transition to the contraction phase of the economy.
It's just the business cycle at work.
Okay.
I want to just share one data point here with you, which I literally saw a few minutes before
I hopped on here with you, Michael Kantrowitz from Piper Sandler.
I've interviewed him a number of times because he has the HOPE framework.
You may or may not be familiar with it, David, but it's the progression for how an economy
falls into recession and each letter in HOPE stands, it's an acronym.
So housing, orders, profits, employment, and basically that's the order in which the domino
sort of fall.
So employment's kind of been this bulwark against recession right now.
So Matthew tracks employment really closely and he is beginning to really finally see
some visible big cracks opening up there and I have him on every two months or so to say,
"Hey, where are we on the E side of things?"
And he just sent me this chart saying, "Hey, I'm really finally beginning to see this E
domino start to wobble here.
Let me just pull this up if I can find it."
So here's the chart that he has.
This I believe, let me just make sure I'm saying this correctly, it's a three month
moving average of the underlying data, but he says a recession has likely begun when
the year over year change in unemployed persons gets above 10%.
And again, this is a percent change year over year.
And you'll see here, we're currently at 7.7%.
So you'll see all these past recessions that are shaded here in pink and you see this percent
change in unemployment start erupting as you head into the recession.
And this key threshold is 10%.
Well, here we are basically running pell-mell at that threshold.
We're not quite there yet, but you can see we're getting there in a big hurry right now.
So anyways, I thought you'd appreciate an additional supporting data point to what you're
saying here, but Michael's I think equally as concerned as you are, David, which is once
we kind of punctured some of those key thresholds, then it's game on for the recession.
Well, look, the only reason I'm concerned is because I'm finding it again, it's the
same concern I had in 2007 when I was at Mother Merrill is that almost everybody has their
head buried in the sand.
And I'm really going to hit it going a hundred miles an hour.
Well, I'm just saying it's no, I'm not saying it's not a hundred miles an hour.
I mean, as you said before, the economy is like a supertanker, it's not Bitcoin and it's
not the CRV and it's not the SPX.
It's, you know, a bad recession is a 2% decline in GDP.
But what I'm saying is that financial markets move in multiples of that move in GDP.
And I'm just concerned about, look, where do we close the VIX on Friday, 15?
What are we trading?
We're trading at 18 and a half times 2024 earnings, like seriously, look where credit
spreads are.
I'm just concerned that there was no asset class that is priced for the recession.
Nobody has safeguarded their portfolio or their asset mix against the recession.
Now, for people that have a 30-year view, take the Jeremy Siegel, I'll just invest for
the long run.
God bless you.
You know, you're not investing around the business cycle.
Good for you.
But for those that are investing around the business cycle, or when you consider what
it's like to have your head sliced off in a bear market, in a recessionary bear market,
can take you years to break even again.
You don't want to participate in those, but it doesn't matter because all I get back to
me is that 95% of the economists don't see a recession.
The Fed doesn't see a recession.
Nobody has these wild explanations.
I had one client say to me that I've not spent enough time talking about the 5% deposit rates
people have today and that you didn't have before.
They're going to spend that 5%.
There's no link between your interest rate and your savings deposit and your willingness
to spend that money.
There's no link there whatsoever.
That's interesting because I have heard that posited that, hey, that's a stimulus.
People don't spend that money.
Nobody says, hey, darling, we made extra $3,000 on our deposits.
Let's go on a Carnival cruise.
Nobody does that.
Nobody spent that interest income.
It's like people say to me, people spend their dividend income or do they reinvest it?
It's just basically, I'm just saying, I write every single day, I publish and I get back
the comments about why the recession isn't coming.
All these things about, for example, oh, the baby boomer inheritance is going to say, I'm
just getting, look, they were saying that back in '07, too, look, the cycle is the cycle.
For people who want to actually read about the power of cycles and why we talk about
cycles is that these patterns reemerge.
No two cycles are ever the same, but the patterns reemerge and the memories fade.
I just find that in our business, we're really just playing probabilities.
I'll be the first to say, hey, look, after being in this business for almost 40 years,
you don't throw all your eggs in one basket and there's no such thing as a sure thing.
I don't live in a zero or 100% probability world.
I live in a base case and how that base case is evolving.
And then what's your plan B if you're wrong?
So I don't even live in that world of saying the people are saying, well, if you're wrong
on your recession, because everybody, I had a meeting today with some senior officials
of one of the major rating agencies.
So actually said to me, we agree with you, Dave, we're going to have a mild recession.
This is one of the rating agencies.
I said, mild recession.
Yeah, but it's either going to be mild or severe.
It's not mild.
And we get to get it a jail free card after the most pernicious tightening cycles is 1981.
That's just not going to happen.
And so I think that what concerns me the most, the biggest concern is the level of complacency
to this day, the level of complacency.
Every economist throwing in the towel on the recession call, I don't know outside of myself,
if there is another say big name economist calling for a session, maybe Gary Shilling
is, I'm going to have him on my webcast at the end of the year.
Lacey Hunt, again, us old timers that have been through, been around the track a few
times.
These are the guys with experience, right?
I mean, I mean, yeah, well, I'm just saying, you know, it's a, I can understand the pressures
that a Wall Street economist has because of the masters at the big banks.
Sure.
Because it's called the sell side for reason we have product.
But I'm saying, but people listen to these guys, and these women, and it concerns me,
it concerns me that that the investment community is not prepared, right, and sleepwalking into
this, this, this issue.
I'm not going to say the recession is inevitable, maybe, maybe this is the one time, maybe this
is the one time, maybe.
But you've got to basically attach probabilities to outcomes.
Have your portfolio and your asset mix reflect all these different outcomes, the across the
continuum of outcomes, what is the reward of being right benchmarked against the cost
of being wrong?
And I just find that right now, a lot of investors are going to be caught offside, just as they
were in 2001, just as they were in 2008.
And I'm not going to say that it's going to be the same as a tech wreck.
I'm not going to say this is going to be a banking crisis.
I'm not saying that at all, it'll be different.
But the reality is this, the stock market may well be telling you that the recession
is coming because the average stock and the median stock is not the S&P 500, which has
been dominated by the Magnificent Seven, the stock market and the most domestically cyclical
stocks are telling you something, and it's not over.
And the Treasury market, so we're going to talk about the Treasury market, and here's
what I want to say about the Treasury market, Adam, is this.
All I got was grief for months.
Now, of course, the 10-year note got briefly above 5%, now it's 4.6% and change.
And everybody's talking about how high Treasury yields are.
Look at how high Treasury yields are.
But actually, they're not high.
They're low, benchmarked against what's most important for the Treasury market, which is
the Fed funds rate.
And I think that people, including me, by the way, but I try and answer these questions.
Everybody poses the question as to why it is at this time, after all the higher for
longer, higher for longer, higher for longer narrative, the sticky, sticky, sticky, sticky
inflation narrative, why is the entire Treasury curve in terms of yield below not just the
Fed funds rate today, but where the Fed is telling you they think the funds yield will
be at the end of next year.
Why is that?
Because ratios mean revert.
The yield curve is a mean reverting series.
If this was a normal yield curve, if this is actually a normal environment with a normal
yield curve, yield curve has been inverted since the summer of 2022.
It's only inverted 15% of the time.
You don't need a CFA certificate to know about the time value of money.
We've been inverted.
What's the bond market telling you?
Probably telling you what the average stock is telling you.
Why is the entire bond curve trading below the Fed funds rate today?
Because if it was normal, if it was normal, if the bond market was telling you that we
are going into something very cool, which is a no landing, then the 10-year note would
be 6.5% today, not 4.6%.
So can I answer your question?
Yeah.
So the reason why the bond market remains inverted on the long end of the curve is because
it is telling us that it is expecting lower interest rates in the future.
And expecting lower interest rates in the future because the economy is going to go
into either a protracted slowdown.
A lot of people don't like the word recession.
You see, they don't.
When I actually look people in the eye and I use the word recession, it's as if I'm calling
their kid ugly.
So that's why Gerald Ford in the mid '70s wanted to call it a banana.
We won't call it a recession.
So the bond market is telling you about a deep, protected slowdown.
And if it is, it's telling you that there's not a snowball's chance in hell that we deserve
an 18+ multiple on next year's earnings right now.
This stock is still way too expensive as an asset class.
And so it's also telling you something about inflation.
And we have goods deflation already.
It's actually incredible that one of the past month oil prices are down, gasoline price
is down 6%, oil is down 10%.
All the gurus were saying with the war in the mid-east and the OPEC extension of the
output cuts.
Adam, weren't we?
I mean, there's people that only follow the oil price for their livelihood.
We're telling us we're supposed to be $100 by now.
They were saying, yeah, get ready for $120.
So you know why oil prices are going down because we're having demand destruction.
The United States is a nation of drivers.
No other nation is a nation of drivers like America.
And household spending in volume terms on motor fuel and gasoline is -2.1% on a year
of a year basis.
That hardly ever happens outside of recessions.
If you look at the average over the past 60 years, real spending, physical volume spending,
unit spending on gasoline that fill up the tank is +3%.
We're -2.1% right now.
So we're seeing the demand destruction already in something near and dear to every American,
which is the automobile.
And so we're filling it up by less than we did in the past, in the recent past.
So the food prices, they're starting to come down.
Look at the agricultural index, the CRB ag index, the raw industrials.
Look at copper.
The commodity complex and the US dollar has been strengthening.
We have actually goods deflation.
That's 40% of the CPI.
Now what about services?
Well, over half of services are the rents, the imputed rents, OER, actual rents, but
the way they're calculated is just built in three-year lags.
That's going to take a while for that to come down.
But think about this, I said before that the San Fran Fed is the Fed district bank that
produces the best research in my opinion.
They just put out a report not too long ago showing the lags of real-time rents, which
are deflating.
Real-time rents are deflating.
And they trace that through that by the second half of next year, the rents and the CPI,
the rental data will be flat to negative.
Think about taking something that's a third of the index, running close to 8%, 7% to 8%
year-over-year, taking a third of that to say zero, just knocked off two and a half
to three percentage points off a headline inflation rate that's running barely more
than three and a half percent.
So when people say to me, do you think we'll get to 2% inflation anytime in the horizon?
I say, yeah, let's just say that by this time next year, we're probably at or below 1% of
the headline inflation rate.
And no, there's not a snowball's chance in hell that even a sadistic central bank will
not adjust interest rates because if they don't, real rates are going to go up that
much more and we're going to have not just a mild recession, but something a lot worse
than that.
So of course rates are going to come down, you're going to have a recession or something
close to it, and you're going to have disinflation and that will blaze the trail for a renewed
easing cycle.
But you see, nobody seems to believe it.
But with all due respect, nobody in 1989 ever thought the Fed would cut the funds rate again
at the peak.
Nobody in 2000 when the funds rate was six and a half percent, if you told anybody at
the funds rate peak of six and a half percent in the winter of 2000 that Alan Greenspan
on the first trading day of the year on January 3rd of 2001 would be cutting the funds rate
intermeeting by 50 basis points, you'd have been carried out in a gurney.
And the same thing in 2006, you know, the funds rate is five and a quarter, they'll
never cut rates again, they'll never cut rates again, oh really?
And just today, they're not going to cut rates.
And the Fed's telling you they're not going to cut rates.
And so do you want to believe the Fed, like with all seriousness, at the end of 2021,
the end of 2021, I'm not going back five years or 10 years, we're going back to the end of
2021, the median thought plot for the end of this year was one and five eighths.
And for the end of next year was two and an eighth.
And now they're saying no, no, five handled, as far as the eye can see, this is like a
classic case of Charlie Brown and Lucy with the football.
Can you imagine if you were, no wonder these poor regional banks were so offside in their
bonds, they believed the Fed.
Sometimes you got to make your bets against the Fed.
And I'd have to admit, that's what I'm doing with my fixed income call right now.
Okay, well, let's just dive into that as we wrap things up here.
And by the way, you've given us an hour already.
Thank you so much, David, for being so generous.
So you expect that the next move is going to be a cut on the Fed side of things, that
we very well may be in recession next year, that inflation may be down to the 1% level
by the end of next year.
And the odds aren't bad, and correct me if any of these words are wrong, but that the
Fed may get into scramble mode at some point next year.
And so you think that the federal funds rate is likely to come down in 2024.
That's going to be beneficial for bonds because of the inverse relationship between bond prices
and yields.
And obviously that's felt disproportionately the longer duration the bond is.
So you have been saying in some of your recent work, it's a good time to be looking at the
long dated US treasuries.
Elaborate on that logic, and hopefully I got it right.
And secondly, you've had a long career, as you've mentioned several times.
How attractive does the treasury bond trade right now look relative to other points in
your career?
Well, it looks as attractive as it did the last time that we were close to these levels
back in the summer of 2007.
And the major point is this, it's back to Bob Farrell's rule number one on mean reversion.
The yield curve is a ratio, short term rates, long term rates.
So I believe that the yield curve will normalize, that it will mean revert.
How will it mean revert?
It'll mean revert and revert to a positive slope.
And remember, historically, two tens is not negative.
Historically two tens is more like 150 basis points in terms of that spread, wider if you
go to the long bond.
Well, it's going to normalize one of two ways.
Either I am dead wrong on inflation, we're going to have another massive inflationary
surge, and the back end of the curve is going to go wild to the upside in terms of yield.
That's a bear steepening.
That's what I would be calling that.
Bear steepening.
Or it's going to happen the way I think it's going to happen, especially looking at where
we are in the cycle and the cracks we're seeing in the economy and the disinflation momentum
and the leading indicators for inflation.
The New York Fed's own leading inflation indicators telling you all this is going to happen, that
the Fed is going to have to cut the funds rate.
Now, just to get to neutral, they've got to cut the funds rate 300 basis points.
Think about that for a second.
The curve will go through, I think, a bull steepener.
The biggest decline will be at the front end of the curve.
But the front end of the curve is more like you might as well just own money market.
I mean, if you're going to go for the gusto and maximize your potential returns in a bull
steepener, it's coupled with a recession and coupled with disinflation, you want to own
the back end of the curve for the convexity because the price increase is going to dominate
your total return.
So you'll make a little bit of money, at least you won't lose money like you will in credit
or in equities or even commodities.
And there's no doubt you're taking on duration risk when you're buying the long bond.
But that risk morphs into tremendous reward if I'm right, as to where the contours of
the business cycle are taking us.
So I think that we will see double digit returns out of the curve in the next year.
That's my strongest conviction call for 2024.
And that's for an asset with no principal risk and pays you along the way.
100%, no capital risk and more to the point, I'm looking at it, I'm not saying you're going
to buy a 30-year bond and hold on to it for 30 years, like people say, who would want
to own this thing at like whatever.
At some point, if the equity risk premium normalizes, think of the equity risk premium,
80 basis points.
So that's the comparison between the earnings yield or the inverse of the PE in the stock
market, say the yield you get in the treasury market.
It's insane.
It's a two standard deviation event.
Normally, that's 300 to 350 basis points, it's 80 basis points.
Right.
It's the lowest it's been, I think, in 25 years or so.
Yeah.
And so basically, what is the math that mean reverts that is 30 to 3300 on the S&P, ouch,
I know.
And two and a half to 3% of the 10-year note.
So we got to respect, we got to pay respect to Bob Furrow's rule number one, it applies
to the yield curve, it applies to the savings rate, it applies to the equity risk premium.
So I look at all these variables, and the path only leads one way, which is towards
lower interest rates out the curve, just the beauty but the long bond is the convexity
and the price appreciation is going to come along with that trade.
All right.
At some point, at some point, if we get the ERP, all this stuff happens, the yield curve
normalizes, we're 70% of the recession, people start to hide under the desk and say the recession
will never end.
Now they're saying the expansion will never end.
Once all that happens, and the ERP gets to 300 basis points, I'll be coming on your show,
and I'll be coming bullish on equities and bearish on treasuries that day.
That's a deal whenever you're at that stage, you give me a call, David, we'll bring you
on.
David, this has been fantastic.
I'm trying not to abuse your generosity here.
One last question before we wrap it up.
I mean, obviously, the answer depends on the individual and folks should talk to their
individual financial advisors for this stuff.
But do you have a point of view on in terms of taking advantage of this long duration
treasury trade of owning some of the ETFs that buy long duration treasuries versus buying
the treasuries directly yourself?
Yeah, I think that I would, as an investor, again, I said before, no such thing as a sure
thing, don't put all your eggs in one basket.
You can own different parts of the curve, at least in the two year note, you're getting
paid handsomely to take on no risk whatsoever, not even risk, except, you know, you'll give
up the capital appreciation, assuming my forecast proves prescient.
I think that you just want to buy the long bond, if you're an equity investor, buy the
TLT.
But I think you just want to go out there and just buy the ten year note or buy the
long bond or buy long dated zeros.
You can buy those.
You don't have to go to some bond fund and I would just buy them individually.
But I would have I would have toes, definitely more than one toe in the long bond.
Got it.
Okay.
I'll just let folks know if you want to buy them directly yourselves, you can do that
via the US Treasury on the Treasury Rec website, or you can do that pretty much in any major
brokerage fund.
And if you can't figure out how to do that easily, just call the company itself and they'll
have one of their people walk you through how to do it.
David, this has just been fantastic.
Let's make it a deal when everything happens and you switch and you get bearish bonds and
bullish equities, come back on the channel.
But I want you to come back on long before then, whenever you feel like you've got something
on your radar that's important to communicate to the world, this platform is open to you
any time.

My favorite four-letter word that starts with F, just to show you that I talk my book when
it comes to disinflation.
Of course, I charge for my services, but I like people to kick our tires and have come
to, come and have a free meal before, you know, you become a full-fledged member.
And it's been a very successful way of doing business.
So feel free to come on the website and you'll have a full month of free smorgasbord, and
then we can talk about what it is that you want to buy and what you don't want to buy
thereafter.
We're very flexible.
Awesome.
Well, David, look, when we edit this, we will put up the link to your website there so folks
know exactly where to go.
I love that as a nice Canadian, your F word is free, much classier than us here in the
States.
So anyways, it's been fantastic.
Folks, if you'd like to thank David for coming on here and encourage him to come back on

David is one of the first in a thunderous lineup of folks that are at least close to
his stature and level of gravitas that are going to be coming on this new channel over
the next couple of weeks and months to find out more about them and get all my updates
on what lies ahead for this new Thoughtful Money channel.
Just go subscribe for free to my substack.
That's at adamtaggett.substack.com.
David, I can't thank you enough for coming on here.
I'm going to let you have the last word and just any parting bits of advice you have for
today's investors that are really eager to try to navigate what's ahead safely and to
keep their wealth intact.
Well, I think that you said the right word.
You said safely.
So I would just say in two words or less, what should we concentrate on is capital preservation.
That doesn't go out of style.
And in four words or less, the theme for 2024 will be bonds have more fun.
Play it safe and bonds have more fun.
Thank you so much, David.
Really appreciate it.
Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
We'll see you next time.
Thank you.
