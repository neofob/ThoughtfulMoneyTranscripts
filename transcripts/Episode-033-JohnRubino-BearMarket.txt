Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart.
How stable is our current system?
Economically, geopolitically, and socially?
Well, the market seems confident it's quite stable,
but you don't have to look that hard
to find evidence of stress fractures.
From recessionary leading indicators
to struggling consumer households
to the frozen real estate market,
to the breakdown of trade through the Red Sea,
to the loss of faith in once premier establishment brands
like Harvard, to the polarization and cynicism
of this year's US presidential election.
What's more likely to happen from here?
A cent or breakdown?
To discuss, we're fortunate to welcome monetary
and macro analyst, John Rubino, to the program,
author and co-author of numerous books,
including The Money Bubble with James Turk.
John, thanks so much for joining us today.
- Hey Adam, good to be back.
- And congratulations on your new media empire.
Very impressive couple of months you've had here.
- Thank you, thank you so much.
We've definitely been running really hard
to try to get things off the ground here,
but yes, incredibly pleased and grateful
for how well so far, at least,
thoughtful money has been received
and the amount of viewers we have watching this stuff.
It's been great.
Now that we've landed the great John Rubino,
I expect all those numbers to just go bananas from here, John.
- Well, I hope you hope at the margin, yeah.
- Well, thanks.
And just full disclosure, John, you and I are good friends.
We've been good friends for a long time.
We have lots of conversations privately
where just one of us will call
and we'll just sort of talk for hours
about what's going on in the macro world and whatnot.
Kind of hoping today's discussion will be just like that,
except we'll be letting the audience sit along here with us.
So get a number of questions
based upon some of the things we've talked about recently
in our own discussions, but also what you've posted
on your sub stack as well.
Before I get into those specific topics though,
let's just kick things off if we can
with a general question I like to ask at the beginning.
What's your current assessment of the global economy
in financial markets?
- Well, the long-term assessment is nightmarish
because debt is going parabolic pretty much everywhere
and that can't end badly.
For the year ahead, I think a stat
that might help a lot of people understand
what's coming is something called excess savings.
Basically during the pandemic,
the government said to a lot of people,
okay, you don't have to pay your rent,
you don't have to pay your student loans
and here we'll send you some STEMI checks.
So a lot of people saved a decent amount of money
and the excess savings stat is a measure
of what people have in the bank
above what they would be expected to have in the bank
if previous trends had continued.
So a lot of people ended up with some extra money
and they've been spending it
and that's why the economy has continued to grow.
That money's basically gone then,
except for maybe the top 10% of the incomes out there.
Most people have spent their excess savings
and now they're working through regular savings.
And in a lot of cases, you're seeing people
in order to maintain their lifestyle
start maxing out credit cards.
So credit card debt is way up,
it's above a trillion dollars now
and credit card interest is 20 to 25%.
So you've got some of the people out there.
- Record high APIs.
- Yep, yeah.
So you've got a lot of people out there
who are putting their day-to-day lives on credit cards
and then carrying balances that charge them 20 or 25%,
which is basically like going to the local loan shark.
It's that exact same kind of financial death spiral
that you put yourself in.
So because of that, consumer spending,
which is the driver of the U.S. economy
and most of the rest of the world's economy
via the U.S. economy, cannot grow.
You can't have people in that situation going out then
and borrowing more money to buy big, useless things,
which is basically the driver of the U.S. economy.
So I think we see a dramatic slowdown
in consumer spending next year,
which leads to a dramatic decline in corporate profits.
So you get a slowing, maybe a recessionary economy
because of the spending,
and then you get an equities bear market
because of crashing corporate profits.
And you put those two together and it's a very bad year,
very different from 2023,
which was 2023 was a kind of a turbulent year,
but most of the trends were either flat to slightly up.
Well, next year it's gonna be turbulent
with most of the trends pointing in the other direction.
So that's my outlook for the year ahead.
And that's probably the best case scenario.
You know, there's very few ways that it can get better,
but lots of ways that it can come in much, much worse
than what I just spelled out.
- That's an interesting way to say it.
So few ways for it to get better,
lots of ways for it to get worse.
Okay, so great jumping off point, little concerning,
obviously.
So it sounds like, you know, you're saying 2023
was kind of the year where the pig of the stimulus
exited the Python,
at least in the consumer household standpoint,
but consumers, instead of saying, okay,
the excess savings that I had are gone,
I need to start tightening my belt.
Instead, they said, I'm gonna keep my lifestyle going
at this level for as long as I can.
But I'm gonna start, you know,
charging it more to credit cards,
which we've seen the record increase
in credit card debt levels at record APRs,
as we just mentioned.
One other thing that's happened concurrent with that though,
has been the savings rate has come down.
So the current US savings rate is lower
than its historical average.
So something that David Rosenberg was talking about,
which has sort of added as an additional stimulus
to the system,
which is that people have just been willing to save less
and spend the difference in this interim period
that's been going on here.
The other thing that you mentioned,
which plays off of a term I first heard
from our good friend, Charles Hugh Smith,
back, you know, leading up to the great financial crisis.
So this was a long time ago,
but it was the concept of debt saturation,
where, you know, consumers will take on as much debt
as they can get away with taking on.
But at some point they get to a point
where they can't take anymore on, right?
Either because taking on more debt will prevent them
from being able to service the current debts that they have,
or the lenders just cut them off and say,
"Look, I'm looking at your personal balance sheet,
"you're done, I'm not giving you any more money."
And we're not yet, it seems at that point in time yet,
but it seems like we're sort of hurtling towards that.
So did I sort of capture your view of the consumer here,
which is that, you know,
all the benefits of the free money are gone,
all the forbearance programs have been removed,
they've ratcheted down their savings
to keep things going longer,
they've ratcheted up their debt spending,
but they're kind of barreling towards this period
where they're just not gonna be able to continue that.
- Yeah, and you know, it's important to understand
that we're not dissing American consumers right now,
'cause a lot of these people are in very bad shape.
- Survival mode basically, yeah.
- We've created, yeah, a whole generation of people
who are now at the point where they have to decide
between paying to drive to work, paying the rent,
and feeding their kids, and you know, choose two,
and don't do the other one.
So a lot of people with that,
that ties into the credit card thing
where a lot of people are saying,
all right, look, I can't cut out any of those things
that I can't afford now,
so let me just put it on plastic this month
and see how it goes.
And meanwhile, you've got this tiny group
of maybe 10% of the economy getting richer
year after year after year.
So this is basically the aristocracy harvesting the peasants
that we're seeing in real time now,
just a modern version of that.
And there's a limit to how far you can go
with a policy like that, because as you said,
eventually people get so tapped out
that they can't even get a new credit card,
you know, which, how bad does it have to be
when the credit card companies won't lend you money?
'Cause that really is, you know,
it's a version of loan sharking, basically,
the credit card industry,
and it's in their interest
to lend non-creditworthy people money,
because those guys are the ones who run up the late fees
and carry a balance and somehow scrape up the payment
to cover that 20% this month.
You know, they make most of their money
off of people like that.
And if they're at the point
where they're not gonna lend to those guys anymore,
you know things are bad.
And basically we're heading that way.
You can argue about where we are in the process.
You know, maybe it's today that we're gonna hit that wall,
or maybe it's six months from now,
but the wall is coming because a growing number of people
just flat out can't afford their life anymore.
And-
- Well, let me note that that's happening
at historically very low unemployment, right?
So obviously any kind of spike in unemployment
just makes the situation way worse, right?
- Okay, that kind of leads us into how they're lying to us
if that works in the questions that you have laid out,
because it's a very interesting story,
the unemployment rate and the labor market in general,
because the way the government does this
is they'll report a really favorable number
of, you know, 2000 or a 25, wait, in this case,
250,000 new jobs. - 200, yeah.
- Yeah, generated this month.
And then the New York Times and the Washington Post
will jump on board with positive headlines
and Paul Krugman will come out and say,
I don't see why people are upset, you know?
Don't they realize that the unemployment rate
is at a record low level?
And so here's what happens.
In subsequent months, the government goes back
and it revises those jobs numbers
down to a level that would be disappointing
if that was the headline number originally.
And then analysts look through the jobs report
for the fine print and they find out
that there's actually really bad news in there.
And in the last one, it turns out that full-time jobs
are shrinking and part-time jobs are soaring,
which is a sign of an unhealthy economy,
not a healthy economy,
'cause it means people are losing their full-time jobs
and then having to cobble together
two or three part-time jobs at 12 or 15 hours a week
in order to-- - No benefits.
- Yeah, oh yeah, nothing like that.
And this time around, there was a stat
that I'd never seen before, but that is pretty telling.
And that is that the number of people
who are holding two full-time jobs is spiking.
And if you have a good full-time job,
the last thing you do is go out
and take another full-time job, right?
So this is people who, with a full-time job,
can't pay their bills and are going out
and getting another one, and they're working 16 hours a day
and just coming home and crashing
and getting up and doing it again.
And they're a nightmare for their family
because they can't be happy people while they're doing this.
But those people are soaring in this economy.
So when you think of the unemployment rate being very low
and you think of those big jobs numbers and everything,
they're kind of a mirage.
It's not actually that way.
And if you took out the part-time jobs,
you would see that the unemployment rate
is actually kind of high.
And that ties into the amount of debt
that people are taking on
because in a great employment economy,
you don't have people maxing out their credit cards, right?
Because you're making enough to cover day-to-day bills.
So we have multiple signs that that's not the case out there
and that leads to the conclusion
that the economy is heading for very rocky times
in the not too distant future.
- Okay, so I agree with everything you've said,
and I've talked a lot on this program
about how distrustful the official jobs numbers appear to be.
And that said,
I think the jobs market has held up much more robustly
in the face of all the other sort of negative
recessionary indicators that we have.
And even things like the quits rate was still pretty high
until recently, that's now coming down, right?
So I think the pendulum of power
is switching back to the employer.
My point is we're not in an environment yet
that we typically see where we enter a recession
where you have like hundreds of thousands
of jobs losses a month, right?
And so my only point is I think it's not nearly as robust
as the official jobs numbers that come out are suggesting,
but I think it's still kind of hanging in there-ish
even though it's deteriorating quality-wise
in all the ways that you mentioned.
My point is, boy, if we get to a point
where job losses really begin in earnest,
this sort of large swath of consumer households
that you're saying are just hanging on
by their fingernails right now,
boy, a lot of those people will lose their grip
in that type of environment.
- Oh yeah, we'll see that's the nightmare to come.
Actually, there was a survey that just came out today
that said that four of 10 companies
that responded to the survey
are planning layoffs in the year ahead.
So it's starting to come
and it'll snowball when it does come,
but the driving force will be lower consumer spending
because as consumers spend less,
companies no longer need as many people
to cover the lower number of orders they've got coming in
and they start laying people off.
In other words, typical recession behavior.
And that seems to be something
that's coming in the coming year
'cause a half a point lower interest rate
does not fix any of this.
And that's basically our only policy right now.
You've got the federal government running big surpluses,
or I'm sorry, big deficits,
but a lot of that is just them paying interest
on their debts and that's flowing
into rich people's bond accounts.
So that doesn't generate extra spending necessarily.
And at the same time,
if mortgages drop from 8% to 6.5%,
that still doesn't make houses affordable
for very many people.
So wherever you look, you need much lower interest rates
in order to reignite spending.
And we'll see that.
I think by the end of this year,
there'll be deeply into easing and QE
and we'll see interest rates coming back down
and then we'll see what happens.
It's not clear that this is fixable
with any kind of an interest rate because debt is so high,
but we'll see if it is.
I didn't think we could get past the 2008, 2009 economy.
I thought that was basically the end for the system
and it wasn't.
We bought ourselves 10 more years
or actually now 13 or 14 more years
at the cost of what, $50 trillion of new debt globally.
And we'll try that again.
But the question is, will it work?
And I think the numbers are just too big.
- Yeah, well, you get into the law
of diminishing returns territory, right?
Where you have to do an awful lot more
just to try to achieve the same impact you had before, right?
And at some point it just doesn't work.
So we'll see.
Future will tell us what's gonna happen there,
but I'm assuming,
and I'm getting a little bit ahead of us here,
but I'm assuming you think that
when the next down cycle happens,
the amount of policy, stimulus, response, et cetera,
will be gargantuan.
- Yeah, well, each cycle is bigger
and the amount of QE that'll be necessary
to bail out this new, more indebted system
necessarily has to be bigger, right?
And it'll be that way around the world
in Japan and Europe, for sure, China, obviously, the US.
So yeah, I think that the next time around will be bigger.
It'll be one for the record books,
but the question is, will it...
Oh, you know what?
And the lesson that's gonna be learned
for us starting to cut interest rates here,
'cause we basically hit the level of interest rates
that cannot be sustained.
We figured that out.
And now we've got to stop raising and start cutting.
The lesson for that for the financial markets
will be that, okay, we figured out
that interest rates can never go back up again,
because when they do, this is what happens.
But we've also figured out that we can't continue
to pump out huge amounts of currency
and run massive deficits, 'cause then we get 2022.
We get double digit inflation.
And those are our only two choices.
So finally, we're in that box where nothing works
and the markets realize that there's no adult supervision.
There's no big fix coming when daddy gets home.
And it'll be interesting to see what happens,
but when financial markets start to panic,
we have examples of that in the past, it's not pretty.
And that is arguably where we're headed
because there really isn't any kind of a fix.
And any fix you do choose makes the other problem worse.
So we've been going back and forth.
And now we're at the point where it isn't clear
what we can do going forward
that doesn't make our other problems much more serious.
Okay, so we're kind of getting
maybe to the punchline early here,
but let's think about what that means
for markets and asset prices.
If the world got to a point where it said,
all right, look, we can't raise interest rates
because the system just can't support it,
but we can't flood the world with a bunch of stimulus
because we'll create crazy inflation
and kill the purchasing power of our currencies,
even though I think push comes to shove,
a politician will always choose the latter.
But if enough of the market wakes up to the fact
of the world really being in that bind,
what happens to asset prices?
Well, we do exactly what you just said.
We conclude that the central banks of the world
are going to have to choose inflation
because that's a slower process.
Deflation is an immediate collapse back to the 1930s.
And nobody wants to be in charge
of that kind of an event, right?
Herbert Hoover of your generation
will know your name a hundred years from now
as the guy who screwed up the global economy.
So you're not gonna do that.
What you're gonna do is create enough new currency,
cut interest rates enough
to get yourself through the next election cycle.
And you look back at 2022 and think,
okay, that was disturbing, but we got through that.
So you recreate those conditions.
You start creating massive amounts of new currency,
you cut interest rates.
And so we'll get negative interest rates again,
in other words, and we'll get a big jump
in the money supply, in other words,
because that's their only immediate choice.
And once the markets figure that out,
then you're in the Austrian School
of Economics crack-up boom, right?
We finally get these things
that we've been talking about forever,
where people look at what's happening,
conclude that it's the official policy of the government
to inflate away the currency, and they act accordingly.
They dump the currency as soon as they get paid,
they buy real stuff,
the price of real stuff goes through the roof,
that's inflation, and that scares everybody.
And the cycle just kind of ratchets up from there
until total faith is lost in the economy or in the currency.
And you get what looks like a hyperinflation,
but it's actually a collapse of confidence in the currency.
And yeah, we've always been headed that way,
and now it just feels like you can kind of create a scenario
in which it happens sooner rather than later.
- Okay, and so for folks watching,
you used the term crack-up boom,
but that's sort of what you're talking about,
which is when the world, the jig is up,
folks realize how the game is being played
and everybody starts dumping the currency
as fast as they can because they don't expect it
to hold its purchasing power, as you said,
prices are real things, go to the moon.
All right, so you've written the book, "The Money Bubble,"
you actually founded a website that you no longer run,
someone else now does, called dollarcollapse.com.
So I know we've had viewers that have been very concerned
about the dollar going through this process.
If it does, and feel free to clarify
whether you think it indeed will or not,
if that's the true end game here,
when will it go through this process
relative to the other currencies?
So there's a lot of weaker players
on the global chess board than the US.
Do you expect us to sort of see this coming
as a rippling wave from the outside towards us,
or do you expect this sort of to happen everywhere
all at once to the currencies together?
- Yeah, well, I should premise this by referencing
what you just said about the Dollar Collapse website
and the book.
So I've been at this for a while and my credibility
when it comes to short-term predictions is not so great.
The long-term thing is in place, but as I said before,
I thought that 2008, 2009 was the end and it wasn't.
So we can't know for sure what the next year holds.
Now, when you look at all these fiat currencies out there,
they're all depreciating just at varying rates.
And that's how you get this whole, oh, one is strong
and one is weak thing that you always see on CNBC or whatever
and what that is is just one currency falling less quickly
than the other currencies.
And that's been the case with the dollar for a while.
And I think there's a case to be made that in a world
that's very stressful and very turbulent
that the dollar benefits 'cause the US is relatively safe,
not just financially, but militarily and economically
compared to the rest of the world.
So when there's trouble in the world,
even if the US causes the trouble,
that tends to make the dollar hold up relatively well
against other currencies 'cause capital flows from China
and Brazil and Europe to here and that bids up the,
well, it lowers our interest rates
and bids up the value of the dollar, relatively speaking.
And that could happen again.
So it could be that other currencies fall first,
but it's almost not even worth building something like that
into an investment thesis 'cause they're all falling.
The dollar is gonna lose probably an accelerating amount
of value in the next five years or so,
even leaving everything else except finance aside.
But the Japanese yen, the Euro, my God,
they're in much bigger trouble
because they have very few options right now.
You look at Europe and Germany screwed up its energy system
on such a monumental scale and screwed up
a lot of the rest of its economy too
by making bad mistake after bad mistake
that they're doing something
called deindustrialization now.
They literally can't run the industrial machinery
that used to make them such a powerhouse
with their energy costs where they are
and with the debt that they're taking on across Europe.
So it's debated about whether they're just not gonna be
an industrial power anymore
or whether they're gonna be less of an industrial power,
but either way, they're headed in that direction.
And the Eurozone only functioned as a currency union
because Germany was this-
- It was a Germany strike.
- Yeah, Germany was the best-run country in the world.
It was a financial and industrial powerhouse,
and it was potentially a military powerhouse
if it wanted to be.
And that made Italy's bonds and Greece's bonds
effectively German bonds and people could buy them
knowing that the ECB, which was backed up by Germany,
would stand ready to buy those bonds
if there was any trouble.
Well, that's all kind of all gone now.
So it's not clear what happens to the Euro.
Japan has taken on more government debt per capita
than any other society in human history.
And if interest rates even go,
their government bond interest rates
even go up to the levels of the US,
which is theoretically the most AAA credit out there,
Japan's government would be flat out bankrupt.
They would be paying out more in interest
than they would be taking in in tax revenue.
And so they would have an almost immediate
currency dust spiral once they pass that line, you know?
And those things are out there waiting to happen
with no fixes at all.
Now, in the process of that,
the dollar might actually look like a strong currency
because it's only losing 8.5% official inflation here.
You know, that's all that it's losing
in terms of purchasing power, according to the government.
But it's still losing a lot of purchasing power
and it's still not a good thing to own.
So at this point you get into basically
the investment thesis, which is real assets.
You know, you wanna buy things that governments
can't inflate away and switch your financial assets
into a broad portfolio of real assets over time.
And by the way, that doesn't mean that government bonds
in the US won't periodically be good investments.
They were actually good things to own
for the past six months, right?
Interest rates went down and that makes bond prices go up.
So there's some embedded capital gains in bonds right now,
you know, but it does mean that over time,
the dollars those bonds pay you will be worth less and less.
Therefore the bonds themselves will be worth
less and less in real terms.
So you wanna move out of those and into other things,
you know, and so this is all set up basically to happen.
It's baked in the cake because of all the debt
that we've taken on.
And Adam, one thing that's important to note here
is that we're only talking finance so far,
but it's a lot of other things out there that-
- Well, exactly.
- Much bigger than finance going forward.
- And I have some of these on my list,
but feel free to add, you know, any of the other ones
that are keeping you up at night to this.
I did just wanna, and look, I mean,
I know generally where you are, John, from our relationship
and, you know, no surprise to folks,
a guy who created a website called dollarcollapse.com,
you know, sort of thinks this ends badly
for all fiat currencies, including, you know,
the big dog on the block, the US dollar.
But it sounds like from what you're saying,
it is an even more pressing issue for people elsewhere
in the world, given the fact that the dollar
may be the last of the sinking ships to sink.
And in using that sinking ship analogy, Russ Gray,
folks may remember him, he was on the panel
and had the Future of Money panel on this channel
about a month and a half ago.
He gave me an analogy once that stuck in my mind.
I've always said the analogy of you think of boats
in a harbor, they all have holes in them,
they just have a different number of holes.
So the boats are sinking at different rates
relative to each other.
So if the Japanese yen is sinking faster than the US ship is
it actually looks to the Japanese ship
like the US ship is rising, right?
So this is how you explain the different variations
in currencies, but they are all falling
relative to some absolute benchmark,
in this case, the waterline, right?
And that's where I think you can use gold
sort of as a proxy for the waterline, right?
They're all sinking relative to a fixed real asset
like gold.
Russ's analogy was, I think the US dollar,
like the Titanic, which is it's mortally wounded,
it is sinking, but before it goes under,
really when things get really bad, the bow has sunk,
but the stern is rising up actually quite high in the air.
And that's sort of an analogy as you were saying,
which is when everybody flees from all the other currencies
into the dollar at the very end,
the dollar looks like it's doing great
on a relative basis at least.
And that's obviously right before the whole thing slips
under the ocean waterline.
So anyways, curious to hear your thoughts
on those analogies.
- Yeah, I think that's exactly how it works
to a lot of people.
There are basically two ways
to discuss the strength of a currency.
One is relative to other currencies.
And that's the one that the mainstream media
and a lot of economists use.
And by that measure, the dollar looks pretty good
because the other currencies are even more badly run
and the other countries are even closer to that debt wall
that we're all headed for.
The dollar looks relatively stable.
But the other way to measure a currency is like you said,
versus gold, which is real money or versus purchasing power.
In other words, what can you buy with it?
And by that measure,
all the big currencies are declining at varying rates,
but also at accelerating rates.
If you take the past five years
versus the previous five years, it was faster.
And there's no reason to think that the next decade or so
won't be an acceleration.
Although I think it's a decent chance
that we have a deflationary year or two in there
when the economy slows way down
and the price of a lot of things fall.
So we could actually see some fiat currencies rise
in terms of purchasing power in the short run.
But the central bank's reaction to that will,
as we talked about, have to be so inflationary
that two years of slight deflation
will evaporate in a heartbeat
when next generation QE kicks in.
So yeah, but what's going on in the rest of the world,
for instance, geopolitically,
might end up being way more important
than this finance stuff,
because let the US be pulled into a war with Iran.
And it's the US and Israel against Iran
and maybe Russia or something like that,
which is completely conceivable
given the people we have in charge of the US right now
who would actually kind of like that.
I mean, I think there's, I wouldn't say a consensus,
but I think there's a strong strain of opinion
within US leadership
that using Israel as a proxy army to go after Iran
would be just as smart as using Ukraine
as a proxy army to go after Russia.
And that cost a lot of dead Ukrainians,
but it soaked up a lot of Russian military spending
and killed a lot of Russian soldiers.
And they're basically happy with that outcome.
So let those guys try to pull the same thing
in the Middle East and all bets are off.
You know, that cheap energy pieces, forget it.
Oil is $200 a barrel while that's going on.
And you know, it's not clear what those new weapons do.
I mean, when we start throwing AI-driven hypersonic drones
at each other, there's no way to predict
what that's gonna turn out to be.
And so that could be vastly more destabilizing
for the world than 11 and a half percent inflation
in 2025 or something like that.
So I think the finance thing is clearly a crisis
baked into the cake and waiting to happen,
but it could be preempted by some other stuff.
And then, you know, you get,
what does AI do to the job market?
We don't know, but we know it could be pretty serious
and it could be a short-term thing as these things accelerate.
So there's a lot of things like that out there
that are harder to predict
and are kind of arbitrary in that sense,
but are things that you need to keep track of
if you're trying to decide what to do with your money,
because those things will definitely affect your investments.
So we've got a very chaotic world coming
and not just for financial reasons.
I mean, not just for geopolitical reasons,
but all those reasons combined.
- So, and there are a few other ones
I'm gonna throw on the fire here too in a second,
but I go back to your comment at the beginning
that I think it was a good way to sort of sum up your view,
which is not a lot of ways
for a better than expected outcome to come out of this,
but a lot of potential ways
for a worse than expected outcome to come out of this.
So I sort of see you saying,
look, on the financial side of things,
the economic side of things, it's really just math
and the math makes you pessimistic,
but there are these black swans or maybe gray swans,
'cause we can kind of see where the risk could come from.
That could pop up along the way
that could just upset the apple cart a lot faster,
a lot more violently and a lot sooner.
- Yes, lots of things can happen
that we're not necessarily plugged into.
I mean, we know the Middle East is a mess
and the Russia Ukraine thing is by no means settled.
We know those things,
but we don't know what the next level
of something like that could be.
At least emotionally, we don't know it.
You can say intellectually
that a broader Middle East war is a bad thing,
but the reality of it would be nightmarish
if it really got going.
Oh, and we can't forget China and Taiwan.
We actually have people in the US government
who think it would be an excellent idea
to preemptively stop China from trying to take over Taiwan.
In other words, take out a bunch of their naval capability,
because China is a threat in the future.
We might as well take them out now while we can.
And there are people who believe that
and some of them are in positions of power
and some of them no matter who gets elected next time around
some of them will be in positions of power again.
And so that's the kind of thing that
we're just one bad policy or one mistake
on the part of a fighter pilot or a Navy captain
or something like that from something much more serious.
- All right, and look,
I'm not trying to freak people out here,
but this is a good exploration
of all the risk spectrum here.
And so one of the things I have on my list here
to ask you about is you need to say we're one bad policy,
one bad decision away from some pretty scary things.
There is definitely, I think, an increasing loss of faith
in our leadership and our institutions.
And we can certainly say a lot of it's probably justified.
But everything from
distrust in the federal reserves response
and everything from waiting too long
to tackle "transitory inflation" to did the Fed
and Congress, were they too excessive
in all the pandemic response that then distorted everything
and exacerbated the wealth gap
and then got us 9% inflation and all this stuff, right?
So I would say that there's a lot of earned skepticism
on the financial side of things,
but then you have things like what's going on right now
with the major college presidents
that were called in front of Congress, right?
And then the whole plagiarism issue with Harvard
and whatnot, you have some long-term institutions
really long held up as the best and brightest
of what America had to offer
that are now getting punished and damaged reputationally
in a way that's gonna linger for a good long period of time
and is changing behavior.
Applications to Harvard this year were down
more than they've ever been down before.
In fact, they rarely ever go down.
Then on the political side of things as well,
it's already a pretty mosh pit-like environment
in the presidential campaign.
But we have things like the secretary of defense
who we just realized is basically a hospitalized
and incapacitated and we finding out
that the White House didn't even know about this, right?
So we have the SEC that its Twitter account
just got hacked yesterday, right?
That announced that, oh, we've approved the Bitcoin ETF.
And then of course, Gary Gensler had to quickly retweet,
nope, nope, nope, we got hacked, ignore that, right?
So there's this increasing sense of either like,
my gosh, we're just run by clowns
or we just don't trust the folks
that are leading our top institutions
to be making the right decisions.
So that's gotta have some corrosive element in here
where, as you said, the cost of making a bad choice
is increasingly getting high,
but also the faith in the system is eroding at the same time
and it just sounds like a very dangerous cocktail to me.
- Yeah, the peasants are losing faith in the aristocracy.
And in some cases, it's because the aristocracy
is a bunch of evil geniuses and in other cases,
it's because they're a bunch of inept morons.
So take your choice, you have examples of both out there.
But what's clear and I think what's becoming clearer
to people with time is that most major policies
are designed, not as a bug, but as a feature,
to enrich the already rich and impoverish everybody else.
And you look at banking and monetary policy,
every time the banks cause a big crisis,
the government steps in and bails out the banks
so the bankers don't lose any money.
Then it lowers interest rates dramatically,
which makes stocks, bonds, and real estate,
financial assets go up in value,
which enriches the guys who own them,
who are already rich.
And it makes the interest paid on bank CDs,
which is the saving vehicle of the rabble, go down.
So it's harder to live in retirement
and harder to get yourself to retirement.
So, you know, that's an obvious set of policies
that are designed to help the aristocracy.
And then same thing with military policy.
You know, we stomp around the world starting wars
and funding proxy wars and things like that.
Well, who benefits from that?
The arms makers fund both sides in a lot of these wars,
and then they get very rich, and then they turn around
and they finance the political campaigns
of the war hawk, neocon politicians out there.
So it's this closed loop of money taken from taxpayers
and enriches that whole sector of the economy
and the political system.
And then, you know, pandemic response.
You know, I'll put my tinfoil hat on here
and tell the whole story.
We fund the creation of a dangerous virus.
It gets out.
We immediately lock down the global economy,
which enriches a bunch of e-commerce companies
and impoverishes all the small businesses out there.
And then we mandate that everybody take the vaccine,
which sends hundreds of billions of dollars
to the pharmaceutical companies making the vaccines,
who then turn around and finance the political campaigns
of a different group of politicians,
or maybe the same group of politicians.
People are starting to see that that's how it works.
And so they don't trust the guys in charge anymore.
And, you know, that feeds into trust
in all the other systems, one of which is money.
So that takes us back to the investment thesis,
that people lose faith in the guys running the currency.
A fiat currency only exists because we have faith
in the guys running the currency.
And that leads us to a currency crisis.
So everything that we see happening out there
leads back to the imperative
to get your finances out of the system.
Oh, and then there's this thing called the great taking
that is getting a lot of press lately,
which we can come back to that in a minute
after I've finished completing the investment thesis thing.
But get your money out of the financial system
and get it into real assets, you know?
If you could buy farmland, you know, Bill Gates,
richest guy in the world,
is now the biggest owner of farmland in the world.
Why is that?
There's a reason for it
and you should be following his example.
If you can have land that grows food,
you're halfway to being okay for what's coming.
And it goes on and on.
But, you know, it's a thesis your listeners
have definitely heard of before,
but it's becoming more imperative all the time.
- All right, so the reason I bring up this sort of risk
of a social crisis or uprising,
I feel like I'm bringing it up more and more
on these conversations,
because my concern is I agree with the trajectory
of what you're saying, you know,
which is we are squeezing the middle class more and more
in this country.
It really is bifurcating into an economy
of a small number at the top
who are getting an increasing amount
of the harvest of the economy.
And then everybody else who is, you know,
feeling like their prospects are just being diminished away
at this just inexorable grind, right?
And I think coming out of the pandemic,
that's become increasingly clear for people
as they've just seen cost of living
just skyrocket in a number of essentials.
There's just no way for them to escape that, right?
So I guess my question here on this, John,
is just like, you know, when I look forward,
I do worry that I don't see a really clear path
where things get materially better over the next decade
or several decades for the average person.
I don't see a lot of these trends
that are pressuring against them going into reverse
on any timeline that makes me feel comfortable.
So do you worry about some sort of social breaking point
where enough people just say,
this thing's just not working for me
and you start getting more drastic responses
from the populace?
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, you know, as Gerald Cilente likes to say,
when people have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
So civil unrest is just a part of gigantic financial crises.
It's a normal part of the process.
And then you get leadership change, obviously, you know,
and what's happening in the US
or really around the world now
is you're seeing populist politicians
getting a better and better response
because populism is not a political philosophy
like communism or capitalism or something like that.
It's basically an attitude where the politician says,
look, we know you're being screwed over
by these rich guys over here, so you put me in office.
I'll go over there and get back what's been stolen from you.
And, you know, the policies that flow from that
are all over the place,
but it's the attitude that sells really well
in a political environment
where people are getting more and more disgusted
and less and less trustful of the establishment.
So we're gonna see that going forward for sure.
I mean, Trump obviously is a manifestation for that.
He's not, you know, if you don't like Trump,
you should see that he's not the problem.
He's a symptom of the problem.
And if you do like Trump, then okay, good luck.
Hopefully he begins the process
of getting you back what's been stolen from you.
But the vague Ramaswami in the US
has come up with some brilliant rhetoric
around the populist theme
that I think, you know, is there to be stolen
by all the other politicians.
You're gonna see people around the world
saying stuff like that because it's so well done.
And it's gonna work, you know.
In Germany, what they call far right
but is actually just a populace.
The far right party over there
is now arguably the most powerful political party
in the country.
It's gonna have a chance to form a government
one of these days.
In the Netherlands, same thing just happened
where the far right party is forming a government.
France, Marine Le Pen might finally
get to be president there.
So we're seeing the, you know,
the peasants with the pitchfork thing
play out on the political stage.
And if that works, then that's as far as it'll go.
We'll get some policies that start the process of,
you know, we'll fix things anytime soon.
You can't get rid of this much debt
without incredible pain.
But if you've got policies in place
that are at least obviously aimed at helping
the bottom 50% of the economy
instead of harvesting the bottom 50%,
then, you know, you have a chance of getting through it
without massive civil unrest.
But massive is the key word.
There will be a lot of civil unrest
as this thing goes along.
And a lot of it's gonna be, you know, shocking, right?
We're a very well-armed country here.
So it's completely possible that you're gonna see
people, well-armed people on the right
fighting well-armed people on the left
in American streets, you know, and hopefully not.
But it's a completely, you know,
when you look at the number of guns per capita
and look at how angry so many people are,
'cause, well, let's go back to the people
that we were talking about
who were putting their lives on credit cards.
'Cause what happened to them was
they were just getting by, a lot of them.
And then the pandemic hits and the lockdowns
and all the new currency creation and inflation spikes.
And so basically their day-to-day life
got 30% more expensive because of government policy.
And now they are literally having to decide,
you know, who doesn't eat, you know,
or who doesn't get to drive to work.
Well, those are gonna be really angry people
unless clear policies are put in place that help them.
And, you know, you could go back to the stimmy check thing
and just say, okay, you get $500 a month going forward
in an open-ended way, and people will at least,
you know, that'll put gas in the car.
So that will at least be seen
as the government actually helping people
instead of bailing out JPMorgan Chase
so they can pay record bonuses
to their investment bankers at the end of that year.
You know, that's the kind of thing that gets you riots.
But ongoing financial help of some sort
is the thing that limits rights.
So it could be that it has to be something like that,
which, you know, as a libertarian,
I don't like the idea of
continuous government payments to people,
but I think as a stopgap measure
to keep us just from spinning into complete chaos,
that might be something that is a tool that actually works.
We'll have to see.
But that's gonna be the debate going forward is how,
you know, how do we keep people
from just burning down the State House?
And there needs to be policies in place that do that.
So it'll be an interesting debate with,
you know, it's a tough one for people
from pretty much any part of the political spectrum
because it violates a lot of the basically bedrock truths.
You know, as a libertarian, I'm saying,
yeah, maybe we need UBI.
Maybe we need, you know, universal basic income for a while.
And that's something that, you know,
a libertarian would never say that,
but here I am saying it.
So it's gonna be a confusing political time.
- Well, you know, is,
you're familiar with Neil Howe's sort of fourth turning,
you know, if we're indeed in one,
and it seems like for sure
we're seeing a lot of the signs that we are,
those are just characterized by upheaval, right?
And sometimes that upheaval makes really strange bedfellows.
You know, let's all cross our fingers
and hope we avoid some of the worst
of what you're thinking potentially could happen here.
But John, it sounds like it's safe to say
you expect that going forward
for the foreseeable future at least,
we're gonna see populism on the rise, not the wane, correct?
- Oh yeah, there's no way to avoid that
because populism is what happens
when people are impoverished.
And debt impoverishes you.
That's just what it does
because you get the money now and you spend it,
and then you gotta pay the interest going forward.
So you're less well off going forward
than you would be otherwise
if you didn't have to pay the interest.
Well, all of society is in that spot right now.
So we get poorer without a doubt going forward.
And it becomes a question of
how do you allocate that regression?
In other words, you know,
most of us are gonna move backwards to an extent,
but who moves backwards 70% and who moves backwards 5%.
So that'll be the political debate going forward.
And see, that's the opposite
of the past 70-year political debate
when it was basically who's gonna get how much?
Nobody's gonna get less, but everybody's gonna get more.
- Right, when the pie is growing,
it's super easy to legislate.
Yeah, exactly.
- And see, this generation of politicians
have never had to do that.
They don't have the faintest idea
how to say no to an important constituency,
but all they're gonna be doing is saying no going forward.
It's just the magnitude of the no, right?
You know, if it's a really big tax increase, let's say,
that's gonna be baffling to them.
How do you sell, for instance,
a tax on high-frequency trading to Wall Street,
who has been funding your campaign for the last 30 years?
You're gonna go to them and say,
okay, you're gonna make 100 billion less dollars a year
because of this tax, but I need to do it.
You know, I can't stay in office without doing it.
Please let me do it.
They're gonna say, you know, for sure, fine, whatever.
And then they'll hire an assassin
to kill you or something, you know?
So, and you'll know that as a politician.
That's probably what's gonna happen to you.
So that's gonna be the debate.
And there's no way around it when you borrow too much money,
whether you're an individual or a family or a country,
excessive debt makes you poorer.
That's just all there is to it.
And so we're, you know, we're coming into a time
when people already don't trust the government.
And a good government has to tell people explicitly
that they're gonna get poorer going forward.
So it's not clear how that works.
And, you know, I don't have a good answer.
I don't think I could really sit down
and write out a paragraph that sells this
to people at a town hall meeting or anything.
I just think it's gonna be incredibly messy.
- Politically, yeah.
It's politically just, it's a Gordian knot,
but needs to happen obviously, but probably won't.
All right, so I wanna get to the part of the conversation,
John, where we're bringing people back off the ledge, right?
And saying, hey, you know, at least for you
at the individual level, there's agency here.
There's ways to protect yourself
from stuff we're talking about.
Maybe even ways to even have still a great future,
even if some of this stuff happens, you know,
to the vast majority of the world.
Real quick though, two things.
One, I wanna give you a chance to make your comments
on the great taking,
'cause I've had a lot of comments to address it.
And I have not had a chance to address it in a video yet.
So if you could at least, you know,
put your finger on that for folks, I'd appreciate it.
Real quick before I do that,
I just wanna give you prompts to the point you just made.
This was something you said long time ago.
I might wanna say 10 years ago or so.
I remember you in your writings saying that in many ways,
given the challenges we're gonna have to face going forward,
we have the exact wrong talent base in our government,
where we have, you know,
now it's clear to everybody that we have a gerontocracy,
that we have these people that have just been in politics
forever and they don't wanna give up their grip
of the reins of power, right?
But all those people have built their career
with a rising tide, right?
As you said, in terms of, you know, prosperity to spend.
Now that we're getting into a contractionary phase,
these people just don't have the musculature.
They've never had to develop it.
So you can make the argument that they're actually
the exact wrong people you want running the system
in this type of environment.
So I just wanna give you kudos for calling that,
you know, a long time ago.
And now we're actually beginning
to see direct evidence of that.
Okay, to "The Great Taking,"
can't make the whole video about it,
but what do you think is important to note here for folks?
- Yeah, "The Great Taking" is a book and a documentary
that came out just lately and has been getting, you know,
a ton of attention, especially in the sound money space.
You know, people who think that hard times are coming
absolutely by the ideas
in "The Great Taking" book and documentary.
And you know, the central thesis is that securities laws
have been secretly changed over the past decade
so that we don't actually own our bank accounts
and our brokerage accounts.
So our stocks and bonds and our cash, basically,
aren't really ours.
They belong to the financial system.
And in the next crisis where,
'cause obviously a crisis is coming
because the collateral that's out there
is nowhere near nearly adequate
for the amount of debt that's against that collateral,
our brokerage accounts in particular
are basically just gonna be confiscated.
We're gonna get zero from that part of our savings.
Now, I'm not a securities law expert,
and so I'm not qualified to judge that argument,
but a lot of people have been looking at the thesis
and coming back and saying, yeah, that's right.
You know, a lot of people with some expertise.
So, you know, if that's true,
then it perfectly fits the story
that you and I have been telling your audience
for the last hour, right?
That the people in charge are harvesting the peasants
and they're set up for an even big cathartic harvesting
where they basically just take everything.
You know, they've been taking a little bit at a time
for the past few decades.
And now in one fell swoop, they're just gonna take it all.
And again, I, you know, can't judge the argument,
but some other people have and say it's real.
And if it's true, then it's totally keeping in character
with what we know about the guys in charge right now.
And you know, you wanna think about civil unrest,
let that happen, see what happens.
- Yeah, so I haven't watched the documentary
or read the book yet, but just a reminder for folks,
I have been super heads down cramming for the security exam.
So when I'm not filming these videos,
I'm pretty much doing that.
Assuming for a second were that to happen.
I mean, to me, I just don't know
how you don't go instantaneously to the torches
and pitchforks overnight, especially this time round,
'cause you're really declaring war
on the people with resources, or at least who have them
until you've stole them from them.
And those are people that actually have, you know,
certain degree of influence and ability to mobilize.
I just don't know how you wouldn't go to like a Sri Lankan,
you know, millions show up at the presidential palace
and just forcibly drag the president out.
Like, I don't know how you wouldn't get to a state like that
real quick if the vast majority of Americans
who had assets got a note the next day that said,
oops, sorry, it's all gone.
- Can you imagine what the baby boomers would do?
- Yeah, I don't know, maybe they'll take it
from the boomers first because they'll wait
until the boomers are old enough where they're like,
hey, you know, we're not too worried
about a bunch of 80-year-olds, right?
- Hey, Adam, we are never gonna be too old
to shoot our AK-47s, okay?
Well, we'll be in our wheelchairs out there
firing automatic weapons at the governor's mansion
or at the Fed headquarters or something,
'cause, you know, we've had basically charmed lives.
You know, the baby boomers grew up in the best time
for jobs, the best time for investing,
the best time to be a homeowner, you know?
And nobody's taken that away from us.
So unless, here's a scenario where,
let's say another pandemic comes along,
they lock us all down, they pass gun control laws,
they go to our houses, take the guns away,
then the great taking happens, okay?
So that's a scenario where at least
they would have a chance of succeeding,
where it wouldn't be civil war, you know?
But I don't think you can just do it
with everybody as they are today,
'cause we will presumably hit the streets.
And you know, the other part of this is
the police that would be expected
to control that kind of civil unrest
are basically of the 50%, right?
You know, their friends and family
are the ones who are being impoverished
and the ones who are having their guns confiscated.
So it's not clear that the National Guard and the ATF
and even the FBI would be on the government side
in a situation like that.
So then you get into the really intense
kind of civil unrest where the government
doesn't trust the army anymore.
So I don't know.
You know, I'm just spinning scenarios here
where there's no answer to any of it,
but it's all completely conceivable,
one thing following from the other.
- Well, thanks for demystifying the great taking.
But yeah, to me, it's like, if that happens,
then we have just fallen off the cliff into totalitarianism
and you know, Jesus, let's see what would happen then.
Not saying it can't happen, but God, would it be terrible.
All right, well, look, like I said,
I want to try to walk people off the ledge here
and say, hey, look, you know, John,
I don't consider you a gloom and doomer guy
who just says we're all screwed
and there's nothing we can do about it.
I know that there's a lot you think people can do
in terms of how to position with their money.
I know that there's a lot that you think people can do
positioning with their homestead
and their lifestyle and things like that.
So let's tackle the money part first, maybe two questions.
One is what kind of market outlook do you have for 2024?
And secondly, what type of assets
do you favor in this environment?
- Yeah, I think 2024 is probably a bear market
just because you get a recession
or even a little bit of a downturn
with stocks as expensive as they are.
You know, the S&P 500 is in one of those ranges
where in the historical past,
whenever it gets this richly valued,
there's a crash afterwards.
So it's valued that way.
The economy is slowing down,
corporate profits are gonna go down.
Equities bear market is the most obvious thing
in the world there.
So stocks probably tank.
Now, the question is what happens to commodities
in that kind of an environment?
Because commodities are super cheap relative to stocks.
So you would think they would outperform stocks.
But in a recession, commodities frequently fall too.
So you could get an equities bear market
that pulls down gold, silver, copper.
It's hard to see anything pulling down uranium at this point
'cause uranium exists as a kind of a separate story
out there that's almost immune to the business cycle.
But the rest of the commodity complex is at risk
in a deflationary recession.
But I think much less of a risk
because it's already cheap relative to stocks.
So stocks could fall a long way
just to get to the point where they're fairly valued
versus commodities, the commodities don't move at all.
And so I think gold and silver are good things to own.
If you don't already own them,
you should be dollar cost averaging into them
because we shouldn't necessarily be looking
at the first order effects here.
The economy slows down, stocks tank, then what?
That's the thing you should be aiming at.
And the Fed is gonna panic.
It'll jump in, it'll start easing again,
start cutting interest rates back down towards zero
and maybe even negative.
And that is a phenomenally good environment
for other forms of money like gold and silver,
but also for commodities.
Because for instance, the copper story
is very good fundamentally.
We don't have enough copper to electrify the world,
but we've decided we're gonna electrify the world.
So copper is gonna be in very tight supply
and probably in a rising price environment for a long time.
After whatever happens in 2024.
So look at things like that.
The right kind of real estate will do very well.
So in other words, governments can't just inflate away.
So be paying attention to stuff like that.
'Cause this is potentially one of the life-changing markets
for people who get this right.
So now we're in the positive part of this.
It took a long while to get to the optimistic part of this,
but the crises that might be coming
will create opportunities that are commensurately huge.
Watch the movie, "The Big Short."
A handful of hedge fund guys understood
that housing was gonna tank and they placed bets
that were too early on that.
And they lost a lot of money for a while,
but then it worked out and they made fortunes.
Life-changing money.
One guy made $20 billion from those kinds of bets.
Well, that's coming.
So what do we wanna do?
I think that the kind of shorting
that they did during "The Big Short" might work again,
because if equities are overvalued
and we're heading into a recession,
which will lead to a bear market,
then learning how to short certain stocks
is probably a good thing to learn how to do.
You could probably just use hood options
on the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ,
which are very liquid easy bets to place
as your big short analog.
Just buy those things.
And buy longer term,
so you have a couple of years for it to work out.
And you probably have a chance at a 10-bagger
in options like that,
depending on what kinds of options you buy exactly.
But you have a potentially big winter there
just because the market is set up so perfectly
for that kind of a bet.
And gold and silver miners and copper miners actually,
and uranium miners.
The mining stocks in the commodity space
have not done nearly as well as the metals in a lot of cases.
So they're cheap relative to the underlying metals.
And we're entering a time when the fundamentals
might not be bad for the miners because oil prices,
which we haven't talked about yet, have gone down lately.
And it's possible for some technical
and technological reasons that oil doesn't just soar again,
that it stays kind of at these levels or a little bit lower.
That's good for miners because they use a lot of energy
in order to get things out of the ground.
Well, you cut the price of their energy
and their margins widen.
So for instance, a gold miner might see
the price of gold going up
while the cost of energy goes down
and they get these really wide margins
with lots of good cash flow and stuff like that.
And all of a sudden they're Wall Street darlings.
That could easily happen to the gold and silver miners.
So the best of them might be five baggers
and the little lottery ticket type companies in that space
could be 10 baggers.
You don't need many 10 baggers
to completely change your financial life.
And the point of this is that having a few of those
gives you the capital to protect yourself and your family
when things get really crazy out there.
So these bets aren't just because we want to get rich,
they're because we want to be able to protect our loved ones.
And the more capital you have,
the better able you are to do that.
So there's both a personal greed aspect to this
and an altruistic aspect to it.
So whatever makes you more comfortable
and energizes you more when you're looking into this stuff.
- All right.
Well, really well said.
And I'm glad that we're here at the point
of some optimism here in the story.
I want to note two things.
One, folks, if you're not experienced with shorting,
if you're not experienced with owning mining stocks,
which are highly volatile and, you know,
most of the time, I'll say at least over the past decade,
you know, have been much more widow makers
than they've been profit makers.
To John's point, in the right conditions,
they can be ferociously,
they can appreciate ferociously.
So no doubt they can't be a great path to great returns.
But I just want to say,
if you're not experienced in investing in them,
highly, highly recommend if you choose,
you decide you want to start getting some experience,
you do so under the guidance
of a professional financial advisor
who is experienced in them and can help guide you
both in terms of positions to actually take
and which stocks to buy,
but also just what makes sense for you in your portfolio,
given your own personal situation needs, risk tolerance,
all that type of stuff.
Now, if you're looking for ideas on specific,
you know, stocks to look, companies to look at,
stocks to buy, et cetera,
John, I believe you actually share a lot of stock picks
with the companies that you track through your sub stack.
Is that true?
- Yeah, that sub stack has a portfolio
that I've created of gold and silver miners
and the junior miners in that space
and uranium miners and some short candidates,
things like that.
And the deal is that I have to open every position
that I recommend on the sub stack.
So we're all in it together for better or worse.
- Like it, you've got skin in the game.
Do you mind showing a little leg here
and just sharing the names of one, two or three companies
that you particularly like right now?
And then of course, if folks want to learn the full list,
they can go to your sub stack.
- Sure, well, the uranium story is so great
that it bears some expansion.
Basically, a lot of the countries in the world
decided that nuclear power is bad
and they closed down a bunch of nuclear plants
and took a lot of the other ones
that were in the pipeline out of the pipeline.
And so demand for uranium, which runs nuclear plants,
went down and the uranium miners stocks went down
and everything.
But lately in the last couple of years,
uranium has come back into style.
Nuclear plants are opening again.
Countries are realizing that they can't get by
just on solar and wind,
but they don't want to restart their coal plants or anything.
So they're building a lot of new new plants.
China in particular has this massive pipeline
of nuclear plants and there's nowhere near enough uranium
coming out of today's mines
to feed all of these new nuclear plants coming online.
So what that means is the price of uranium has to go up
in order to incent new miners to come along
and supply the new nuclear plants.
Well, in that kind of a situation,
you can start with the big names in a space
and as people, first of all,
stop hating the industry and then start liking it,
the big guys, even though they're reasonably well known,
have a great run.
So one of the biggest winners in my substack portfolio
is Cameco, which is the bigger,
sort of the Exxon of uranium.
And it's got a lot of different divisions
doing different things in that space
and it mines a lot of uranium.
And it's almost doubled in the past year
without actually making all that much more money.
Uranium, the price of it has been going up,
but not necessarily enough to account
for the stock prices in that space are going up
and people are moving into that space.
So a good portfolio of uranium companies
is probably an excellent thing to own going forward.
In the gold and silver miners,
there are these things called royalty companies
that basically don't actually go out and mine gold and silver
with all the risks that involve.
They finance emerging mines on really favorable terms
'cause it's hard to finance emerging gold and silver mines.
So the guys who can do it get very good deals.
And so they basically build themselves
streams of gold and silver coming in
at very favorable prices.
So when gold and silver prices go up,
the royalty companies generate massive cashflow.
So if you just don't own the royalty companies,
that's almost all you have to do in gold and silver.
There are a lot of other interesting plays out there,
but some uranium stocks
and high quality royalty companies in gold and silver.
- And sorry, just to push for the showing of leg here,
is there a streamer that you would particularly encourage
folks to look at right now?
- Okay, there's one I just mentioned that I like.
It's a medium sized one called,
oh my God, am I gonna forget the name here?
That would be terrible.
Sandstorm, yeah, Sandstorm.
Yeah, and basically what they did
was they're a royalty company.
So they went out and they bought their future growth
for the next five or so years.
They borrowed a lot of money to do it.
And so they bought some potentially very profitable
royalty streams by buying another company
and by buying some royalty streams individually.
And so now they've got quite a bit of debt,
which is weighing down their stock price.
But at the same time,
the royalty streams they bought are working out nicely.
So that right now they've got a margin,
which is the difference between what they pay
for their gold and silver ounces coming in
and what they can sell those gold and silver ounces at
of like $1,700.
They make $1,700 per ounce of gold right now.
And that's giving them cashflow
that they can use to pay off their-
- To beat down that debt.
- Yeah, yeah, and so if debt is the problem
and they're gonna be,
every quarter they're gonna be coming out and going,
okay, we took out another $40 million of debt
with all this cash that we're generating.
They're gonna solve that problem very publicly
and the stock price could rise dramatically.
'Cause once the debt's gone,
they've got all this cashflow
coming in with nowhere to put it.
So they'll buy back stock and they'll pay dividends.
And it's potentially just a really good story.
There are other stories out there like Sandstorm,
but that's one of the interesting ones.
But a portfolio of five comparable royalty companies
ought to do just great in the next 10 years.
It ought to be,
even though they're well-known companies to an extent,
they could easily be five baggers in the aggregate
where you make five times your money
without a ton of risk because they're not super risky
compared to, for instance, a straight up gold miner.
- All right, well, look, I gotta wrap things up here, John.
Again, I love your partnership just on our private talks
in this public one as well.
Like our private talks,
I could go for another couple of hours here,
but I have to wind it down.
I'm at the point where I asked the question,
where can folks go who have enjoyed this conversation?
Where can they go to learn more about you and your work?
I presume your substack is the best place for them to go.
- Yeah, that's it for me.
I'm at rubino.substack.com,
and it's a newsletter that's basically aimed
at actionable ideas for getting through the next decade.
And it's not just financial,
although it does have a lot
of stock market related stuff in it,
but it's a lot of lifestyle stuff too.
- Okay, great.
Well, look, John, when I edit this,
I'll put the link to your substack right up there
prominently on the screen.
I'll also put it in the description below this video, folks.
So folks, if you just want one-click access,
just look below the video here and you'll find the link.
All right, well, look,
I've got one more question for you, John,
which I'll ask you in about a minute
so you can think about it while I do some housekeeping.
We've been talking a lot about, well, a ton of things,
but we focus largely on the financial aspect.
In terms of a positive, constructive investment
that someone can make in their life
that's not money-related, what would you suggest?
All right, so while you're thinking about that,
real quick, folks, just three updates
and you want to stick around to hear these.
The first is obviously,
if you'd like this conversation with John,
we'd like to have him come back on again,
perhaps in the second quarter to give us an update
on how he's seeing the world,
please let him know by hitting the like button,
then clicking on the red subscribe button below.
So what was that little bell icon right next to it?
Secondly, I've been talking about the fact
that Thoughtful Money is going to be having a conference
in March.
We've finally locked the date down.
It's going to be Saturday, March 16th.
I just got Lacy Hunt.
I got his confirmation
that he will keynote this conference as well.
For those of you who have watched my previous conferences
where Lacy has keynoted, you know how special that is.
I'm super excited for that to happen.
More details will be coming out soon
about how you can register for it, sign up for it, et cetera.
I'm still finalizing the details,
which is why I don't have a URL to give you just yet,
but just mark your mental calendars
for March 16th and more to come.
Last, I just want to remind folks about my sub stack.
I publish a lot of information there for free
during the week about everything going on at Thoughtful Money.
There is a premium service there as well,
where you get my Adam's notes,
my detailed cliff notes summaries of all these interviews,
including this one here with John.
But in addition to that and some of the other things
that you get for the premium subscription,
an important one that you also get is discounts
to Thoughtful Money events like this upcoming conference.
So again, I'll be sharing all the pricing
as soon as I get everything locked down,
but just to let folks know,
especially if you're already a premium subscriber,
we do everything we can to get people
the best value for the conference.
So we'll have an early bird price
that'll be out there for a generous period of time
where folks can save a healthy discount,
something in the order of magnitude of 30% or greater
on the full ticket price.
But if you act, well, at any point in time,
but especially if you act at the early bird point in time
and you're a premium subscriber to the sub stack,
you will get an additional attractive discount
on top of that.
So think of this premium subscription
as almost like a discount card, like you get at Costco
for anything that Thoughtful Money does from an event
or product standpoint going forward.
All right, John, we're now here at the end.
What is a good non-money related investment
that you would encourage folks to consider adopting?
- Well, Adam, there's this thing called skill stacking
that is in career counseling.
And the idea is that if you add,
you don't have to be great at a bunch of things,
but if you add a few skills to your repertoire,
it makes you a lot more valuable in the job market.
For example, if you're pretty good at something,
but then you become good as a public speaker,
you automatically become more valuable as an employee.
You have a chance of becoming the boss
instead of the employee going forward,
if you can stand up in front of a crowd
and get your point across.
Well, that's absolutely true.
You should be acquiring skills like that
if you want your career to be more successful.
But that also works in the whole prepping kind of thing
that you and I talked about where there's a lot of things
we're gonna need to be able to do going forward,
a lot of challenges.
And the better able we are to meet those challenges,
the more likely we are to be successful
in surviving and thriving in what's coming.
And so examples of that would be,
can you grow your own food?
And a lot of people have the idea that,
oh, well, if things get tight, I'll just put in a garden.
Well, there's more to it than that.
- That's a big learning curve.
- Yes, there is.
And so go up that learning curve now,
become somebody who's capable of supplying
20% of your family's food.
That's a huge deal.
Same thing with doing drywall, doing car repair,
doing electrical related things,
learning to be proficient and safe with firearms,
learning to physically defend yourself.
There are all these things that might come in handy later
in scenarios that you can easily envision.
The more of those things you stack onto your persona,
the better able you are to get you and your friends
through probable hard times that are coming.
And you don't have to be great in any one of them.
You just have to be slightly proficient.
If you're just reasonably good at five or six new things
over the next few years,
then you've given yourself a much better chance
of coming through the next few years in great shape.
You know, and you can begin wherever you are
with whatever you're interested in.
There are classes out there on Udemy
or on YouTube, places like that,
where you can begin acquiring skills with very little cost,
very little effort, and you just go from there.
- Right, or in your local community,
where in addition to learning the skills,
you're also building community at the same time, right?
Period in relationships.
- So very well said, John, as you know,
especially from my past businesses I've been involved in,
huge fan and advocate and proponent for resilience,
which is really what you're talking about here,
increasing your self-reliance.
So wholeheartedly support everything you mentioned there.
I just want to underscore one element,
which is you want to break it down
into the learning curve
for the cost of actually developing the skill.
And then you also want to look at it
from a scalability standpoint.
And in general, with these types of skills,
much easier to scale them
once you've come up the learning curve
on how to do it initially.
And gardening's a great example, right?
To go from having no experience
to growing 5% of your calories,
really, really hard, takes a long time.
But once you know how to grow 5% of your calories,
to increase that to growing 20% of your calories,
pretty easy to do.
You just scale it,
the things that you already know how to do.
So it's one of these things like in the mining sector,
I hear a lot of people say,
well, it's going to take off at some point.
So you want to get positioned in an early
before it takes off.
The time you want to invest in learning these skills
is when the sun's still shining
and everything's still fine.
Use that time to get up the learning curve.
And then only if you need to worry
about the scaling things up,
if conditions demand you do so,
because that's the easier part.
- Well done, Adam.
Nicely said.
- All right.
Well, thanks my friend.
We'll wind it down here for folks
that still have any stamina left
and are hungry for continued discussion like this.
I just want to flag the interview that I did
earlier this week with Jim Carson.
Great discussion.
We don't get into quite this territory, John,
but a lot of what he talks about
in terms of the framework for how he sees
the global economy and markets working
over the next couple of decades
does plug a lot into what you were saying here.
So folks, if you'd be interested in watching that,
I'll put up a link to it here.
John, it's always wonderful having you on the program.
My friend, thanks so much for coming on.
Everybody else, thanks so much for watching.
