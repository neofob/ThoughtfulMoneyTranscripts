### Summary

1. The global economy is weak, with Europe stagnating or in recession and
China struggling with secular structural issues. The US is the only spot
still doing well, but Felix Zulauf expects it to be weaker than it turned
out. He expected a recovery in stock markets from last fall's lows to be
temporary and thinks the Fed made a mistake by easing too much.

2. Felix Zulauf predicts that 2024 could see an important new high and an
important new low in the market, similar to what happened in 2020, 2018,
and 2022. He thinks this will be due to a mini bull cycle caused by the Fed
adding too much liquidity, which will peak in Q1 of 2024 before turning into
a weak economy because declining asset prices hurt consumers.

3. The market risk is concentrated in the "magnificent seven" stocks (FAANG),
which are overvalued and have a historic concentration of assets in equity
portfolios. If the market begins to correct and decline, these stocks could
magnify the decline and exaggerate it due to their heavy concentration in
portfolio holdings.

4. Felix Zulauf plans on positioning for this by remaining light long up
until end of Q1, where he will then start loading on his short positions
in anticipation of a pretty extreme fall. He sees big opportunities if we
hit somewhere around 3000 S&P and expects it to be 6000 within a year or
two. Commodities could perform even better, especially commodity-related
companies.

5. Felix Zulauf is not as bearish on the dollar as the consensus, which
predicts a weak dollar. He thinks the current medium-term decline in the dollar
will end soon and that it may rally again due to interest rates bouncing from a
first quarter low. Gold could see an increase of 40% next year, reaching $2800
or so on the upside. The Japanese yen is also interesting, as Japan's stock
market has performed well due to a weak yen and lifted yield curve. However,
Felix Zulauf thinks that once all central banks begin easing in the second
half of 2024, the Japanese will not and the yen will strengthen dramatically.
