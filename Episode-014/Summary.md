### Summary

1. The global economy is doing well in some places and not so well in
others. The US economy is doing pretty good despite higher interest
rates. However, markets cannot thrive with central bank tightening and
quantitative easing.

2. There are conflicting narratives about the state of the economy and
markets. Some say everything is awesome again while others warn of a
rececession and bear market. It's important to take a cold and calculated
look at the data to see what is actually happening.

3. The US economy has held up well despite higher interest rates, which is
surprising. However, there has been a softening in other places like the
European Union and Canada. China also has its own problems.

4. It's important to separate markets from the economy. They can behave
differently depending on central bank behavior. For example, we have seen
cruddy economies with booming markets due to interest rate repression and
quantitative easing in the past.

5. The speaker believes that a rececession is needed to clear out deadwood
such as zombie companies and shopping malls. Reccessions are a natural part
of the business cycle and can help get rid of inflation. However, they also
cause personal tragedy for those who lose their jobs.
