### Summary

1. The global economy is facing a series of interconnected challenges,
referred to as the "permacrisis," which includes supply-side constraints,
regime change in the global economy, and outdated mindsets conditioned by
three decades of benign conditions with low inflation and interest rates.

2. Inflation will be a persistent threat due to these supply constraints,
leading to higher interest rates, costs of capital, lower valuations, and
a difficult transition from a highly indebted world, including sovereign debt.

3. The climate crisis is an existential issue that requires urgent action,
as the carbon budget associated with holding temperature increases on average
to 1.5 degrees Celsius will be used up before the end of this decade if
current trajectories continue.

4. Information asymmetries in markets can lead to market failures and
suboptimal outcomes, but signal theory suggests that behaviors or credentials
can help close these gaps and improve price discovery.

5. The digital transformation is a powerful scientific and technological
revolution with potential for productivity surges across the economy,
but implementation will be critical to avoid disrupting people's lives and
creating societal issues related to technological displacement.
