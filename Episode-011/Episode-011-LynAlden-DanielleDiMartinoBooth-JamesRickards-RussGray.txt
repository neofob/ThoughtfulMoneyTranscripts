 But TRUflation, follow it closely, trailing 12 months, 1.88%.
 The Fed will get to its 2% target and actually go below that, which they do not want.
 There's nothing like having a debt-ridden world with deflation, but that's kind of what's
 barreling down towards us, meaning the underlying fundamental value of the dollar is not at
 risk because of inflation, at least until after the election comes and goes, and then
 God knows what the progressives could bring in terms of central bank digital currency
 and universal basic income and modern monetary theory, the whole thing, we could have rip-roaring
 inflation.
 It's not an interim trade right now.
 Welcome to Thoughtful Money.
 I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart, and I've got something a little different
 for you today that I think you're really going to enjoy.
 Recently, I was invited to host a panel discussion on the future of money at the New Orleans
 Investment Conference, which has a well-earned reputation for attracting the world's foremost
 authorities on geopolitics, economics and investments.
 Now, I've moderated this panel for several years running and while the talent is elite,
 it's become a gathering of friendly peers who, with goodwill and respect, reunite to
 peel away as much of the fog obscuring the road ahead as they can, giving us a clear
 view of where our currency and money is headed.
 As usual, Danielle DiMartino Booth, Jim Rickards, and Russ Gray were there, and this year we
 had the pleasure of welcoming Lynn Alden to the group.
 I'll start the replay of this panel discussion in a moment, but first, let me note that this
 panel was just a single hour of the five days worth of excellent presentations, debates,
 panels and workshops that just concluded at this year's New Orleans conference.
 If you like the video I'm about to show you, check out the link below this video which
 sends you to a page where the replays for the entire conference can be purchased.
 Alright, with that said, let's start watching the future of money panel discussion featuring
 Danielle DiMartino Booth, Jim Rickards, Russ Gray and Lynn Alden.
 Alright, it is time for the annual future of money panel.
 We have an incredible panel and to introduce them, our moderator has an amazing background.
 He worked for Yahoo, eventually becoming the vice president for marketing for the entire
 country.
 Many of you know Adam Taggart from his work at Peak Prosperity and his awesome book Prosper,
 one of my top ten favorite books.
 If you don't have it, you need to get it.
 More recently, you probably know him for his work with Wealthion.
 He is the perfect emcee and moderator for this panel.
 Please welcome our good friend Adam Taggart.
 Alright, brother.
 Thank you, Robert, for that very kind intro.
 For those of you who know me through Wealthion, if you haven't heard the news, just want to
 put it out there, I actually left Wealthion about 72 hours ago to go independent.
 All that means is I'll be doing exactly what you're used to me doing going forward.
 I'll just be doing it 100% under my own brand.
 Details on that can be found at my new substack at AdamTaggart.Substack.com.
 I do want to say, so many of you who have come up to me in the halls or emailed me over
 the past couple days about the transition, you guys have been just so incredibly kind
 to me.
 Thank you.
 And if anybody wants to talk to me about what the vision for the new venture is, just catch
 me in the hall.
 I'll happily tell you anything you want to know about it.
 But on to more important details.
 As Robert said, this is the annual The Future of Money panel.
 We've got an amazing set of panelists here for you today.
 We've been doing this for a number of years, that it's kind of like a well-oiled machine
 at this point, but we've upgraded it this year with the addition of another excellent
 major mind.
 You'll find out who that is in just a second.
 But just to set a little bit of context here.
 In the investing world, everything is measured in currency units.
 How many dollars, euros, or yen does an asset cost?
 And how many more do we think we're going to get a chance to sell it for?
 That's the calculation we all do.
 But what happens when we start to worry about the purchasing power of those currency units?
 Will our dollars, euros, and yen buy us less tomorrow than they do today?
 And if so, how much less?
 And what are steps we can take today to protect our wealth from the risk of currency depreciation?
 We'll dive into all that and more, including the prospects for digital currencies in today's
 panel.
 Again, it's called The Future of Money.
 And boy, do we have a murderer's row of top-tier talent lined up for this discussion.
 Our panelists are James Rickards, financier, analyst, currency expert, and author of really
 too many books to list at this point.
 But his book Currency Wars, The Making of the Next Global Crisis, makes him a ringer
 for this panel.
 Hi, Jim.
 We've got Russ Gray, real estate investing expert and co-author of the book Equity Happens.
 Come on, Russ.
 Next we have Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and Chief Strategist of QI Research and author
 of the book Fed Up, an insider's take on why the Federal Reserve is bad for America.
 And today's newcomer, Lynn Alden, engineer turned investment strategist and author of
 the recent book Broken Money, Why Our Financial System is Failing Us and How We Can Make It
 Better.
 Guys, it really just doesn't get better than this in terms of talent.
 I'm very fortunate to call these people here on the panel both mentors and friends.
 I hope you feel the same of them as well after this is over.
 Guys, really no rules here.
 I will be asking questions.
 But if you have a response to something one of your co-panelists say, just jump right
 on in.
 You guys can hear me okay?
 Panelists?
 Yep.
 All right.
 Awesome.
 We're good this year then.
 All right.
 I'm going to start at a really high level.
 And Jim, I'm going to start off with you because, folks, I did ask the panelists each to submit
 a question that they thought would be core to what they wanted to express in this panel.
 And Jim started with, I think, the most important question of the day, which is what is money?
 Do we actually know what money is?
 You know, Jim, when you wrote to me, you said a lot of people think they know what money
 is, but don't be too sure.
 Why do you say that?
 Yeah.
 This panel is the future of money.
 I think we all know what the future is, not that we can predict it, but it seems it hasn't
 happened yet.
 But we assume we know what money is, and I would just raise a few questions.
 People would go, well, I know what money is.
 I've got money in the bank.
 I say, really?
 What you have is a bank deposit.
 If you look at a bank balance sheet, it's on the liability side of their balance sheet,
 which means, from their point of view, it's a form of debt.
 And you say, well, I'll go down and get my money any time I want.
 Good luck with that.
 More than-- I probably shouldn't give the amount, but anyway, from a friend-- but more
 than $3,000, unless your name is Hunter Biden, they'll file a Suspicious Activity Report,
 SAR, that goes to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
 Notice the word "crime."
 You'll be in a file not too far from Osama bin Laden, and probably heads up to the FBI.
 $10,000?
 That's a currency transaction report, mandatory.
 There's no judgment on the part of the banker.
 Same place, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, it's like putting a target on your back with
 the IRS.
 Why does this person need $10,000, all of a sudden?
 There are some exceptions for businesses that deal in cash, I guess a pizza parlor or something.
 But in general, you want $100,000, you have that much in the bank, they'll say thank you,
 come back, you need an appointment, bring your birth certificate and several forms of
 photo ID, et cetera, et cetera.
 And I'm not saying it's impossible to get, what I'm saying is the bank will give it to
 you if they feel like it, they'll file whatever reports they want.
 From their point of view, it's not money, it's a liability, a form of debt, that they
 owe to you.
 In terms of-- basically, the Federal Reserve is a good example-- Federal Reserve prints
 the money, they create it digitally, of course, by buying bonds, but the Federal Reserve prints
 the money.
 What does the Fed think money is?
 Well, they have M0, M1, M2, M3, et cetera, so even the institution, the central bank
 that prints the money has four definitions of money.
 They don't know what money is, and if you go back and read old transcripts of FOMC meetings
 and minutes of the meetings, and I'm just enough of a geek to do that now and then,
 you'll see comments from the late '90s by Alan Greenspan, and even earlier, going back
 to the 1980s, where the Federal Reserve governors and officials are saying to each other, "We
 lost the thread, we actually don't know what money is," and then don't even get started
 on the difference between domestic dollars and euro dollars, and I say euro dollars and
 US dollars, in basically outside the regulatory jurisdiction of the US, it could be transacted
 in New York or anywhere else, but it's a dollar that is subject to a different set of regulations,
 narrower bid offer spreads, kind of a wholesale, interbank market, but that's different from
 the domestic market, et cetera, and then you get into silver and gold.
 My friend Dominic Frisbee mentioned Bitcoin, he said it's a form of money, I disagree,
 it actually took me, you know, I say anything critical to Bitcoin, they go, "Ah, Jim, you're
 a technophobe, you don't get it," and I read Satoshi Nakamoto's paper in about a month
 after it came out, and I've been in Bitcoin debates starting in 2010, so I actually have
 followed it closely, but it took me a very long time to figure out what it is, because
 I know the technology and I know the exchanges and the transactions and all that, but what
 is it, actually, I don't think it's money, I think the nearest analog, you walk across
 the street, there's a casino, you buy a casino chip, you can play the chip in the casino,
 you can win money or lose money, when you're done, you have to go to the cashier and get
 cash and then you leave the casino, if you walk out of the casino with the chip, it's
 worthless, you can't buy a candy bar with a casino chip, so in other words, Bitcoin
 has value in the Bitcoin crypto world, but it's not good for anything else, you can't
 spend it, you can't really, but you can gamble with it all you want, I know people who've
 retired at a fairly young age with $25 million actually paid their taxes on, they bought
 Bitcoin at $1,000 and sold it at $20,000, so, but that's not money, it's just a form
 of gambling, Bitcoin I think is best understood as hallucinogen, so I'll stop there, but my
 point, Adam, is that things that, no seriously, everyone sees what they want, but my point
 is money is not as obvious as people think.
 All right, now obviously, you know, sort of like, you know, fish, women, water, water's
 all they're used to, I mean we're just used to the money that we deal with right now,
 of course most people in the room here, that's the U.S. dollar, you just talked a bit about
 yesterday, you know, despite the, you know, rapid growth recently in U.S. debts in our
 national deficits, the inflation that we've had over the past number of years, the dollar
 on a relative basis, you know, has actually stood up surprisingly well to many people.
 Where do you all see the U.S. dollar headed?
 Both in the near term, you know, next year or so, and in the longer term, and if you
 can in your answer, I'm gonna make this a complicated question, if you can give us that
 answer for its relative performance versus the other major world currencies, but also
 your outlook for its purchasing power.
 So short term, long term, relative performance, and purchasing power.
 Lynn, why don't we start with you?
 So I think part of that's gonna depend on how much the Treasury focuses on either strengthening
 or weakening it.
 We saw from the recent Treasury report that Janet Yellen and the rest of the Treasury
 are increasing their bill issuance, which allows them to get more liquidity out of the
 reverse repo facility.
 I think part of that is to try to arrest the recent rise in the dollar index, and arrest
 the recent rise in longer dated yields to add more liquidity focusing on the short end.
 So shorter term, we probably have some pause in the dollar index for a period of time.
 That could go away if they were to issue a lot more coupons.
 Again, longer term, I think, you know, my overall framework is that we're entering a
 more multipolar world, where we're seeing, this is not exactly news these days, but I've
 been writing about this for a number of years.
 It kind of accelerated with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and kind of has cascaded since
 there.
 But I think we're seeing a number of powers increasingly focusing on reserve diversification,
 making their own payment channels, although of course that's a very difficult process.
 They're up against a very substantial network effect, and this is like a very long term
 time frame.
 So I think we're entering a more multipolar world, rather than a world where every country
 just kind of unanimously uses dollars and doesn't really think twice about it.
 All right, great.
 Danielle, I'm sure you've got some opinions on this.
 So I mean, you know, I was kind of born and raised at the Fed, and I still have PTSD as
 a result.
 To understand that the U.S. dollar is the most attractive horse in the glue factory,
 glue factory nonetheless, it's just, you know, how long is the glue factory going to stay
 open?
 And I think there's an interesting phenomenon, it's been the deniability around the world
 of other recessions that are underway.
 So it wasn't until we saw the Eurozone in its entirety begin to contract that anybody
 was – even began to pay attention to the fact that Germany has been in recession now
 for three quarters in a row.
 I mean, they keep revising it downwards, but it is what it is since the fourth quarter
 of 2022.
 And when you think about the world's third largest exporting nation, which is what Germany
 is, and the fact that the world's largest exporting nation is as close to recession
 as you could possibly have that described by, you know, by statisticians that our statisticians
 now make blush, because our data is so ugly and dirty now, it makes Chinese look clean.
 But when you think about the three largest exporting nations in the world being in recession,
 then you really don't come out at the other end when you add to that the fact that, you
 know, everybody keeps saying that the dollar is at risk and yet they keep pricing their
 sovereign debt in dollars or corporate debt in dollars worldwide.
 So that's kind of where you come out at the other end saying at some point, you know,
 the dollar is going to continue to be the authority that it is on the world stage.
 On top of that, trueflation, TRU, which I know Adam I've spoken to you about before,
 they gave us the raw data from January of 2012.
 Cut it down.
 I know, like, we all need some more copyright.
 This is New Orleans.
 But TRUflation, follow it closely, trailing 12 months, 1.88 percent.
 The Fed will get to its 2 percent target and actually go below that, which they do not
 want.
 There's nothing like having a debt-ridden world with deflation, but that's kind of what's
 barreling down towards us, meaning the underlying fundamental value of the dollar is not at
 risk because of inflation, at least until after the election comes and goes, and then
 we could -- God knows what we're going to -- you know, what the progressives could bring
 in terms of central bank digital currency and universal basic income and modern monetary
 theory, the whole thing.
 We could have rip-roaring inflation.
 It should not -- not an interim trade right now.
 Okay.
 All right.
 I do want to get to the supply side, too, in terms of what we think the central banks
 are going to do, also your expectations about the market for dollars outside of the U.S.
 -- the euro dollar market.
 Let's see here.
 Let me stay with you just for one second, Danielle, and then Russ, we're going to come
 to you next.
 So, you know, George Gammon talked a bit yesterday about, you know, the delta in influence in
 terms of the dollar's performance of central banks versus the euro dollar market.
 In his opinion, he thought the euro dollar market was really the dominant force here
 to find what was going on.
 I'm curious -- well, let me distill this down first.
 What do you expect next from the Fed?
 Not much.
 Not much.
 Okay.
 Elaborate a little bit more on that.
 So I think that right now the prevailing goal is for Powell to be not noticed.
 He just wants to keep shrinking the balance sheet.
 So is it anything beyond semantics that with one bad employment report now we've priced
 from July to June of 2024 being the first rate cut?
 I don't think that's relevant in the sense of relativity matters.
 I don't think we're going to the zero bound anytime soon.
 I think he's still got decent control of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Federal
 Reserve Board.
 I don't think it's a coincidence that the dot plot ends with a two-handle, meaning out
 to 2025, meaning that I don't think he sees at least as long as he has not, you know,
 gone over by the CIA driving a truck and taken out an election year.
 I don't think that Powell plans on going back to the zero bound, and I think he's trying
 desperately to extricate quantitative easing from the toolbox, and the only way that you
 can do that is to continue shrinking that balance sheet.
 Okay.
 And do you think that's going to support the dollar then until such time as Powell either
 achieves his mission or is forced to -- I mean, hire for longer kind of goes hand-in-hand
 with that, right?
 Pardon?
 Hire for longer goes hand-in-hand with that.
 Exactly.
 Okay.
 So we've got, you know, the Fed pumping the brakes like you're talking about here.
 That's likely to be supportive of the dollar, at least in the near term.
 You look at somebody's outlook like a Felix Zulauf, right, who basically says we're now
 in the decade of the roller coasters, and it's going to be this era he sees where, you
 know, because of bad policies and because of really market forces that we will have
 these contractionary events that will, you know, bring markets down, bring asset prices
 down, and that will then force the central planners to step in and rescue and reinflate
 the system and then, you know, make the underlying issues that led to the bust worse again, and
 then we basically rinse and repeat in each time the rescue efforts that the central planners
 need to engineer is going to have to be larger than the one before.
 I'm curious, and I'll, let's see, I'll let anybody who wants to jump in answer this one
 first.
 Do you guys, is that the new cycle that we're now trapped in here, is that what you expect
 to see from here, that hire for longer will eventually end in some sort of either breakage
 in the system under this high cost of capital and drag the economy, asset prices down with
 a force, a pivot by the Fed if indeed it hasn't achieved its mission of under 2% inflation
 by then, and then we're back off to the races with the whole stimulus playbook?
 So I'm going to say, I'm going to be really short and sweet because I've spoken too much,
 but I do think that the American public has, has tasted the fruit of I don't have to pay
 for my contractual obligations.
 There are more of this cohort than any other.
 So I think that we will be voting in more of these policies and we have to bear in mind
 after the pandemic hit, the Fed was not able to go at it alone.
 It was a double barreled approach that was required, right?
 You had to have equal amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus.
 The Fed had to monetize every penny that was legislated.
 I think that that's where a lot of young Americans want to see this country go, and they're stacking
 the Federal Reserve Board with progressives who would pursue these policies.
 Okay, and you know, for those of you that are familiar with Neil Howe's work in the
 fourth turning, we are in a fourth turning right now by Neil Howe's calculation and fourth
 turnings are characterized, Neil says, by a greater centralized control.
 And what's interesting is, is not only does it come from the top down, but as Danielle
 is saying, it actually comes as a demand from the populace itself for more centralized control
 to solve these problems.
 So Neil expects the same thing.
 Russ, why don't you chime in on this here?
 This concept of decade of the roller coasters, I think that's near and dear to how you look
 at the world.
 What do you think?
 Yeah, so I'm the Main Street guy up here, so I don't live in the macro like these folks
 do.
 I try to figure out what it all means when it all rolls downhill and hits Main Street.
 But coming back to some of the prior topics and kind of wrapping it all up for me anyway
 is the concept of money, what is money.
 Currency and money are two different things.
 And I think that it's really important that you understand the difference.
 So Jim's book, New Case for Gold, is excellent for understanding money and money is a tool
 for wealth.
 And then currency is just a unit you want to transact in.
 But it has purchasing power, so you've got to pay attention to that.
 And then the other question that we're talking about was, how does it compare to like what's
 going on in the world?
 And, you know, for me, it's the same as Bitcoin in terms of a network effect.
 Right now, if you've got dollar denominated debt in the world, people have to earn dollars
 to service that debt.
 We've got still a very large economy.
 And if you earn in that economy, you've got to pay taxes in that economy, you have to
 earn dollars.
 That creates demand.
 The dollar collapsed in the '70s, the petrodollar system was instituted in order to create demand
 for the dollar.
 So just kind of watch for the dollar demands.
 There was the second part of the question you asked me, and I wanted to get that part
 out.
 Well, I sort of asked you about this projected feature of boom.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 So the Main Street part of it, is that you making all that noise?
 Pardon me?
 No.
 Okay.
 So, if you buy into buy low, sell high, which is what a lot of investors do, they think
 that's, you know, investing 101 is buy low, sell high.
 And so asset prices matter a lot.
 And what drives asset prices a lot is credit.
 You look at how much credit is in the system, and asset prices kind of track that.
 I know that to be true in real estate, you know, somebody trips over the cord that pumps
 all the air into the jump house, like in 2008, or even right now with interest rates rising,
 and the equity begins to come out of the market.
 And if you buy real estate focused on the asset price, then you find out that your equity
 is air.
 Stocks, for example, are often priced by comparative sampling, 10 million shares of Apple or whatever
 it is out there, however many millions, or I don't know, and somebody sells a thousand
 of them for a certain price, everybody else who's holding those prices think, oh, that's
 my price too, until everybody shows up in the market.
 So that's a rollercoaster ride.
 And our thesis in our opening presentation, the pre-conference workshop, is that the people
 who run the casinos thrive in the chaos.
 They actually want to create it up and down, up and down, up and down.
 If you invest for income, cash flow, it's a lot more stable.
 If you just look at the asset prices of real estate versus the rents on real estate, rents
 are very stable.
 And so I think that if you set up your portfolio based on income, and you denominate your net
 worth based on income, which, how do you do that?
 Well, if you have a $5 million property with no debt and no income, you might say, well,
 I got a $5 million net worth, and you'd be true assets minus liabilities equals net worth.
 You get a $2 million property with a million dollar loan and $100,000 a year income, passive
 income, right?
 You get a million dollar net worth, but who's richer in the real world?
 So I think you can create a lot of stability in the rollercoaster by focusing on the income
 side.
 And I think that once you get that income, converting it into real money, where you can
 store real wealth, into real assets.
 So to me, I mean, I think there's always going to be volatility, because I think the people
 that participate in the markets thrive on it.
 And I think it's kind of built into the system.
 So as a Main Street person, I just want to try to find a way to insulate myself from
 that.
 To me, that's the focus on income from things that are necessary and essential, and I don't
 think it gets any better than housing or real estate related to essential businesses.
 Great.
 And, you know, housing is an inflation-adjusting asset, right?
 As inflation goes up, you have the ability to charge higher rents.
 But obviously, that's a big question that people have when they think about the future
 of money, is inflation and about the future of the purchasing power of the currency.
 Jim, I'm curious, what is your long-term inflation outlook right now?
 Well, just in terms of what could cause it, I think the Fed is completely irrelevant.
 Now, by the way, I read the Fed minutes, I watch the press conferences, I analyze the
 Fed.
 I don't want to, you know, disseminate.
 I spend a lot of time thinking about it.
 But my conclusion is that they're irrelevant.
 So in 2008, December 2008, the base money supply was approximately $800 billion.
 In 2020, it reached almost $10 trillion.
 There was no inflation.
 There was no inflation.
 The whole long expansion and the, I don't know how to talk about 2020, I mean, the economy
 goes down 32% one quarter and back up 34% in the following quarter.
 That's not a business cycle.
 That's just turning off the lights.
 But there was no inflation.
 It wasn't 2022, I'll come back to that.
 That was real inflation.
 But inflation ran about, it barely got to the Fed's goal of 2%.
 It would be 1.6, 1.7, talking about core PCE, that's their preferred measure.
 They were dying to get it to 2%.
 They kept printing money and they couldn't do it.
 All that tells you is that that money supply is irrelevant to inflation.
 Now, what is the driver is velocity, which is a psychological phenomenon.
 It's a behavioral phenomenon.
 So any amount of money supply can be inflationary if velocity takes off, if expectations of
 inflation take off and people adapt their behavior, then can it be inflationary?
 Of course.
 But what's driving it?
 It's not the money.
 It's the velocity.
 It's the behavioral aspect.
 Now what happened in 2022 is interesting because inflation has two sources, if you will.
 The velocity and the psychology and, gee, I better go out and buy that refrigerator
 today because it's going to be more expensive in three months, which I lived through in
 the '70s and the early '80s.
 That's from the demand side.
 That's demand side inflation.
 But there's also supply side inflation.
 And what we had in 2022, of course, was a major breakdown in the whole supply chain.
 Which, by the way, you wrote about eloquently in your book, Sold Out.
 Thank you.
 That was a book about the supply chain.
 Actually, it had three chapters on inflation, deflation, and capital markets, but a lot
 of it was logistics.
 That's okay.
 But the point is, and we saw the same thing in the '70s.
 So maybe the '70s, the entire '70s are a good model.
 What happened in 1973 is Arab-Israeli war, sounds familiar, and Arab oil embargo.
 That was highly inflationary.
 But it was a supply side shock.
 And I remember Gerald Ford and Alan Greenspan walking around with wind buttons to whip inflation
 now.
 Well, those buttons were off in about six months because they say the cure for higher
 oil prices is high oil prices.
 That price shock was so great that it threw the economy into what, at the time, was the
 most severe recession since the Great Depression.
 And I got an undergrad in 1973.
 All my friends went to Wall Street.
 I probably wasn't mature enough, so I went to graduate school.
 But they were all like, I got a job with Merrill Lynch or whatever.
 And then they were all fired the following year.
 The Christmas parties in December '74 were very depressing because they all got fired.
 But then, after kind of normal growth, inflation came back with a vengeance.
 But that stems from the demand side.
 So my point simply is that you have to separate supply side inflation and demand side inflation.
 They're different things.
 They're both inflationary in the sense that price indices go up.
 But supply side inflation tends to be self-extinguishing.
 It puts itself out because it throws the economy into recession.
 Demand side can feed on itself, and that's where you need maybe more extreme remedies.
 So the Fed can-- the Fed kind of lights the fire and fights the fire.
 But those psychological and logistical inputs are more important.
 Now what's going on today, because that was really your question-- we're in a period of
 disinflation bordering on deflation.
 We've just come through a period of inflation, for sure, 9.1% in June 2022.
 But that was supply side driven.
 That has snuffed itself out.
 A lot of the logistics problems have been solved.
 And there's actually less demand.
 You don't have to worry about logistics if people don't want the stuff.
 You know, gasoline is a good example.
 Gasoline consumption is dropping.
 But usually demand is pretty inelastic.
 It's the kind of thing-- you know, you need your gasoline.
 No matter what the price is, you've got to go to school or take the kids to school or
 go to work or whatever.
 So you buy it anyway, even though, you know, the price is pretty uncomfortable.
 But the usage is actually dropping.
 That's a very powerful recession sign.
 There are others looking inside the euro dollar market.
 The swap spreads are negative.
 What's a swap spread?
 You know, a swap is, you know, you pay-- I pay a fixed rate and you pay me a floating
 rate or vice versa.
 It's a derivative bond.
 It's a synthetic bond position.
 If I own a bond, I finance it overnight.
 I'm receiving fixed and paying floating.
 So swap spreads are the difference between the risk-free rate-- what can you get if you
 buy a five-year note or a 10-year note on the one hand and what a dealer pays you on
 the fixed leg of a swap.
 Now it follows-- that could be anywhere-- but it follows that the government rate should
 be lower than the counterpart rate.
 If I have a five-year Treasury note that's as safe as you can get versus a bank paying
 me a fixed rate for five years, like, OK, good bank, but there's a little risk there.
 So it follows that the bank rate should be higher than the government rate in the fixed
 leg of a swap.
 It's not true today.
 I mean, the statement is true, but the data is the opposite.
 The bank is paying a lower rate than the government.
 Now why would that be true?
 Right.
 And sorry to interrupt, Jim, but that's why so many bank deposits are fleeing right now
 to the money markets and T-bills.
 Correct.
 And where it's a symptom of that phenomenon.
 So are bank credits suddenly better than government credits?
 No, not at all.
 The reason they're lower is because the banks are having difficulty financing derivatives
 positions because they can't get enough good collateral.
 And banks can put a swap on without using any balance sheet capacity, whereas if I'm
 financing a bond, I am using balance sheet capacity.
 So it's a liquidity preference, and it's a balance sheet preference-- in other words,
 it's not lower because of credit, it's lower because of liquidity preferences and the inability
 to get collateral.
 By the way, just to kind of wrap it all up, the demand for collateral, Treasury bills
 in particular, is so great.
 That's why the dollar is strong.
 You know, interest rate differentials, capital controls, all that stuff, I mean, I've studied
 that since the 1970s.
 It goes back to the 1950s.
 A lot of it is obsolete in the world we live in.
 What does drive-- what does make the dollar stronger and drive foreign exchange rates
 is the demand for dollars itself.
 If I'm Deutsche Bank and I want to buy Treasury bills, that's fine.
 I got to pay for them in dollars, which means I have a demand for dollars.
 And no one's more desperate than the Chinese.
 And people-- I debate this with my research partners, like, hey, time to go long to the
 yen.
 The yen's going back to 135 or whatever.
 I say, guys, when I started in banking, the yen was 400.
 So if you go back not all that far, it's kind of deja vu all over again.
 But the point is, the Japanese yen is joined at the hip with the Chinese yuan because of
 the extent of Chinese-- sorry, Japanese banks are financing everything in China.
 And they don't want a stronger yen because that's going to hurt their business in China
 and hurt Chinese exports, et cetera.
 And so the yen and the yuan are just locked in a de facto peg.
 And the yuan's going down, so the yen's going down.
 So look for it to go to 160.
 But that liquidity, the euro-dollar market, and the supply and demand, and the demand
 for collateral, that's what's driving exchange rates, not interest rate differential.
 So forget the Bank of Japan and forget the Fed while you're at it.
 OK.
 All right.
 Well, look, we're heading into the homestretch here.
 So I'm going to ask a few more questions that I know the audience wants to hear.
 I'm going to need to have sort of relatively rapid-fire answers to try to get through them
 all.
 I wish we had like another three hours, but we're going to do the best for the remaining
 nine minutes we have.
 So to Jim's comment there about we've been in inflation, we're now in disinflation, deflation
 might be right around the corner.
 This isn't necessarily a currency question, but it's topical to everything everyone's
 talking about this conference.
 And, Danielle, I'm coming to you with this, which was your question when I asked you what
 question would you like the panel to address, which is, when recession?
 Right?
 So what do you peg as the odds of us heading into recession from here as we enter 2024?
 So as a former central banker, I do comfortably think in trillion-dollar increments.
 And when you add up -- and this is something that's been bothering me because, well, social
 media is not a kind place.
 And when you're calling for recession, recession doesn't come.
 It's an even less kind environment.
 But in any event, I started to say to myself, where's the money coming from?
 You know, after the election, after the midterm election, we got rid of the public health
 emergency.
 So the $250 monthly stipend on average of food stamps went away.
 The Medicaid rolls, they were shrunken back.
 And I said, where's the money continuing to come from that's pushing and it couldn't just
 be credit card spending?
 But eventually, I dug and dug and dug.
 And anybody ever heard of Kevin O'Leary?
 Right.
 Uh-huh.
 So all of this employee retention credit, when you add it up, $474 billion was pumped
 into the economy in the 36 months ended July 2023.
 Add that to the Paycheck Protection Program, 757 billion of which was forgiven, you get
 to $1.231 trillion, that's where your recession is.
 So – and if you think about where the money went, it went into the hands of your top quintile
 of earners, but it was windfall.
 So even though you're supposed to – even though economics 101 teaches us, you give
 money to people with the highest propensity to spend, which is what the stimulus checks
 did, that's what the additional supplemental unemployment benefits did, it went into the
 hands of people with the highest propensity to spend.
 It ignited inflation as we know it.
 But for the high net worth individuals who got this $1.23 trillion windfall, it was unexpected.
 They too spent it.
 They spent it on international travel.
 It's – why did the employee retention credit – the plug was pulled, work that we did
 at QI Research went all the way to the House Ways and Means Committee, thank you, God.
 They pulled the plug on this thing.
 Why did LVMH stock peak in July?
 That's when the employee retention credit peaked.
 So that's where the recession is, Adam.
 It's in $1.231 trillion that nobody wants to talk about.
 It's Voldemort, but it went straight into the U.S. economy.
 So it's in basically the ending of that stealth stimulus to those –
 November the 30th – so this November the 30th is the cessation of the FHA's final
 forbearance measures.
 So starting next month, December the 1st, so some people have not paid their mortgage
 since March of 2020 with the passage of the CARES Act.
 That is the last vestige of fiscal stimulus in the form of direct cash into people's
 pockets or cash that they're not spending.
 Okay.
 So fair to say Daniel DiMartino-Booth looks at 2024 as the year of –
 I think we're in recession.
 Look out below.
 I think we're in recession today.
 The SOM rule, which is very – it's a vigorous rule, tells you that if the unemployment rate
 rises by a half a percentage point that you're technically looking in the rearview window
 in recession.
 That is certainly what happened in the month of October with yesterday's nonfarm payroll
 report.
 Okay.
 Great.
 I don't know if I could just drop a foot down that career, Daniel.
 People forget the first two quarters of 2022 we had negative GDP growth, two quarters in
 a row.
 And Janet Yellen said don't call it a recession.
 I mean, that's the standard rule of thumb.
 I said, oh, did we not have a recession then?
 Well, the National Bureau of Economic Research hasn't called it and Janet Yellen said don't
 you dare.
 But that should have been taken as a warning that not all was well.
 We had some kind of mini recession back then.
 And I agree with Danielle.
 I would say that she said it might start in a couple of days.
 I think it probably started – we'll find that the recession started somewhere in September
 or October.
 Okay.
 But we're already in it.
 Awesome.
 All right, Lynn, I'm going to ask you the question I was going to ask every panelist
 if we had enough time.
 We don't.
 So I'm going to let you bat clean up here.
 In terms of our money system, you know, you've just written the book Broken Money.
 You've done a very deep dive into what it is, what's going on, what the future of money
 looks like.
 If you were in charge, what kind of system would you put in place?
 I think if you go back to some of the literature over the past century and a half about what
 is money, the best money has emerged naturally.
 They're not imposed top down.
 They emerge bottom up.
 So gold wasn't selected by some world emperor as money.
 It's just that as different civilizations and their different levels of technology kind
 of found out what's going to make good money, they could break certain types of money.
 If some culture uses shells as money, it works for a long time.
 But if another culture's technology is better, they can make all the shells and dilute them.
 But no one can do that for gold and silver.
 And so gold and silver rise naturally as money.
 I think going forward, there's kind of a battle between bottom up monies and top down monies
 as we get more and more digital.
 So most money is digital already, but it's becoming even more digital over time.
 A number of countries want to phase out cash or diminish cash and replace it with central
 bank digital currencies, which kind of takes away the last vestiges of analog currency
 and make that digital, or at least continue shifting the role more and more digital.
 At the same time, there are open source monies.
 These are actually the bottom up varieties in the new digital age.
 And so I think going forward, and I do some work in venture capital in this space.
 And so I see kind of the upcoming pipeline of what people are building, what people are
 building upon, some of the cool things that are happening.
 So for example, there's an open source protocol called Fediment.
 There's a company called Fedi that builds on top of it.
 It stands for federated charming mint, so they basically resurrected 40 year old encryption
 technology, decided they can put it on top of Bitcoin.
 And so now anyone in say Africa or Latin America can start their own community bank.
 So a number of custodians can have like, you know, they custody the funds as part of like
 a federated entity.
 And people can hold either Bitcoin or dollar stable coins in that if they're in a highly
 inflationary environment, you know, they don't want to hold the local currency.
 Now they can receive Bitcoin or dollar payments.
 They can, you know, you can have a video chat, get a QR code, and to send payment bypasses
 their local banking system.
 You can send payment over an email, you can send payment over an app, basically all these
 different things.
 And they can make use of jurisdictional arbitrage.
 So for example, the companies that are designing these tools, if one country becomes problematic
 for them, they can move to another country.
 And so for example, there's companies all around the world in multiple different jurisdictions
 building these types of tools.
 And then the cool thing about that type of community bank is you can have other things
 on top of it too.
 So in addition to Bitcoin and dollar payments, you can have data storage.
 And you can have, you know, like, access to chat GBT.
 So instead of having a subscription that you have to pay every month in dollar terms with
 your credit card, maybe you're in a jurisdiction where that's harder, you can do micropayments,
 you can pay three cents a question, you know, if you want to use it less, and you can access
 the API through this app.
 Right.
 So there's futures like that, these communities building bottom-up technologies that are kind
 of tying into existing network effects.
 So I think the big battle going forward is that all these different silos, these different
 jurisdictions are going to try to impose their top-down system.
 But there's also unleashed a new, you know, software in the world, and kind of the latest
 thing that software is trying to eat is money.
 And I think that's the future battle, and I think it's going to take years and decades.
 It sounds like you're saying, though, that we maybe are now living through a renaissance
 in money, and we may see some things emerge out of that that maybe we can't even imagine
 quite yet, but could potentially be introducing new solutions that might even be much better
 than anything we can imagine right now.
 That's why I view it, yeah.
 All right, fantastic.
 All right, well, look, in our last minute here, just a quick answer from each of you.
 As a recommendation for the audience, can you share either what you consider to be a
 great book on money or a great publication on money that you think the audience would
 benefit from researching after this conference?
 And it can't be one of your own books.
 So, Jim, you first.
 [ Laughter ]
 Good one there, Adam.
 Yeah, Mary Beard's SPQR, it's a history of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire, but if
 you want to understand how -- if you don't have sound money, you do not have a sound
 political system, in that the decline of money presages the decline of the political system
 itself.
 And we all talk about the fall of the Roman Empire, but she does a deep dive and covers
 the fall of the Roman Republic, which is a different thing before the rise of the Empire.
 It's a really good overview.
 All right, fascinating.
 Russ?
 So I have two.
 I already threw out New Case for Gold, which is a simple read, but it really makes a great
 point.
 There's another kind of little esoteric book called Layered Money by Nick Batia.
 So it helped me understand kind of the intersection of money and crypto.
 Great.
 Danielle?
 So my mentor at the Fed recommended that I read the Lords of Finance, and it really resolved
 a lot of my internal tension with having actually worked at a place like the Fed.
 But it explains everything that you could ever imagine about what got us to where we
 are today as hyper-focused on something as boring as what occurred at 2.30 p.m. Eastern
 Standard Time Wednesday afternoon, which was J-PAL's press conference, holding on to every
 single word.
 Read the Lords of Finance.
 Excellent.
 And Lin?
 I will second Layered Money by Nick Batia.
 He's an acquaintance of mine.
 It's a great book.
 And also I'll recommend Central Banking 101 by Joseph Wang, a former Fed employee.
 It kind of is like a really just concise, just objective overview of how money systems
 work.
 The nuts and bolts of it.
 Great.
 And Joseph, you can find his work at FedGuy.com, right?
 I believe so.
 Okay.
 @FedGuy12, I think.
 Yeah, on Twitter.
 Yeah, @FedGuy12.
 All right.
 Look, thanks so much, everybody.
 Huge round of applause for our panelists.
