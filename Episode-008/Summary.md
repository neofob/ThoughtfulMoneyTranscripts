### Summary

1. The conversation between Adam Taggart and Jesse Felder revolves around the
potential impact of a recession on the US economy and financial markets. They
discuss the possibility that a recession could lead to an explosion in the
supply of treasuries, causing interest rates to rise instead of falling as
many expect.

2. The current market is priced for "soft landing nirvana," which assumes
that the Fed has successfully raised interest rates without creating a
recession or financial turmoil. However, there are risks to this assumption,
including the possibility that inflation remains high and requires further
monetary tightening.

3. There are also concerns about the potential for a debt crisis due to the
growing imbalance between the supply and demand for treasuries. This could
lead to higher long-term interest rates and turbulence in the Treasury market,
which would have implications for both the economy and financial markets.

4. The conversation touches on the idea of a "sea change" in the investing
landscape, with structural inflation trends potentially leading to slower
economic growth, lower profit margins, higher default rates, less reliable
asset appreciation, and a rising cost of borrowing. This could require
investors to adopt new strategies and approaches.

5. Finally, there is discussion about the potential for a commodity
supercycle driven by underinvestment in natural resources and overinvestment
in technology. This could create opportunities for investors who are able
to identify and capitalize on these trends.
