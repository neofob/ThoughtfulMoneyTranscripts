 I think what people don't necessarily think about or appreciate is, if we go into recession,
 the $2 trillion deficit, what happens to that? Revenue comes down even further,
 and so you get $2 trillion, you get $3 trillion, $4 trillion, and so the supply of treasuries is
 going to explode at a faster rate once you go into recession. Everybody who's thinking that,
 "OK, recession means economy is going to slow and interest rates are going to come down," could be
 in for a major surprise if recession actually means deficit blows out even wider, treasury
 supplies grow dramatically, and interest rates actually go up in the onset of recession.
 That's the thing I think I'm worried about the most right now.
 Welcome to Thoughtful Money. I'm its founder and your host, Adam Taggart. When the game changes,
 the old rules don't apply anymore, and to succeed you need to adopt a new playbook. Well, there's a
 good argument to be made that the investing game board has materially changed in the post-covid
 era, but so far both Wall Street and regular investors are still playing by the old rules.
 Is this a recipe for disaster? To find out, we've got the good fortune today to hear from Jesse
 Felder, founder and editor of the Felder Report, a highly respected market research firm. He's written
 a lot lately on the sea change the economy and financial markets have recently experienced.
 We'll ask him what the biggest implications will be and how investors should adapt to them. Jesse,
 thanks so much for joining us today. Adam, it's good to be with you. Thanks for having me.
 Hey, it's always a total pleasure to have you on the channel. Welcome to the new channel here,
 Thoughtful Money. Great to have you amongst the early guests here. You are definitely
 at the head of that panoply of great experts that we've had on here, Jesse, so very, very grateful
 that you've made the time for us here. Look, I got a lot of questions for you based upon your recent
 comments about the sea change that you're warning folks about. Real quickly before we dive into the
 specifics of that, can we just kick off with the general question I like to ask here at the start
 of these interviews, which is what is your current assessment of the global economy and financial
 markets? Well, it's a good question because I think there is a disparity between the trajectory
 of the economy and what markets seem to be pricing in. I can't remember who said it last week, but
 there was a quote that I heard a guest on Bloomberg say that markets have essentially priced in
 soft landing nirvana. I think he was coming from a bullish perspective, obviously, that he thought
 that the recent data justified this idea of soft landing nirvana. To me, you hear of markets that
 are priced for perfection. Well, a market that's priced for nirvana is an even different thing.
 That sets up a lot of room for disappointment. I think that's where we're at, where markets have
 fully discounted the soft landing idea that the Fed has raised interest rates without creating
 a recession and without creating any real financial turmoil in the process.
 I think there's a potential to fail on both points of that soft landing thesis. One would be that
 it's very possible that the inflation battle is not yet won. We've seen, I think it was John
 authors pointed out that markets have priced in, I think this is the seventh time markets are trying
 to price in a Fed pivot for the past, since they started hiking interest rates. Maybe seventh time
 is the charm. I don't know, but there's, I think, still a good chance, especially with what you see
 inflation expectations doing, that the Fed's job is not done yet. I think J-PAL has been very clear
 that this hire for longer is what they intend to do. We could miss on the inflation side. Inflation
 might not come down back sustainably to the Fed's target without more in terms of monetary policy,
 and more could just disappoint the markets in terms of not being able to pivot,
 having to maintain higher interest rates and maintain quantity of tightening for a longer
 period of time. I think even more likely is maybe we fail on the economy side, where instead of a
 soft landing, we do get a recession. There's all kinds of things that point to that. I mean, we're
 right in the timeframe now, where you would expect the lags of monetary tightening to start kicking
 in. There are all kinds of leading indicators that have suggested that we're headed for a recession.
 Obviously, third quarter GDP was a strong positive surprise, but it looks like, especially,
 I listened to or read through a lot of conference call transcripts and things, and there's a lot of
 companies that are starting to disappoint on the revenue side. I mean, Apple was a real notable one,
 but it was just one among many that are talking about-- I think even Bloomberg pointed out,
 the number of companies pointing out weak demand going forward hit a multi-year, multi-decade high.
 That's, I think, a pretty good sign that there's risk to the soft landing
 narrative on the economy side. So I think markets are priced for the soft landing nirvana,
 and that might not be what we get over the next few quarters.
 Okay, guys, there's so many directions I want to take that. I want to dive into reasons for
 why inflation may stay stickier for longer, causing the Fed to be higher for longer.
 Obviously, I want to get your thoughts about odds for a recession here. And this rash of
 disappointing guidance definitely doesn't mean we're going to have a recession, but it's
 definitely something you would expect to see potentially heading into one. Real quick, though,
 I do want to get to your comments there about this sea change. And I believe you've been putting
 those in quotation marks in your recent writings, and I believe that's because you're pulling the
 term from Howard Marks from a letter that he wrote, I don't know, it was like a year ago,
 eight months ago. And let me just go through the bullets of what Howard Marks listed when he talked
 about the sea change, and I'd love for you to kind of just react to them any way you like.
 Basically, he says, look, if we are exiting an era of declining and/or ultra low interest rates,
 which is pretty much what we-- that was the path from the interest rate heights of the early '80s
 until basically December of 2021, was this disinflation of the interest rate,
 just steady tailwind at the back of bond investors and anybody that wanted to raise cheap capital.
 He believes that era may be over. We've maybe hit an inflection point, and things are going to be
 different going forward. If that's true, he says, then we need to begin to expect and price in
 slower economic growth, lower profit margins, higher default rates, less reliable asset
 appreciation, a rising cost of borrowing, investor psychology that will no longer remain, quote,
 "uniformly positive," and that financing will be harder to obtain. And in essence, he said,
 more kind of like normalcy, like the way the world used to work before we had all this intervention
 on the central bank's part, monkeying around with interest rates.
 So I guess first question is, I'm assuming you've been talking about the sea change a
 lot because you think there's something to it. And if so, what are the implications of all this?
 Yeah, well, I mean, I'm glad that you ran through all those points because yes, I have pulled the
 term from Howard Marks, but I think there's just a number of very successful, very experienced
 investors that have been kind of singing the same song and pointing out the same issue that
 what has worked over the last 15 years in the wake of the great financial crisis is not necessarily
 what's going to work for the next 10 or 15 years. And it comes back to those dynamics that have
 shifted so dramatically, right? The downtrend in interest rates, but it's the shift in inflation
 also. And I come back to kind of three main things that I'm looking at. And one is basically just
 globalization, right? What drove the disinflation, I think, over the last 40 years was the trend to
 bringing costs down by offshoring labor. You also had demographics with baby boomers coming into the
 workforce. So you had a huge kind of positive supply shock with so much labor coming in,
 baby boomers coming in in the United States, and then also this huge new labor force that companies
 taking advantage of in China, whatever, and brought the cost of production down dramatically
 for all kinds of things to the extent that now the baby boomers are retiring. And we have a shift
 here in the demographics in the United States where you have a shrinking workforce relative to
 the overall population. Goodheart and Pradhan's book that came out about a year ago really does
 a great job at discussing the demographic side of this. But it's also the globalization side where
 companies are realizing the risks of offshoring all production to China and pharmaceuticals and
 semiconductors and all these kinds of things and creates real risks to the business and then also
 to national security. And so we have this trend towards deglobalization, and that is a major sea
 change. That's a huge reversal in the cost of production. And so these two kind of disinflationary
 forces of demographics and globalization have reversed course, and they're now both supportive
 of inflation in a secular way. So not just cyclical forces, but over the longer term.
 And then when you add, I think, debt dynamics on top of these things, you know, people like
 Ray Dalio and Bill Dudley, former head of the New York Fed, have warned of this growing imbalance
 in the supply and demand for treasuries. And the widening fiscal deficit is also, I think,
 an inflationary dynamic. So when you put all three of these things together, it really, to me,
 suggests that the longer term fight against inflation is far from one.
 And so you have to think about, OK, well, if all these investments that worked in a disinflationary
 environment, now that the background has shifted from disinflation to structural inflation trends,
 you have to think that it is a sea change for investors. And completely, as you said,
 changes the playbook to where I have to find things that work in a different environment now,
 because what's worked over the last 10, 15 aren't going to work. They're not going to have the tail
 winds that drove asset prices for the preceding decade. All right. I want to talk about all those
 if I can. And Jesse, thanks for being my guinea pig on this new StreamYard service we're using
 here. I normally use Zoom. So I'm trying to do some stuff on the fly in the background while
 you're talking here. Well, let's try this one. So on globalization, there are, obviously,
 that that is, to a certain extent now, going into reverse. In the post-COVID, post-Ukraine era,
 the world is sort of starting to fracture a bit, becoming much less unipolar. Countries are
 beginning to say, hey, maybe we've become either too dependent on supply chains that
 proved to be very efficient but very unresilient. Or maybe we had alliances that we didn't realize
 could burn us as badly or turn on us as quickly as we're seeing happen to some other countries
 around the globe. And so everybody is sort of looking out for themselves a little bit more here.
 So Citadel founder, Kid Griffin, recently said that the world is facing unrest and structural
 changes that are pushing it towards deglobalization and causing higher baseline
 inflation that may, quote unquote, "last for decades." And he recently tweeted out
 this chart here showing that globalization is indeed-- the chart's title, Globalization Has
 Slowed-- I would actually probably title this thing, like, globalization is actually starting
 to shrink. So how big of a trend change is this? Well, I mean, I think it's as big as they come.
 I think we probably underestimate-- when you have these trends like globalization that last
 for 40 years, where we're offering production of all these different things overseas, you just
 become-- that's the water that we're swimming in. We don't really notice it anymore. And so when it
 shifts, people don't necessarily notice the shift right away. It takes time for these things to play
 out. And I think that's where we're at with inflation is people think, OK, we've had this
 cyclical shift in inflation that was magnified by all the unique characteristics of the pandemic.
 But I think what's gone on under the surface is this inflationary shift with de-globalization and
 demographics that people haven't really noticed that side of it yet. And I think those are the
 far more important drivers. And so you can just take something like semiconductors are maybe a
 good example. And I think we're basically investing massively in production of semiconductors here in
 the United States, which is probably really a good thing for national security. And it's probably a
 good thing for consumers because we're going to be creating a lot more semiconductors. So you're
 really boosting the supply of these things. But what I don't think maybe investors appreciate
 is that it creates-- and actually, the CEO of Nvidia and other major semiconductor companies
 have warned about this-- that if demand stays the same, and globally, China's investing massively in
 production of semiconductors, the United States is investing massively in the production of
 semiconductors, you have huge supplies coming online. And demand isn't really changing as
 dramatically. That's not bullish for prices going forward. So we might be over-investing right now.
 And that's usually what happens. I mean, one of my favorite things to look at-- and I think this
 is a really important part of this discussion-- is just the capital cycle, right? When money goes
 into a sector, it usually creates a lot of over-investment. And then you get a bust or
 a crash in prices. We saw this in the energy sector. Through the financial crisis, Fed cut
 rates to zero. Corporate debt costs came down very, very low. And it allowed the fracking
 companies to massively over-invest in the production of oil in the United States. What
 happened a few years later? The oil price crashed in 2014. And so since then, these companies have
 essentially been starved of capital because investors have been burned so badly. They go,
 OK, we don't want to invest in energy ever again. And then you have the ESG movement and all these
 things. And so these companies literally don't have the funds to invest in production. And so now
 the trend is that we're probably under-investing in energy production. And that should be bullish
 for prices for a period of time, which is one reason I've talked about for a few years now,
 the idea of another commodity supercycle. So what we've done on the flip side, though,
 is in the wake of the dot-com bust in the early mid-2000s, we probably under-invested in technology
 for a number of years. And that's set the stage for this huge boom in technology now where we're
 under-supplied and demand is-- or we have been until now. But I think now we're at the point
 with technology where we're potentially massively over-investing in things like semiconductors.
 We're massively over-investing in startups. And for the last five, six, seven years, this has
 been the case, which is why you're seeing so many of these electric vehicle startups start to go
 bust, stock prices down 80%, 90%, because we've over-invested in a lot of these things. And I
 think that's potentially the case right now in semiconductors. I think it's the case probably
 in cloud and in AI. Just so much money is going into the sector that returns have to come down
 over the next few years. And this is, I think, something people don't appreciate. This is one
 of the first areas where big tech companies are competing directly head-to-head, right?
 Until now, they've each kind of had their own niche where they haven't really been competing
 with each other. And that's preserved profit margins in their specific niches. But now that
 they're all investing massively and competing head-to-head, returns in a lot of these industries
 are going to come down. And just from the standpoint of the capital cycle, so much money
 going into these things, that future returns have to come down. And I think that's the point that
 I'm trying to make is that we're in a new super cycle for commodities because the underinvestment
 has been so significant. And the over-investment in technology and similar things is going to
 potentially create a number of years, like we saw in the wake of the dot-com
 bust, where you're going to have disappointing returns on investment from those companies.
 That's a great point about the competition, the direct competition in tech. I think that's
 something that's really pretty underappreciated right now. And you're tying together a number of
 different threads that a number of different experts on this program recently have been
 raising. One, we've had folks like Rick Rule and Tavi Costa on the hard asset side, the natural
 resources side, really waving just a massive warning flag about the underinvestment in many
 different commodity sectors in terms of the lack of CapEx that's gone into those sectors, either
 because management has decided that they want to start returning higher dividends to shareholders,
 but mostly because things like the administration has been making it a lot more uncertain as to
 whether the long-term return on their projects that they would invest in today is going to be.
 And this isn't anything new. I'm not beating up necessarily on the current administration.
 A lot of these issues have been going on for years, if not decades. And guys like Rick say,
 even if demand were just to be flat going forward from here, we're going to be entering real
 structural shortages in a number of key commodities based on investment decisions that were made 10,
 15, 20 years ago. So we've got all that ahead of us here. At the same time, everybody is
 in love still with big tech. And it's been the Magnificent Seven that have rescued the markets
 this year, driving everything up with it. The FAANGs is what powered everybody up for much of
 the past decade. Now it's the Magnificent Seven, kind of a rebrand. But I just interviewed Fred
 Hickey on this channel just a couple of days ago. And he's famous for writing his newsletter,
 The High Tech Strategist. He's been following these companies, these types of companies since
 the '80s. And he says he's almost never been sort of as short-term bearish on the complex as he is
 right now. You're raising something that's more of a mid-term risk than what Fred's waving.
 But the point is there's a ton of faith in the generals right now, the companies that have really
 been responsible for driving the market indices higher. Fred sees some real short-term risk.
 You see some mid- to longer-term risk as they begin to compete with each other more directly
 and the profits get competed away. Again, I guess a good term to describe all this are sort of like
 sea changes. It's opening the door to a future that we haven't seen for so long that for most
 investors today, it's going to be like terra incognita. Yeah. Well, I love Fred's work. I
 read his newsletter monthly. I think he made some really interesting points through the pandemic
 about how it was very similar to the 2000 experience where in the lead up to the year 2000,
 not a lot of people remember we had this Y2K scare. A lot of companies upgraded their servers
 and computers and everything in 1999 in anticipation or worry about that things were going
 to stop working when the calendar rolled from 99 to 2000. It sounds silly now, but those are real
 concerns. What they led up to was a big glut of demand in the wake of that. Everybody
 upgraded all their stuff. They pulled demand several years ahead. What's that? They pulled
 demand several years ahead. They pulled it forward and then left a vacuum. I think we've seen
 something similar through the pandemic when all the people decided to work from home and all these
 things. There are some parallels there. I think what we've seen over the last year or two
 is this vacuum of demand materialized. That was the catalyst for the decline in the stock
 market last year in 2022, as you saw demand for all of these. The magnificent seven all saw revenue
 growth decline significantly, profits decline. Then we had this magic AI narrative that
 essentially Satya Nadella got behind at Microsoft and created this boom in AI.
 What I think people don't necessarily appreciate about AI is that what has made a lot of these
 companies successful, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, is the fact that they have been able to sell
 picks and shovels during a gold rush. I talked about before how we had this
 massive VC investment in startups. All these startups needed to advertise on Instagram and
 Google and YouTube and all these things. They needed to buy cloud services from Google and
 Amazon and Microsoft. They needed software to run their businesses. This huge VC boom created a boom
 for the magnificent seven companies. It was terrifically profitable for them to sell into this.
 But now, if you look at what is AI, for me, it's very interesting to see Microsoft rise today
 on the news regarding open AI. There's been some criticism, but I don't think there's been enough
 of these big tech companies where Microsoft says we're going to invest 10 billion, 15 billion into
 open AI. Open AI is going to turn around and invest that right in the Azure cloud. It's
 essentially Microsoft's money going to open AI and right back to Microsoft so they can count it as
 revenue again. It's legal, but it's not necessarily a sustainable business model to recycle your own
 cash into something that might not be sustainable without you. Microsoft, bringing Sam Altman in
 house to do AI, turns it from selling picks and shovels to somebody panning for gold, open AI,
 to we're going to start panning for gold ourselves now. We're going to have you investing massively
 in AI. It depresses cash flow. You're spending a lot of money instead of investing in open AI.
 You're spending that money in CapEx. That, to me, is a fundamental difference. It's going from
 selling the picks and shovels to actually panning. Google's doing the same thing.
 Meta's doing the same thing. Amazon's doing the same thing. What we've seen since they've been
 massively investing just over the last year or two, free cash flow is falling at these companies.
 They all trade now 50, 60 times free cash flow. At the same time, it's free cash flow is coming down
 because their CapEx is going through the roof. They better have a massive return on all this
 investment because if they don't, these stock prices are going to be massively overvalued,
 and they're not going to generate the profits to support them. I think this whole AI boom,
 right now we're in the phase of everybody's all excited about what's going to generate,
 but if it doesn't generate the profits to support all of the CapEx, these companies are going to
 have a problem. There's probably no company that's priced a fantasy right now as much as Nvidia.
 In the news that came out this weekend, which I'm still catching up on, but it seems that
 one of the projects that Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, was working on was the Skunk Works
 project to get a whole bunch of funding to be able to create a different type of competing
 solution to Nvidia here and basically come up with a better performing chip that underpriced
 what Nvidia is doing. So to your point, as all the sharks start kind of turning on each other,
 we have these companies that are priced at or near fantasy, and not all of them can be the
 winner take all victor here. So just almost sort of by logic, a number of today's valuations are
 going to have to be regrounded at some point. I think so, and I think investors are going to
 notice that the price to free cash flow numbers are really the way you want to value these
 companies. And when I say 50 to 60 times, I'm backing out stock based compensation. I think
 that a lot of companies add that back into free cash flow, but the evaluation expert like Aswath
 Damodaran will tell you that that is a cost of doing business. It shouldn't be added back to
 cash flow. So when you look at the valuation of these companies, and I literally, when I say 50,
 60 times, I'm taking their total market cap and aggregating it and then taking their total free
 cash flow from all seven of these companies and aggregating it. And you got 50 plus multiple.
 And the thing is that's so difficult is a 50 multiple might be not a big deal for a small
 company that's growing 30, 40, 50% a year, the free cash flow. These companies are now
 free cash flows like flat or negative year over year.
 And the revenue growth for Apple, it's the worst in two decades, revenue growth for Apple,
 but it trades at its highest valuation since before they introduced the iPhone. So you have
 a huge mismatch here in terms of the valuation multiples and the real growth. And so this is
 where I think it's a very interesting time because you look at all these companies, they're starting
 to create the AI products that are going out into the marketplace. And so far, Microsoft is the only
 company that's been able to actually charge anything for it. It's not showing up really in
 their earnings yet because it's so small, but most every other company, whether it's Adobe or
 any other Intuit, it said, okay, we're going to create these AI products, but we're going to just
 include them in the pricing. So it's not enhancing profitability. It's not creating more revenue
 so far. But the valuations right now suggest that the AI boom is going to be massively profitable
 for these companies, just as the iPhone was when it was introduced and just as
 cloud was for Amazon when they first started doing that. I think that that is a really big risk is
 that AI is not nearly as profitable as the markets currently price it out to be.
 Okay. Well, I mean, I guess the answer is we're going to see, right? So we'll be tracking it over
 the coming quarters and years and whatever. And Jesse, we'll have you back on a lot to kind of
 tell us what you see on a play-by-play basis. I want to get to a few other charts that you've
 put up because we're heading sort of towards a couple mega questions that I want to ask you about
 where the market's headed. Clearly you're saying, look, the tech sector has got its concerns. And
 again, as I mentioned earlier, that's the sector that's been basically responsible for all of the
 indices gains this year. So obviously if that one stumbles, if there's no sector to step up and
 assume the torch, which I don't know, I don't really see one that's got that much market
 waiting ready to do that in the wings, but we'll see what you think. But still staying at this
 higher level of these three key points you mentioned. So you talked about geopolitics
 where we're kind of reshoring and taking on the expense of rejiggering supply chains.
 Part of that too, and I don't want to get into it too much because we could talk about it forever,
 but there's sort of Zoltan Posnar's point about the rise of the bricks as a trading block.
 And I'm not necessarily getting to the competing currency or whatnot, but just that they're going
 to be trading more with one another going forward than they have in the past, where in the past the
 US and some of the big Western countries were kind of used to being first at the trough.
 Hey, we're going to be able to buy as much as we want from you at the best price volume discount.
 And the word that Zoltan uses is that commodities are going to become increasingly encumbered
 going forward, which basically means they're just being promised to other people besides us. So the
 US will probably still be the biggest buyer, but they'll show up and they'll say, "Okay,
 we want to buy X amount of this." And they'll say, "Well, we don't really have that amount for you.
 We're going to give you less. We've got some, but we don't have as much as you want. And because
 these other -- we've already done contracts with these other guys, and because there's more demand
 for it while your price is going to go higher than what it was." So that's just going to be
 inflationary, along with the supply chain rebuilding. The other inflationary trend you
 talked about was the demographics, where we had this glut of workers, both domestic and foreign,
 that really drove down the cost of production from a labor standpoint. Now that's going into
 reverse. Globalization is going into reverse, as we talked about, and the boomers are retiring.
 And we can also have sort of a side conversation, too, about how well-skilled the labor force
 replacing the boomers are. But I think there's data out there that shows that it's not of the
 quality that the boomer generation was at the same age in terms of their ability to apply trades and
 do stuff. Interesting discussion. But again, that's inflationary. That just means fewer workers who
 are going to cost more, and we're already seeing that. I mean, coming out of COVID now, we've had a
 lot of unions stand up and say, "Look, we want to be paid what we're worth." So the cost of labor
 is going up, which is impacting the cost of production. So that's all inflationary. So where
 I'm going with this is this chart that you wrote about relatively recently, which is from John
 Hussman, who we talk about a lot in this program. But if we're looking at the federal debt expressed
 as mortgage payments over these periods of time, we see it going up pretty dramatically. I've got
 another chart here, too, about just the surge in the US pile of debt here. These are annualized
 payments on the US debt, and they have just gone ballistic. I mean, it's more than doubled
 in the past two years. And so we've got this sort of financial side of inflation
 contributing to this, too, as the cost of our debt just gets more and more expensive. So talk
 about the importance of these two charts. Yeah, I mean, this is another dynamic that I've been
 watching closely. I think back in May or June, I wrote a piece for my subscribers called The Most
 Important Chart in the World, and I was talking about the 10-year Treasury yield. It looked to me
 like it was getting ready to break out higher, and that really fit very closely with a macro narrative
 that I was tracking that really came from the likes of Ray Dalio, and Bridgewater has been
 talking about a "liquidity hole." And that's essentially just the fact that the supply of
 Treasuries is growing so much faster than the demand for them, right? We've seen demand from
 foreigners for Treasuries has at least plateaued, if not kind of rolled over, at the same time as
 the Fed has gone from a major buyer to they're not selling, but they're not reinvesting. So you
 have demand that's fallen significantly for Treasuries, while supplies are just literally
 growing exponentially. We're at the point now where we're having to sell new debt just to fund
 the interest on our debt. And I think Dalio was again on CNBC last week saying, "This is the
 acceleration point. This is the point of no return, essentially, where the debt growth starts to
 accelerate." And for me, you can say, "Okay, well, maybe he has an agenda." But when you have Bill
 Dudley, former head of the New York Fed, who's been writing all year, I mean, since the very
 beginning of the year, that he would be surprised if we didn't see turbulence was the term that he
 used in the Treasury market based on the supply-demand mismatch. And you have Larry
 Summers, former Treasury Secretary, talking about the potential for a debt crisis. So when you have,
 I mean, Paul Tudor Jones has warned about this recently also, that all of the smartest people
 in the markets, and even on the government side of things, are suggesting that the fiscal policy
 is reaching kind of this point of no return, where the debt growth is going to start to spiral.
 And I think that is another dynamic that's really important to pay close attention to, because
 I think at some point, the Fed can only do so much. What's going to have to happen, I think,
 is the bond vigilantes are going to have to send a very clear message to the federal government that
 this path is not sustainable, and you're going to have to make some major changes in terms of
 spending and in terms of taxes in order to kind of create a plan, a fiscal plan, for kind of getting
 the house back in order. But I think it's going to take market signals to kind of make that happen.
 So I do think there's potential for higher long-term interest rates over the next several
 months and quarters just due to this supply-demand mismatch. And I think that's a really important
 dynamic that fits along with these other things that we're talking about.
 OK. So there's several things that are wrapped up in there. So kind of at the core right now
 is the supply issue. You're saying demand for treasuries, not really budging all that much,
 but supply is going through the roof. Part of that is because of-- well, part of it happened
 because we had to refill the TGA. I think that's refilled, but I actually don't know. Do you know,
 is that part of the treasury issuance done? Yes. I mean, I think it's back to 700 billion
 or something like that. So it's probably mostly there.
 All right. So the remaining issuance then is just to fund the deficit spending that's
 been going on this year, which is, from historical precedent's perspective, extremely high. It's
 extremely high percent of GDP. I've talked about this a lot on this channel, particularly in an
 era like this where we're not at war. And I know some people tell me, well, hey, we're funding
 these wars. Yeah, OK, we're contributing to some military operations, but we're not at war like we
 were at World War I or World War II. We were committing troops, and we were rejiggering our
 economy about manufacturing war material and stuff like that. But the only other times in history
 where we've been this high a percent of GDP, we were in World War II. So historically, aberrant
 levels of deficit spending. So I guess that's what's responsible for the rest. So I guess game
 this out for us. So the vigilantes will increasingly-- the bond market will increasingly
 demand higher and higher yields as it gets more and more concerned about this. I guess one of two
 things has to blink. You're saying we're kind of near this inflection point. And I want to dig into,
 I mean, are you worried that we're at a point where the debt crisis literally just becomes
 a runaway conflagration here? Or does it act as a throttle in the system? Like they say sometimes
 for inflation, the cure for high prices are high prices. The cure for this type of stuff is just
 debt gets high enough that the economy just slows enough or the markets crash. You said this is
 going to be solved by market signals. So I guess what do you expect to happen here? Yeah, I mean,
 it's hard to expect anything because we haven't gone through this. But if you look at what's
 happened to kind of other countries throughout history, and this is kind of I think what Ray
 Dalio has pointed to, is you just get to a point where something has to change. And so I think
 we're probably going to get to that point where market forces-- it's hard to know exactly what's
 going to happen. But I think I'll just kind of point to what Bill Dudley has pointed out. He's
 used the term turbulence in the Treasury market. And that's basically just there's not enough
 demand. And there's a lot of issuance. And that's why people are paying close attention to these
 Treasury announcements and Treasury auctions and things because we just had a terrible 30-year
 auction a week or two ago. And that's a sign that these narratives are more than just narratives.
 There is a supply-demand mismatch there. And so I think probably what we're going to be heading
 towards is a time where you do see very poor auctions, maybe a failed auction. You see spikes
 in longer-term interest rates. And it's going to have to be addressed. It's very dangerous for the
 Fed to kind of step in the Treasury market at this point when inflation expectations are already
 elevated. Because if people lose faith in the Fed's commitment to reining in inflation in a
 sustainable way, inflation expectations kind of get out of control. And then that's how you kind
 of get into an inflationary spiral. And that psychology takes off. That's the Fed's worst
 nightmare. So the Fed really would not want to have to be the one to do something, which I think
 is why Jay Powell's like, we're not going to intervene. And if long-term interest rates go up,
 so be it. I think he probably understands that that's the signal that Congress may need to say,
 this can't go on. If 5% on the tenure doesn't wake you up, maybe 6% will. Maybe 7% will wake you up
 and let you know that, OK, something has to change. Now, I think people buying Treasuries today
 are still operating under this old framework. They're still operating. They're not thinking
 about this sea change. So in terms of how these debt dynamics work, I think what people don't
 necessarily think about or appreciate is, if we go into recession, the $2 trillion deficit,
 what happens to that? Revenue comes down even further. And so you get $3 trillion, $4 trillion.
 And so the supply of Treasuries is going to explode at a faster rate once you go into recession.
 So everybody who's thinking that, OK, recession means economy is going to slow and interest rates
 are going to come down could be in for a major surprise if recession actually means deficit
 blows out even wider. Treasury supplies grow dramatically, and interest rates actually go
 up in the onset of recession. That's the thing I think I'm worried about the most right now.
 OK, and that's exactly where I was taking this. So thank you for bringing that up. So we've had--
 I'd say with the people I've talked to recently, there's a lot of signals that they're seeing in
 common. But one of the areas where people are diverging is on where they think inflation's
 headed. We have some that are like you, I think, saying, hey, it could be stickier than most people
 realize. And then we've got people like David Rosenberg, who I interviewed a week ago, who
 basically is expecting a one-handle on CPI by the end of next year. But another one is bonds. And
 those are somewhat-- Well, I don't necessarily-- I just want to point out, I wouldn't necessarily
 disagree with Rosie. There's the cyclical forces of inflation, right? Now, from a cyclical
 perspective, inflation is coming down right now, for sure. I don't disagree with that. And I don't
 know how low it'll get. It might get down to below two. But I think my point is, over the next five
 years, 10 years, we're probably not going to stay below two. You're right. And that wasn't fair of
 me to compare the two. You are talking about the secular sea change here, where Rosie in the
 conversation was talking about the next 12 months. Yeah. Yeah. So that wasn't an apples-to-apples
 comparison. So I'm glad you chimed in with that. But I think there are some people that still
 have a-- that aren't on the secular inflation rise yet. And then bonds in the near term.
 That's one of those other areas where I'd say-- I don't know if it's 50-50, but there are
 definitely some that are saying, most attractive time to buy bonds that I've seen in my career.
 This is the time to go out in the long duration US treasuries in advance of a recession coming
 or something breaking under this high cost of capital, which we haven't even talked about yet.
 And Fed has to intervene. And all of a sudden, the biggest buyer of treasuries who's been sitting
 on their hands for the past year and a half is all of a sudden back buying them. And there's
 the crisis trade, where fear trade, everybody's piling back into treasury. So there's definitely
 that argument that says, hey, looking out for the next 6 to 12 months, US treasuries look really
 attractive. Then there's the argument that you just made, which is like, might not be the time
 this yet. So it's very helpful for people to have a clear understanding of what each side is using
 to rationalize this position. I appreciate you taking the time to do that. Yeah. And I would just
 say, too, that if you do think the Fed is going to pivot and have to intervene in the treasury market,
 I do think we're probably headed for yield curve control over the next several years. Because if
 you do believe we're on an unsustainable debt path, the Fed will be forced. I think we've
 already been in an era of fiscal dominance for years. If you just look at the trajectory of debt
 to GDP and the Fed balance sheet to GDP, they marry each other almost perfectly. And I think
 that was the first sign to me that, okay, the Fed is now subservient to the needs of the fiscal
 authority. That I think will get more obvious in the next few years if they're forced into yield
 curve control. Like, okay, we literally cannot service our debt at a 6%, 7%, 8% interest rate,
 so Fed's going to have to pin them somewhere lower. But if you believe that's going to happen,
 right, your bonds, maybe you're going to get pinned at four or pinned at three or something.
 That caps your upside is very limited. But if the Fed does that, even while inflation is high
 and fiscal issues are a problem, I think a much better trade is probably precious metals. The gold
 price goes to the moon in that scenario. I don't think you can imagine a more bullish scenario
 for gold than that type of scenario. Now, I think Jay Powell is going to be really,
 really reluctant to intervene in treasuries. He's going to do everything he can to avoid
 intervening in treasuries because he understands that inflation psychology may be the most
 important thing he has to try and manage. So he cannot make it look like the Fed is going to do
 anything other than bring inflation back under control. But if he is forced to pivot for some
 reason, and maybe that's because interest rates are kind of getting out of hand on the upside,
 that means very dollar bearish and very, very bullish for precious metals. So I think
 if that is your scenario that you think recession is going to happen, the Fed's going to pivot,
 you should probably be buying precious metals instead of treasuries.
 Okay, I know you gave a little nod earlier to hard assets, too. We're going to return to that
 right as we begin to wrap things up here, but this topic about what happens in the
 currency in this type of future that you see coming. I think you just made some very important
 points there. Going back to Hussman for a second, he said the following. He was quoting economist
 Peter Bernholtz and said, and I'm a little low to bring this up because it's a bit of a charged
 term, but it in some way captures a little bit of the spirit of what you're talking about. I'm
 curious kind of how big a risk to the purchasing power of the currency you see going ahead in the
 sea change of the next decade or two, but Bernholtz's quote was, "In all cases of hyperinflation,
 deficits accounting to more than 20% of public expenditures are present." You noted that we've
 exceeded that level in each of the past five years. So I hate to use the word hyperinflation
 because everybody starts thinking about, "Oh my god, we're going into Zimbabwe or Weimar Germany
 tomorrow," but if we just think about it as a challenge to the purchasing power of the currency
 that we have, how worrisome is it that we've been above this 20% of public expenditures threshold
 for the past half decade? I think the best thing that I would point to is -- I don't know. I think
 it's basically interesting to point out that this is a condition. The condition is there. That
 doesn't mean it's actually going to happen. It means the window is open to that type of a
 possibility. All I would say is that there are a lot of smarter people around the world that
 are reacting to this than me. I'm talking about foreign central banks. What are foreign central
 banks doing? They're buying gold against the risk that this type of a scenario unfolds. That's not
 saying they're betting on it happening. They're just saying that if it does happen, I want to be
 prepared. That's why you're seeing record gold buying by central banks around the world. Even
 some foreign central bankers talking about, "We might have to go back because the monetary and
 fiscal policy has been so insane over the past few years." They might see a future. I can't remember
 which central banker was talking about this, but it was head of one of the smaller ones saying,
 "We might be headed for a new gold standard at some point over the next several years.
 If that's the case, we want to be prepared. We want to build up our gold reserves now."
 Again, to prepare for that type of an outcome. Those are all the possibilities
 for where we're headed. I don't think it's possible to forecast how any of this unfolds,
 but I do think the risk is there. >> That's where I was going. By the way,
 I think it might have been the Dutch central bank that made that announcement. When you talk about
 yield curve control, you talk about the threats to the purchasing power of the currency that we're
 raising here. That's what I was looking for, a finger to the wind. How concerned should the
 regular investor be about this? What I hear you saying is concerned enough to be putting some
 percentage of your portfolio into a real asset or something that's likely going to hold its
 purchasing power better in an inflationary regime. >> Yeah, absolutely. I would just point out that
 you suggested that the deficit to GDP right now during an economic-- We're 8% or something,
 fiscal deficit to GDP. In the 1960s, that went to about 2.5% of GDP. That was the late '60s. That
 was the foundation for the inflationary decade of the '70s. If 2.5% deficit to GDP-- I'm talking
 about during an economic expansion. You expect the deficit to blow out during recession.
 Normally, the way that monetary and fiscal policy work is that when economy is good,
 the deficit narrows. That's when we prepare for a rainy day. What we've been doing during this
 economic expansion is just the opposite, where we've seen the deficit just blow out dramatically.
 I do think that the risk is there, and it's probably greater than it's ever been before
 for a debt crisis and a persistent inflation problem for a prolonged period of time.
 >> All right, so you're raising warning flags about secular inflation from here,
 the potential unfolding of a debt crisis. Here we are. We're at a period of time where the market
 is richly valued. This basically is contrasting the PE ratio of the S&P with Treasury bonds and
 basically showing that stocks are quite overvalued compared to bonds. One of two things has to happen,
 which is stocks have to come down in price, or bond yields have to come down. Maybe both. Who
 knows? Maybe they meet in the middle or whatnot. But you have this other chart, too, which shows
 that the concentration of gains amongst the biggest stocks that we're seeing right now
 is something that typically happens at the end of bull markets, not the start. So are you also
 basically kind of throwing a market correction into the mix of risks here? >> I think it's bigger
 than a correction. I think we've been in the bear market since early 2021, really since that meme
 stock frenzy with GameStop and AMC and stuff. That was really in early February, March of 2021.
 That was a speculative mania like we've rarely seen around the world. I think we saw it in 1999.
 We saw it in 1929. We saw it in Japan in the late '80s. But we saw when people were trading stocks
 the way that they were and cryptocurrencies and the craziness, and even still with single-day,
 zero-day options and these types of things, the way that those always unwind is in a speculative
 bust. And 2022 was, I think, just the beginning of that. Jeremy Grantham is probably the best,
 most experienced and knowledgeable bubble watcher that I've ever seen and very good at calling these
 things. And he said he studied, I don't know how many dozens of bubbles around the world,
 and every single one of them has deflated to at least a normalized valuation ratio over time.
 That would take the S&P 500 back down. That's why I'm really glad you showed that chart between
 interest rates and valuations, because if interest rates stay where they are, valuations have to come
 down a lot. And so this is probably the best chart to show investors betting on a soft landing.
 Investors are betting on interest rates are going to come back down to 2.5% without a recession.
 If rates come back to 2.5% because of recession, corporate earnings are going to tank and the
 valuation will be even much, much, much higher than it is. So yeah, there's a few different
 ways that gap closes. But the way that markets are betting today, that interest rates come down
 without a recession is probably, I think, the least likely of all of them. If you don't get
 a recession, valuations probably start to normalize towards that lower level. But I think it's
 probably most likely that you get a combination closure there, where you do get a recession,
 get interest rates come down potentially a bit, and valuations have to come down a lot.
 And stock prices actually have to fall faster than valuations because earnings are falling in
 that scenario too. So I do think we are in a bear market that is almost three years old now. In early
 2024, it'll be three years old, but probably has a ways to go before the stock market fully unwinds
 the speculative mania that we saw a few years ago. Alright, I just interviewed Ken Oakley. That
 interview is going to air after this one, Jesse, but he shares a similar viewpoint of view on that
 and he says all bear markets end in capitulation and there's kind of a washout, a flushing that
 happens at the end of bear markets. And he just said we didn't see any of that in 2022. There was
 no capitulation in that sort of orderly market decrease. Obviously, things have re-inflated here
 in 2023. So he's expecting at some point, but probably next year, to see that bear market
 capitulation. Sounds like you're sort of expecting similar? Yeah, I do think bear markets always end
 in panic. And what I worry about most today is that we haven't seen that panic yet in the bond
 market. And so if the bond market still has pain ahead of it, that means interest rates are still
 going even higher. And that valuation, the gap between equity valuations and interest rates gets
 even wider and creates even more pain for the stock market. So I don't think we've seen capitulation
 yet in the bond market. And so if we are in this kind of new inflationary regime and a secular
 inflationary regime, you may need to see some capitulation in bonds before you can even think
 about stock prices have actually done enough to reflect the new reality. That's so interesting
 for two reasons. Treasury bonds have never had three consecutive down years since we started
 keeping records at the end of the 1700s. They're going to have that third year this year, it looks
 like, unless something miraculous happens. What I hear you saying is there maybe could be a fourth
 year. Who knows? I mean, maybe we capitulate and recover next year or two, but it could get even
 worse is what I hear you saying. Yeah, I know. Med Faber has a great study, though, where he's
 looked back at every single asset class. And when they have two down years in a row, returns going
 forward are usually pretty good. Three down years in a row, returns are pretty good. You rarely see
 four in almost any asset class. But I think it was in 2015 that I wrote a piece kind of highlighting
 his research about gold price I think had been down three or four years in a row in 2015. And
 since then, it's been great to be an investor in precious metals. I don't know if we're in for
 another down year for bonds. What I worry about is more that scenario kind of like we saw in the UK,
 where you have some volatility in the market, spiking kind of interest rates that create some
 type of an intervention. And I think that we're probably headed for something like that. And I
 can't imagine that stock prices would just kind of still be on soft landing nirvana with that kind of
 turbulence in the treasury market. OK. All right. I was going to ask a question, which we don't have
 to get real into, but is obviously if interest rates go even higher. And I know you're expecting
 kind of like a break moment or it's going to be violent but short. But if it weren't, if interest
 rates kept going to six plus or whatever. I mean, there's a good argument made that the US economy
 can't sustain the cost of capital where we are today. And that we're just waiting for the lag
 effect to catch up with us. I mean, it's six plus or whatever. My brain just has a really hard time
 seeing as being able to sustain any of that. I assume you feel somewhat similar, but maybe not.
 No, absolutely right. I mean, I think we're already at a point of interest rates where the
 housing market is starting to shut down. And I mean, prices are still elevated because there's
 no supplies. But fewer and fewer people can afford to buy a home. You look at the small business
 surveys and they're all saying we can't afford to take out new loans to invest in anything. And
 small business is usually a good leading indicator for big business because like Facebook has said,
 the majority of their businesses is selling to small business. And that's true for so many
 companies. And so it's a good leading indicator. And small businesses are very clear that they've
 been suffering and they're worried about their ability to sustain business over the next several
 quarters. So yeah, I think we're already at the point where interest rates are doing damage.
 So yeah, further spike in interest rates, especially because, and I just make this final
 point, that so many fortune 500 CFOs have debt that they need to refinance over the next year or
 two. And they're making the same bet as the soft landing group that, okay, if we just hold off as
 long as we can, interest rates next year will be lower. Okay, now we can refinance our debt.
 If that doesn't happen and interest rates are just where they are today or even higher, then you're
 going to have a real default cycle in corporate credit. And so yeah, if interest rates go up
 instead of as CFOs anticipate coming down, then you have real problems. And that obviously ripples
 through the economy. Yeah, that'll be the barrage of silver bullets that takes down all the zombie
 companies that have been able to limp along right now. Yeah. All right, well, look, Jesse is, we're
 here at the end of the hour. And I mean, I could just talk for hours and hours with you. So we're
 going to have to start landing the plane here. Last big question before I just wrap everything
 up, which is, okay, so you've just sketched out for us in detail these concerns you have
 both about the next five plus years, but also a lot of those shoes are going to start dropping
 from here. How do you think the prudent investor should consider positioning for this? Are there
 assets that you particularly like in this environment? Are there ones that you wouldn't
 touch with a 10-foot pole? Sounds like you wouldn't be going long bonds right now,
 given your outlook. No, and I would just point out that historically, he's not known for it,
 but Warren Buffett has been one of the best bond investors for the past 40 plus years. We're
 leading into recession when he's built up cash at Richard Hathaway. He's invested a lot in zero
 coupon bonds, anticipating the interest rates to come down. He owns no zeros today. It's all short
 term treasury bills. That to me is a clear sign that he shares my concerns that, hey, it's great
 to get 5% short term, but there's really no reason to invest longer term. I think the key for
 investors today is be conservative and diversified. I think a lot of investors are far too heavily
 invested in equities, in US equities in particular. Foreign equities are generally much better priced
 in terms of valuations. I think a lot of people don't think about diversifying across multiple
 asset classes. If they do, they own the 60/40 portfolio, 60 equities, 40% bonds, but that leaves
 a huge category out of the equation, which is real assets. I think this is maybe the key thing that I
 hope people take away from this is that it's been fine if you've been under-invested in real assets
 for the last 10, 15 years. Historically, if you're under-invested in real assets, you go through very
 difficult periods in your portfolio, like you did through the 1970s, where inflation just ravishes
 financial assets, the value of financial assets in your portfolio. If you don't have something
 to offset that in that type of a difficult environment like real assets, then the portfolio
 suffers. In terms of real assets, I'm just pointing out things like precious metals,
 commodities. I think I like TIPS, inflation-protected securities,
 and even real estate to an extent. Obviously, commercial real estate is
 pretty dangerous today in terms of offices. I don't know how much of that is effectively
 priced in now because it's become such a small sector relative to the others.
 Residential may have problems of its own, but I think one thing that people don't necessarily
 appreciate about residential is we did go through a capital cycle there too, where we had the real
 estate bust in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012. We massively under-invested in residential real
 estate. Now, the prices that we're seeing in real estate are the result of that under-investment.
 Until we get back to a cycle of massive over-investment in residential real estate,
 like we saw in 2004, 2005, 2006, I don't think we're going to see a major top in residential
 real estate value. Real estate is just part of that larger framework, but I really think
 commodities and precious metals, adding those things to the portfolio to just add to the
 diversification is really critical. All right. I just put up a chart here, Jesse. I hope you can
 see it. But again, I pulled this from your Twitter feed this morning. This is basically a chart that
 says, hey, look, when looking at real assets, if you want to look at the historical ebbs and flows
 of that sector, it's definitely been at a nadir. And it actually maybe looks like it may have
 hit a bottom there in 2021. And if it indeed is on a secular upswing here, there's a far
 way to go just to get to the historic mean. Oh, yeah, absolutely. And this is why I've been
 kind of pounding the table for a few years now that we are in the early stages of a
 commodity super cycle because, I mean, if you look at that, real assets have never been cheaper in 100
 years than they are today. They're still, even after the performance that we've seen in energy
 stocks and in oil prices and in precious metals over the last few years, really since, like I said,
 2015, it's barely made a dent in this. And so I think when you just think about real
 assets are still cheaper relative to financial assets than they've ever been before in history,
 it makes a lot of sense from a fundamental standpoint, not even from, ignore all the
 macro stuff that we've talked about today, just from a valuation fundamental standpoint,
 makes sense to have an allocation there. And then if you do believe any of the kind
 of macro arguments that I've made today, then you think that that recent uptick
 probably has a very strong tailwind that lasts a number of years.
 All right. Well, Jesse, look, like I said, I'd love to keep on going, but I got to be respectful
 of you and your time. For folks that have really enjoyed this conversation and would like to follow
 you in your work, where should they go? I try and put up a blog post once a week at thefelderreport.com.
 That's also where I write a weekly market comment for my premium subscribers and specific trade
 ideas, typically on a weekly basis and a weekly chart book, running down kind of the trends and
 things that I see across a multitude of different markets. I'm also fairly active still on Twitter.
 It's just @jessefelder, looking for an alternative. So if you have any blue sky invites for me, Adam,
 hat in hand, looking for an alternative. It's a shame to see something that's been so valuable
 to me, I mean, to meet people like you through Twitter and Fred. And it's been a wonderful
 place to do that, but it seems like it's kind of gone the wrong direction the last year or so.
 But still, I find a terrific amount of value. So I'm still reluctantly very active on Twitter
 @jessefelder. Okay. Yeah. And to your question about blue sky, I heard about it from you,
 Jesse. So I put my name in for you. Okay. Whoever gets one first, but I'm sure they're probably
 coming to you before me. All right. Well, look, this has been fantastic. Folks,
 if you'd like to thank Jesse for coming on the program here and giving so much of his time to us,
