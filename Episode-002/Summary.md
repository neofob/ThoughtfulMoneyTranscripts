### Summary

1. The period from 1981-82 to 2020 was a "heaven" for financial assets,
with both bonds and stocks returning superior returns. However, this period
of favorable conditions has come to an end as of January 2022.

2. From here on out, returns will be disappointing for most people, especially
those aiming at high returns such as 10-12%. The typical stock hasn't done
well and portfolio performance has been lackluster.

3. Emerging markets have underperformed the US for many years and are now
relatively inexpensive compared to the US. In contrast, technology stocks are
highly valued while material stocks, particularly energy and energy-related
stocks, are relatively cheap.

4. The low in interest rates seen in May/August 2020 is unlikely to be
repeated and we are now entering a rising inflation wave and rising interest
rate structure that could last for 20-30 years. However, there may be counter
moves and volatility in the markets.

5. The global economy is facing stagflation, with most countries reporting
figures indicating stagnant economic activity and diminishing standards of
living for most people. Inflationary pressures are expected to continue,
potentially leading to high inflation rates in the future.
